These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Asura_Path"}

Furthermore, it does not activate automatically like the Shield of Sand does (instead relying on Gaara to apply when needed), nor is it as resilient;[1] wherever part of the Armour of Sand is struck, that section of it crumbles away.

The dragon itself is capable of flight, and, while Deidara is safely on its back, the dragon can spit out smaller clay figures that attack the opponent like guided missiles.\nThese independent missile-like creatures take the form of a greatly reduced version of the larger dragon that created them, however, despite this decrease in size they are still relatively larger than a normal person. Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space.

The chakra, when visible, is shaped into two large butterfly wings that can be compressed into smaller wings. The technique uses an enormous amount of chakra. In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as Butterfly Bullet Bombing, and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.\nThere are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's Three Coloured Pills, which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as Calorie Control (\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb , Karor\u012b Kontor\u014dru); because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.\nIn the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 271\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 67", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Butterfly_Mode"}

Understanding this theory, the Body Revival Technique can repair the user's body and increase its strength by manipulating the \"Destruction and Rebirth\" cycle of the muscles.\nThis technique allows the user to survive any otherwise normally fatal damage and instantly heal from the damage. A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented medical-nins.\nWhen combined with Dark Chakra, this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinn\u014d's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all Eight Gates, without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Revival_Technique"}

When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals. Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves. But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement other than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.[1]\nThe target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as Kabuto Yakushi demonstrates.

This allows him to escape from bindings and regenerate from attacks. Due to these resulting trails of fluid, Kabuto can inhibit sensing techniques from detecting him, such as d\u014djutsu.

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Recreation_Technique"}

It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech. By infusing chakra into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit. Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to awaken (\u899a\u9192, Kakusei) as an obedient follower of the user.\nThe illusion itself is cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it. Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely. Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic_Illusion:_Cajolery_of_Glamour"}

In other uses, it can repel incoming projectiles, soften the ground for use as a cushion, and knock over people. Its power weakens sharply over distances.[1]\nZaku can use this technique with one hand against a single target or with both hands to use against separate targets.[4] It can be used with both hands towards a single purpose,[5] which in certain cases qualifies as Extreme Decapitating Airwaves. Despite how useful this technique is and how easy it is for Zaku to perform,[1] the tubes in his arms represent a serious vulnerability: if the openings of the tubes are blocked when Zaku tries to use it, the energy won't be able to get out and will burst from his elbows, severing them from his body.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 188\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 70\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 69\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 53", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Decapitating_Airwaves"}

The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Delicate_Illness_Extraction_Technique"}

It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.[1] When Hiruzen Sarutobi performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.[3] When Minato Namikaze performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.[4] Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.[5]\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,[3] and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.[5] With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the Shadow Clone Technique.[3] The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the Nine-Tails' yin chakra, leaving its yang chakra alone.[6]\nWhen Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.[5] Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,[7] he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.[8]\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.[3] In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its jinch\u016briki.[9] With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.[8] The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.[4] The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land,[10] instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.[5]\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing hand seals and by extension most ninjutsu.[8] With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.[11] Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.[12] Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.[13] He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,[14] but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.[15]\n\n    Souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.  \nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d\u30fb\u89e3, Shiki F\u016bjin: Kai, English TV: Reaper Death Seal: Release). To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami. If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.[15]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Demon_Consuming_Seal"}

Because applying cursed seals in the first place requires a great deal of skill, suppressing one with this technique also requires a great deal of skill. The preparations needed for this technique are quite arduous:[1] users write several long lines of symbols in their own blood, which trail from the cursed seal through the surrounding area. Once this is completed and the technique is activated, the symbols converge towards and surround the cursed seal,[2] the blood acting as a chain that prevents the cursed seal from spreading.[1] Applying the Evil Sealing Method is quite painful, and recipients are likely to pass out after receiving it.[2]\nThe Evil Sealing Method can only suppress cursed seals, not remove them.[1] Its power also relies on the will of the recipient: if the recipient wants it to work, then it will fight off the cursed seal's effects as much as it can; but if the user would rather the cursed seal activated, the Evil Sealing Method will be powerless to prevent it.[2] For this reason, after Kakashi Hatake suppresses Sasuke Uchiha's Cursed Seal of Heaven, Kakashi takes efforts to train Sasuke so that he won't be tempted by the cursed seal's power, notably teaching him the Chidori.[3] This ends up not being enough for Sasuke and he willingly accepts the Cursed Seal of Heaven's influence. Over the following years, the Evil Sealing Method remains imprinted upon him, but inert since Sasuke has no need for it. When the cursed seal is ultimately removed, the Evil Sealing Method is removed as well.[4]\nIn the anime, Kurenai Y\u016bhi uses this technique to hold back the Kurama Clan's Kekkei Genkai.[5]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Rin no Sho, page 219\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 Naruto chapter 69\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 177\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 392\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 205", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Sealing_Method"}

Neji Hy\u016bga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. Using their Byakugan's near-360\u00b0 field of vision, the Hy\u016bga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol. The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu. Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body and making it difficult for them to move.[1] Alternatively, the sixty-four strikes can be split amongst multiple targets, such as to to deflect incoming projectiles.[2]\nThe sixty-four strikes are broken into six smaller sets. Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.[3] As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.[4] The six sets of strikes are:\n\nTwo consecutive strikes.\nTwo more consecutive strikes, totalling four.\nFour consecutive strikes, totalling eight.\nEight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.\nSixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.\nThirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sixty-Four_Palms"}

If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's chakra to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.[1] In the anime, this seal is intended to encourage tailed beasts to aid the jinch\u016briki they've been sealed within, as the more they provide chakra, the weaker the seal becomes, and thus the better their chance of freedom.[5]\n\n    The sealing altar.  \nMinato Namikaze used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the Nine-Tails into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki. Before Minato performed the seal, he summoned a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.[6] Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.[7] As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, Kushina Uzumaki, into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it,[8] and then reinforces the seal;[9] Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a new seal, and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.[10]\n\n     The Nine-Tails within Naruto's subconscious.  \nWhen Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways. The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising. The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them,[11] but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.[12] The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with \"seal\" (\u5c01) written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.[13] When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.[12]\n\n     Naruto preparing the key to the seal.  \nBecause the seal itself would naturally weaken over time, Minato created a key for it that can strengthen the seal when needed. He inscribed the key on the abdomen of the scroll toad, Gerotora, and sent it to Jiraiya for safekeeping. Jiraiya, believing that Minato wanted Naruto to use the Nine-Tails against some threat, instead uses the key to slightly weaken the seal, giving Naruto greater access to the Nine-Tails' chakra.[14] After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.[13]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sealing_Style"}

It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's Chakra Pathway System, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck. To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system. Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name \"gentle\" fist.\nBy employing the use of the Byakugan, an experienced user[1] can target the tenketsu, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network. These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, is a powerful tactical option to have. The affected person's chakra flow can either be increased or disrupted completely, preventing them from using techniques as seen in Neji's fight with Hinata during the Ch\u016bnin Exams, rendering her own Gentle Fist manoeuvres ineffective.\nNeji Hy\u016bga noted that any chakra-based substance can be destroyed by this technique. As seen in his fight with Kid\u014dmaru, it is done by leaking chakra from the chakra openings in one's hands and moulding it into a needle-like shape to slice through the chakra.[2] In contrast, Kid\u014dmaru managed to devise a method that prevented the chakra from being injected into the body, thus negating the main impact of the Gentle Fist through physical contact. Because Gentle Fist is mostly taijutsu, some believed users can only emit chakra from their hands due to the hands being the most mobile limbs on the body. However, users can emit chakra from any tenketsu, making binding them with chakra-based substance impossible.\nBeing a close-quarter combat style, Gentle Fist practitioners have a disadvantage against long-range fighters, as Kid\u014dmaru took full advantage of his distance weaponry to overwhelm Neji.\nBecause the chakra pathway system is invisible to the naked eye, the Byakugan is required for most techniques of this style. Since the Byakugan is unique to the Hy\u016bga clan, it has become their signature style of combat. The ability to inflict severe internal trauma with minimal external force, combined with chakra network manipulation, makes the Gentle Fist the most reputable and fearsome taijutsu style known in all of Konohagakure.[3] In contrast to this, the technique can also be used for supplementary purposes displayed when Hinata used the technique to fix Naruto Uzumaki's dislocated shoulder joint during the Fourth Shinobi World War.[4]\nDue to their possession of the Byakugan, the \u014ctsutsuki clan also practices this taijutsu form, though far more aggressive than what the Hy\u016bga clan practices. Momoshiki \u014ctsutsuki demonstrated his while fighting Naruto Uzumaki, targeting Naruto's tenketsu and internal organs to try to incapacitate him.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Gentle_Fist"}

It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the Mangeky\u014d Sharingan and the Rinnegan.\n\nUsage[]\n     The technique utilised through the Rinnegan.  \nBy establishing eye contact with a target, the Sharingan user traps them within a genjutsu which can be exploited for one of various purposes, such as: causing instantaneous \u2014 but temporary \u2014 loss of consciousness or paralysis in the target,[2][3] forceful extraction of information,[4][5] relaying memories,[6] erasing memories,[7] removing genjutsu placed on the target by others,[8] and controlling a target's actions.[9][10]\nMembers of the Uchiha clan are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails, so much so that Konoha quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.[11] Sasuke Uchiha is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu with a mere glance.[12]\nThe illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users. For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers,[13] on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure,[14] and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.[15]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Genjutsu:_Sharingan"}

The senjutsu chakra used during Sage Mode \"activates\" the body in various ways, enhancing the user's speed, reflexes, strength, stamina and durability. This allows a sage to achieve incredible feats which include leaping great distances, shattering sharp materials with their bare hands, as well as lifting massive objects. It is said to be a flawless taijutsu that has no openings in either attack or defence.[1]\nWhen using Frog Kata, the natural energy used by the practitioner to create senjutsu chakra also surrounds the user in an aura of that same natural energy. This aura can act as an extension of their body and cannot be seen by anyone other than those who have trained in senjutsu. By utilising the aura, the user can extend the range and force of their physical attacks. Strikes that seemingly or would normally miss will actually make contact with the target. Only users of Sage Mode can see or sense this aura's extension. Nothing else, not even the Rinnegan can see it. One punch has been shown to have enough force to cripple and completely finish off an opponent, not unlike Chakra Enhanced Strength.\nIn addition, the enhanced speed, reflexes and heightened chakra-sensing from Sage Mode, combined with the skilful body movements of Frog Kata, allows the practitioner to not only evade enemy strikes at the last possible moment, but accurately counterattack an opponent.[2]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Frog_Kata"}

By surrounding their body with chakra and moving about on all fours, the user's speed and accuracy are significantly enhanced, which in turn makes their attacks more damaging. Hit-and-run tactics are the most effective form of attack while using this technique, as this ensures the user is constantly moving, thus making it difficult for opponents to follow their movements.[1]\nThe Four Legs Technique is a favourite of the Inuzuka clan, enabling its members to move in the same way as their ninken partners. Upon activating this technique, Inuzuka gain a more feral appearance: their canine teeth lengthen, their finger and toenails become claw-like, and their pupils turn to slits.[2] Inuzuka will often make using the Four Legs Technique their first priority in a fight, which in turn tends to make it a prerequisite for many of their other jutsu; Kiba Inuzuka refers to the encompassing fighting style as \"Beast Human Taijutsu\" (\u7363\u4eba\u4f53\u8853, J\u016bjin Taijutsu, literally meaning: Beast Human Body Technique).[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Legs_Technique"}

Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,[1] increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.[2] But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.[3]\nHow the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when Ch\u014dji Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.[3] In Part II, when Ch\u014dji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.[4]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Bullet_Tank"}

The bullets are so fast that they are difficult to see. The moment the user has finished preparing the attack, evading it becomes extremely difficult. Using the repellent force of magnetism, the speed of the bullets is rapidly increased after they are shot.

Inner Sakura has the habit of saying \"Sh\u0101nnar\u014d!\" (\u3057\u3083\u30fc\u3093\u306a\u308d\u30fc). The phrase has no literal meaning, but is usually translated as \"Hell yeah!\", \"Hell no!\", or \"Damn it!\", depending on the situation. The English anime translates it as a forceful \"Cha!\" Inner Sakura is unique as it is in a way a second will within Sakura's mind.\nAlthough she appeared quite frequently at the start of the series, Inner Sakura all but disappeared midway through Part I, and rarely appears in Part II. The reason behind this is that she no longer needs to hide her true feelings or reactions behind a fake smile, finally allowing herself to truly say what is on her mind. However, because Inner Sakura usually possessed somewhat violent reactions to things, Sakura is now prone to violent outbursts, which is not helped by her chakra-enhanced strength, making her very scary if one upsets her, similar to her teacher Tsunade.\n\nUsage[]\nDuring the Ch\u016bnin Exams, Inner Sakura was strong enough to repel Ino from Sakura's body when she used the Mind Body Switch Technique on her. In many video games, Inner Sakura was made into a technique for Sakura due to her lack of techniques of her own early self in the series. In most appearances, Inner Sakura is a taijutsu where Sakura's inner feelings burst out and she unleashes all her strength on the target with one or more punches. However, Inner Sakura may also interact with Sakura or the opponent(s) as a clone or genjutsu, as shown with the Clone Combo, The Great Sakura, and the Twinkling Maiden's Heart.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Sakura"}

The cursed seal can also be used by the main house to discipline branch house members: if a main house member uses a special hand seal, the branch house member will experience intense pain, discouraging them from disobeying the main house again. If the pain is great enough, it can even kill the branch house member,[1] destroying their brain cells.[3]\n\n     The cursed seal, activated.  \nMembers of the branch house are branded with the cursed seal on the third birthday of the clan's next heir or heiress, regardless of their own age at the time: Neji received his when he was only four years old, when Hinata turned three. Cursed seals are placed on the recipient's forehead, for which reason they tend to keep it covered, such as with their forehead protector.

The user produces the \"sit\" (\u5ea7, za) kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its jinch\u016briki with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.[3]\nWhen Yamato used this technique to suppress Naruto Uzumaki's four-tailed form, Naruto needed to be in possession of the First Hokage's Necklace to aid in suppressing the Nine-Tails' chakra.\nWhen Hashirama used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinch\u016briki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the tailed beast control through his Wood Release: Wood Human Technique, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast controlled by the Sharingan.[4]\n\nInfluence[]\n\"Jijun\" (\u8033\u9806) is a Japanese term used for people in their sixties. It comes from a saying by Confucius, li\u00f9sh\u00ed \u00e9r \u011brsh\u00f9n (Mandarin Chinese) (\u516d\u5341\u800c\u8033\u9806), that is most commonly translated long the lines of \"At sixty, my ear was obedient\", meaning that at age sixty, one is able to hear all things without being unhappy about them.\nThe last part of this technique's name, \"Kakuan Nitten Suishu\" (\u5ed3\u5eb5\u5165\u913d\u5782\u624b), comes from a famous series of short poems and accompanying images, called the \"Ten Bull Pictures\" (\u5341\u725b\u56f3\uff08\u5341\u725b\u5716\uff09, J\u016bgy\u016b-zu, (Mandarin) Chinese: Sh\u00edni\u00fat\u00fa). The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.\nThey were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called Ku\u00f2\u0101n (\u5ed3\u5eb5, Japanese: Kakuan). The tenth poem talks about how the fully-enlightened herdsman returns to the city to help others reach enlightenment. This poem is called R\u00f9ch\u00e1n Chu\u00edsh\u01d2u (Mandarin Chinese) (\u5165\u913d\u5782\u624b, Japanese: Nitten Suishu), which can be translated as \"entering society with bliss-bringing hands\" (i.e. hands that teach how to reach enlightenment).", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hokage-Style_Sixty-Year-Old_Technique_%E2%80%94_Kakuan_Entering_Society_with_Bliss-Bringing_Hands"}

A successful strike can blow away a target's entire chest with a direct hit, which may not kill them right away, but will ultimately kill them if they are not treated. The attack is rather straightforward, but very quick, powerful and is easily capable of knocking down an opponent.\n\nVariants[]\nWhen Killer B uses this attack, he creates either a chakra cloak or chakra bones, both in the form of bull horns. He refers to this as his \"Eighth\" (\u516b\u672c\u76ee, Happonme) sword, next to his seven conventional katana. In Killer B's Version 2, the Lariat gains an increase in power due to the ox-skull he creates. He was able to pierce Samehada while simultaneously blowing away Kisame Hoshigaki's chest.\nWhen A uses it, he surrounds himself with his Lightning Release Chakra Mode, rather than tailed-beast chakra. His high-level chakra, which is comparable to that of a tailed beast's, would produce the same effect as Killer B's version. The two brothers can combine their efforts to perform a Lightning Release: Double Lariat, which is strong enough to decapitate the victim, even without chakra enhancements, due to the brothers' immense physical strength.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Release:_Lariat"}

It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\". It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Known Hosts or Candidates\n\n2.1 Hosts\n2.2 Candidates\n\n\n3 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThe Living Corpse Reincarnation immortalises one's mind, transferring it to a stronger body before the current host rots. By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.\nOrochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years. It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him. Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime. The fact that he wanted to prepare Sasuke Uchiha and Kimimaro for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.\nTo perform this technique, Orochimaru reveals his true form: a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body. Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim. The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the Sharingan seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers). The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him. Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his Eight Branches Technique after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.\nAfter taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as stretching and bending his body, reconnecting any severed parts, and shedding his skin to heal injuries. This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the \"Power of the White Snake\" (\u767d\u86c7\u306e\u529b, Shirohebi no Chikara).[2] Orochimaru also alters the face of his host to look like his original form.\nAfter being revived through the Evil Releasing Method, Orochimaru seemingly circumvented this process, emerging in a slightly different snake form and then slithering into a White Zetsu clone's mouth.[3]\n\nKnown Hosts or Candidates[]\nHosts[]\nUnknown person \u2014 when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown person \u2014 when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, another one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown female \u2014 for replacing the hand Itachi Uchiha severed; left body to escape the effects of his arms being sealed away.\nGen'y\u016bmaru \u2014 a desperate temporary replacement body before Sasuke Uchiha; left body for Sasuke Uchiha.\nSasuke Uchiha \u2014 after having been absorbed by Sasuke when he reversed his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique, took over due to Itachi's battle with his brother lowering Sasuke's chakra enough for Orochimaru to gain control; was sealed away by Itachi.\nWhite Zetsu Clone \u2014 for the cells of Hashirama Senju, as well as to escape the fatal injury of releasing the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.[3]\nCandidates[]\nItachi Uchiha \u2014 for the Sharingan; failed due to Orochimaru being unable to defeat him.\nKimimaro \u2014 for the Shikotsumyaku; rejected due to terminal disease.\nGuren \u2014 for the Crystal Release; rejected due to being too late and loss of interest.(anime only)\nSasuke Uchiha \u2014 for the Sharingan; postponed due to being overpowered by Sasuke, then sealed away before another of his consciousnesses was released by the Evil Releasing Method.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 270\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 365, page 8\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 618, page 15", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Living_Corpse_Reincarnation"}

Each shadow has the same abilities as the real Madara, with the added advantage of being untrackable.[1] The shadows can attack targets, giving the appearance of an inexplicable force knocking them down,[3] or they can defend Madara, giving the appearance of an invisible wall around him.[4] The shadows are invulnerable to any kind of physical damage and cannot be harmed through conventional means.[2] A shadow's very formation can be used defensively, taking Madara's place mid-attack as a sort of Body Replacement Technique.[5] After a certain amount of time, a shadow will need to return to Madara's body, and he will likewise need to wait a certain amount of time before he can reform it.[6]\nAgainst most opponents, Madara's shadows give him an insurmountable advantage. But Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, after receiving Six Paths chakra, undermine some of the shadows' usual benefits: Sasuke can see them with his own Rinnegan; Naruto can sense them while using Six Paths Sage Mode;[2] Naruto can damage them using Six Paths Senjutsu.[6] Through a combination of these skills, Naruto is able to capture a shadow, preventing it from returning to Madara.[7]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Limbo:_Border_Jail"}

Conversely, he is later shown using all his chakra to perform a Purple Electricity powerful enough to induce the rain clouds he's falling through to start producing rain.\nThe anime has sometimes shown Purple Electricity being used in ways reminiscent of the Lightning Cutter, with Kakashi gathering lightning to his hand and quickly striking targets with it. He can even use it similarly to the Chidori Current, sending bolts of purple lightning all around his body in a omni-directional attack.[2]\nBoruto would learn to channel his own Purple Electricity through his blade, like Sasuke does with his Chidori Katana.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Release:_Purple_Electricity"}

Pain channelled the Preta Path through the corpse of a Kusagakure shinobi.\nThis ability is primarily defensive in nature as it is capable of absorbing chakra from an individual through physical contact. In addition to this, the Preta Path is able to absorb ninjutsu-based techniques that are pure chakra or chakra based, thereby nullifying their effect. It doesn't absorb physical attacks, like Gaara's sand, but does drain the sand's chakra.[1] This is done by forming a barrier around the user's entire body, allowing them to absorb attacks from all directions.\nAlthough the ability is able to absorb senjutsu chakra, the user is still vulnerable to the effects of turning into a stone statue from absorbing too much of it.\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used the Preta Path to absorb Killer B's chakra while he was in his Version 2 form. He then apparently used the chakra to revitalise his body to its state before it was emaciated by the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. It also restored his hair colour back from white to red, as well as the damage done to his legs. However, presumably due to loss of muscle memory, he was not able to use the legs completely.[2]\n\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Preta realm (also known as the Hungry Ghost realm) is a reincarnation based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives. The Preta are humanoid creatures which are perpetually hungry and thirsty, but are unable to satisfy themselves, living lives similar to those of hopeless addicts trying to appease their unyielding hunger. In appearance, the Preta are deathly pale, emaciated figures, which contrasts with Pain's Preta Path's hefty stature. In Hinduism Preta could also mean ghosts this also relates to the technique the Preta path uses. \n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 560, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 550, pages 17-18", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Preta_Path"}

However, by channeling her chakra into the string, Shizune can alter the trajectory of the senbon, either to concentrate them on one point, spread them over a larger area, or even change the direction of the senbon from what the device is aimed at.

When Rock Lee uses Reverse Lotus on Gaara, Gaara's Shield of Sand is unable to react fast enough to protect him. As Lee attacks Gaara, he gradually wraps Gaara with the bandages he wears, allowing him to better manoeuvre Gaara to deliver a finishing blow that sends him crashing back to the ground.[1]\nLee was taught the Reverse Lotus by his idol, Might Guy, with the understanding that it would be an attack of last resort, used only in dire circumstances. This is because opening any of the Eight Gates places a huge strain on the user's body, likely exhausting their body beyond the point of moving or even remaining conscious afterwards.[1] Ordinarily this shouldn't be an immediate problem, because the Reverse Lotus's innumerable initial attacks as well as the power of its finishing blow will likely defeat most opponents.

The seal must be placed at R\u014den's weak point, on the back of its head. If successfully applied, R\u014den's body gradually turns to smoke, which then travels to and is contained within the Kodon clan's shrine. R\u014den will only remain imprisoned there for seven years, at which time the sealing must be performed anew. Kodon can release the seal before then if they choose.\nThe back of R\u014den's head is covered with tentacles that shield the area and attack anyone who comes near, absorbing their chakra. Because of this, users require another person's help to distract R\u014den while the seal is placed. Even with help, there's a good chance that the user will die trying to use the seal, or even immediately afterwards while R\u014den's body still has form. If the seal isn't correctly applied, it will at least dull R\u014den's movements, making it easier to try using the seal again.\nThe seal can also be used to confine R\u014den within another's body; as with its typical use, the seal is placed at the back of the head. Reishi Kodon's body was not compatible with R\u014den, but his infant brother, Kina Kodon, was. Doing this doesn't carry the seven year time limit, but it does link R\u014den's chakra with Kina's: if ever the seal broke, Kina would die within ten minutes if a new seal couldn't be performed. As a curious side-effect, the seal also seemed to compel Kina to stay near the clan's shrine, preventing him and Reishi from relocating to a new home.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sealing_Technique:_R%C5%8Den_Kodon"}

The technique took three full days to complete if nine of the Akatsuki members were present. Zetsu stated that if there are fewer people to perform the technique, it would take a while longer.[3]\nTo prepare for the technique, Pain would summon the Demonic Statue, after which each member would then stand on one of its fingertips, corresponding to their specific ring finger. When performed, this technique caused the bit to fall out of the mouth of the statue. Each of the Akatsuki members would then concentrate, causing the kanji of their rings to appear on the nail of the finger they were standing on. Nine dragon-like effigies then poured from the statue's mouth, surrounded the captured host, and painfully removed the tailed beast from them. In the case of an unsealed tailed beast, the same thing happened to the beast itself, and still took as much time as if it were sealed. After the process was complete, the beast was sealed within the statue, and one of the statue's nine eyes opened. The host would die due to the removal of their tailed beast. There is a numerical order, with the Nine-Tails needing be sealed last, or the statue would shatter.[4]\nHowever, with Nagato now dead, Tobi claimed that they would need a new pawn to synchronise with the Demonic Statue in order to seal the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.[5] Though Nagato intended to use it for peace in the form of a weapon of mass destruction to keep governments in line, the technique was created for Madara Uchiha's Eye of the Moon Plan, as Obito was tasked with ensuring that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the tailed beasts would become the Ten-Tails once more.\n\nSee Also[]\nSummoning: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path\nTail Releasing Method\nTailed Beast Removal Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, Page 294\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 329, page 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 419, page 11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 353, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 450, page 9", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sealing_Technique:_Phantom_Dragons_Nine_Consuming_Seals"}

When the target is sealed, a stylised kanji for \"close\" or \"shut\" (\u9589, hei) appears in the middle of the sealing formula.\nTo successfully seal the target, one has to get them exactly inside the sealing formula. This task requires great accuracy and is very difficult to accomplish. Various methods can be used to make this easier.

He can also stop short of killing his targets, only compressing the sand enough to break their bones.[2] In this case, however, the damage is so severe that only Tsunade is skilled enough to mend the bones, and even then she anticipates only a 50% success rate.[3] In Gaara Hiden, the Sand Waterfall Funeral is stated to leave no identifiable trace of its victims, making it a useful way to fake a person's death.\nIn the anime, Shinki performs this technique using Iron Sand.[4]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sand_Waterfall_Funeral"}

Because of this, the clone can be reverted to sand at any time, most often when being attacked; as it's punched or kicked, Gaara can use the clone's sand to immediately capture the opponent's limbs. Alternatively, Gaara can use the clone as a decoy, drawing opponents to it and once they're close enough, manipulating the clone's sand against them.[1] Whereas other clones can only take so much damage before being destroyed, Gaara can reform the sand clone regardless of what happens to it.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Gaara shows the ability to make a sand clone that looks exactly like the Third Tsuchikage rather than himself.[3] In this case, the sand clone he makes exactly resembles who they're based on, not being sand-shaped lookalikes of previous depictions.\nGaara is also able to hide other materials within the sand clones to be used against opponents who attack them, such as Gold Dust against the Second Mizukage's Steaming Danger Tyranny.[4]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sand_Clone"}

The stored chakra is then released into their body, greatly amplifying the power of their techniques. The seal will permanently remain in the centre of the user's forehead, presumably so that the user can keep on benefiting from its effects.\nThis seal is also symbiotically linked to the summon Katsuyu. That is to say: the power of the techniques used by Katsuyu, is directly proportional to the reserves of the seal.[5] By releasing the power of their seals, Tsunade and Sakura were able to combine its power with the Creation Rebirth technique in order to gain access to the Ninja Art Creation Rebirth \u2014 Strength of a Hundred Technique.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Strength_of_a_Hundred_Seal"}

He then smears some of his blood on a scroll, holds the scroll in his hands as he performs the hand seals, and presses the scroll to the ground as he summons the ninken. Rather than track down Zabuza's scent, the ninken track the scent of Kakashi's blood to Zabuza.[2] When Haku later damages the scroll, the summoning is ended prematurely and the ninken disappear, thus releasing Zabuza.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning:_Earth_Release:_Tracking_Fang_Technique"}

It allows him to instantaneously shrink himself or any nonliving matter within his gaze and return it to its original size at will.\n\nOverview[]\nSukunahikona allows the user to shrink themselves and targets within the user sight, even energy and other chakra-based substances, though living beings other than the user cannot be affected. Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see, it is often mistaken for teleportation. It cannot be used on oneself if they are physically paralysed. Daikokuten can be used to store shrunken objects within a dimension where time doesn't flow, allowing them to maintain their condition.\nIsshiki \u014ctsutsuki utilised this jutsu while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya to enter the body of Jigen, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before taking over his brain.\nIsshiki employs this technique in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage. He also uses it to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use K\u0101ma's absorption while shrunk himself.

This extra chakra will allow the user to utilise high level element ninjutsu. It also allows the user to use elemental techniques that they wouldn't be able to master normally. The chakra is not infinite, and must be replenished over time. Furthermore, only one type of elemental chakra can be injected into the person at a time, as Neji noted that Shizuku was seen with a completely different element from the previous encounter.\nThe person injected with these snakes can also force the snake out, and drink the chakra directly, vastly increasing their chakra and power, as well as inducing a body-mutating transformation (in Gitai's case, he became an Asura-like entity, with three faces, six-arms and a tail), but results in their body being highly unstable, which, if struck with sufficient force, can result in the body exploding.\nThe dark chakra snakes can also be used against the opponents. By injecting them with the same chakra, it can either paralyse or kill without leaving a mark.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Strengthening_Prescription:_Chakra_Injection"}

After completing the necessary hand signs, the scrolls rise up and spin around each other cloaked in smoke shaped like a dragon. When the smoke disperses, Tenten jumps in between the scrolls and starts to unseal and throw weapons at her opponent in quick succession. If her opponent deflects or dodges the attack, she can use the wire strings attached to the weapons to recover them for another attack.\nDuring the time-skip, Tenten made some improvements to this technique. She no longer has to waste her time grabbing and throwing the weapons, as she can send them flying with just a movement of her hand. As such, she can unseal more weapons at a time, allowing her to attack at a much faster rate. She also adds explosive tags to her kunai to make her attacks more lethal.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Rising_Dragons"}

In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her two sons, she imparted her will upon the God Tree and  \u2014 along with all the people tethered to it \u2014  created what then became the Ten-Tails.[1] Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.\nImmediately prior to being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival. To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as Black Zetsu, which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.[2][3] Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.[4] Once the remnants of her chakra were finally reunited, Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha. It was also capable of manipulating the husk of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of White Zetsu from it.\n\nMadara Uchiha[]\nMadara Uchiha was also capable of using this ability. Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan. \nMadara was actually able to impart his will into the black rod that emerged from the flowering tree he was attached to in his old age. Revealing it to Obito, Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the Six Paths Technique.[5]\nOn a later occasion, following his resurrection, Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.[6] This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his chakra, as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.[7]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 681, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 678, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 681, page 8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 656, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 606, pages 15-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 636, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 637", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Materialisation"}

Yachihoko is a powerful Genjutsu, and works by erasing the memories of any individual it targets, creating puppets that Nanashi is able to manipulate. The Genjutsu itself is powerful enough that even a perfect Jinch\u016briki, such as Naruto Uzumaki, was unable to have it dispelled by his Tailed Beast, Kurama.\nYachihoko also allows for the manipulation of chakra from to and from the user via those marked with the Engraved Tsukuyomi blemish. Merz was able to absorb the chakra of a vast portion of the Shinobi World using Yachihoko. Additionally, Nanashi could transfer chakra this way, giving it to Boruto on two occasions to allow him to fight.\n\nInfluence[]\nLike other Mangeky\u014d Sharingan techniques, Yachihoko takes its name from ancient Japanese myth and the Shint\u014d religion.

During the forest's formation, the user can have the branch restrain any target(s) that tries to attack the user before the formation of the forest is complete. The pollen produced by these flowers is then released into the atmosphere and when inhaled, renders any afflicted target unconscious. The user can also control where the pollen spreads so it does not affect them nor their comrades. The pollen is also capable of penetrating Susanoo's defences.\nWith enough willpower, it is possible to regain consciousness, however, in order to counter the technique fully, either the trees themselves must be destroyed completely or the target must continue to remain elevated above the dispersed pollen.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 297", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Wood_Release:_Advent_of_a_World_of_Flowering_Trees"}

Regardless of the natural atmosphere around him, he could manifest many different weather effects, effectively turning them into powerful attacks or defences. It should be noted that his area of effect is not limited to outside, as he is able to isolate his abilities to relatively closed off areas, while within them. Yota has shown to have a great level of control over the range and direction of his ability, and could use them simultaneously if need be.\nThe following effects have been shown:\n\nRain: Once manifested, it could rain softly or fiercely, and could even be directed towards a single person. The rain itself seems to have an unusual effects on his opponents, as it is able to drain them of their chakra and vitality, while seemingly making them sad as well. Once produced in terms of offence and defence, he could summon varying sizes of very powerful, pressurised, water trenches to either block incoming attacks, restrain, or crush his opponents. He could even create huge water bubbles that attacks opponents with concussive force. Coming from many different directions, each of his attacks could manifest from anywhere within his vicinity, seemingly coming from thin air.\nSnow: Showing only the offensive capabilities, Yota is able to turn a simple snowfall into a powerful blizzard, enabling him to near instantly freeze everything around him, including people.\nLightning: Yota can produce large bolts of purple lightning. The lightning could be directed from anywhere, to anywhere the enemy is, and in rapid succession. It was fast enough to keep up with Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru. Should the lighting ever connect, it is powerful enough to instantly kill the target. However, if Yota wills it, the lightning can completely obliterate the target, even if it is the latter himself.\nWind: Yota is able to fully manipulate the direction and intensity of wind by whistling. He could summon anything from a concentrated tornado, to several whirlwinds. Each of these attacks have the offensive capabilities to slash and wound the intended target. It was powerful enough to cut, and catch off guard, Naruto Uzumaki, despite being in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.\nSunlight: Yota could also make the sun shine brightly. Although it hasn't been used offensively or defensively, it has shown to cause flowers to bloom quickly around him.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Weather_Manipulation"}

To do this, the user has to be emitting a constant stream of chakra from the bottom of their feet and using the repellent force to walk across the water's surface. This technique is more difficult to master than the Tree Climbing Practice, because the amount of chakra that needs to be emitted changes constantly.\nIt has also been shown that one can use their chakra to \"skate\" across the water surface, like an ice skater, instead of just walking or running. As Jiraiya noted, the more one trains this technique, the more they reach a state where they stand on water without even noticing it or basically even trying.[1] Furthermore, this technique allows its users to walk on sticky surfaces without being affected.[2]\nIt doesn't have to just be at the feet. A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the water's surface. If they were submerged, they can climb atop the water as if they were climbing out of a pool.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 326, page 8", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Surface_Walking_Practice"}

Users control how long the wall lasts as well as how much water it's made with. Because the water is clear, the wall doesn't obstruct the user's vision, allowing them to make their next move uninhibited.[1] The wall's initial formation, if timed correctly, can be used to fend off opponents, flinging them away as the wall rises.[3] In the anime, the water can also be gathered midair, and dispersed in all directions as a form of fire-fighting,[4] or shot from one's hand.[5]\nIn Sasuke Shinden, Sasuke Uchiha creates the Water Formation Wall around his allies rather than around himself, providing them a shield while he carries out other tasks.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Release:_Water_Formation_Wall"}

Neji Hy\u016bga was able to free himself by simultaneously releasing chakra from all of his tenketsu, destroying the prison.[5] In Akatsuki Hiden, Kisame Hoshigaki escaped by increasing the volume of water within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\nIn order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it. For this reason, water clones can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison,[6] or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act. In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.[4] In the anime, this contact is shown to not be necessary, allowing users to trap targets from a distance,[7] and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.[8]\nThe water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes. It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.[9] Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Prison_Technique"}

Because he acts as the centre of the dome of water, the dome alters its position in order to reflect the direction of his movements, making it difficult for his target to escape as long as he continues his pursuit.\nFusing with Samehada provides Kisame a tremendous advantage. This fused form grants him the ability to breathe underwater while his target continues to drown as they attempt to futilely escape the large body of water. This technique is extremely effective in one on one fights, but the user would probably not be able to contain two enemies fleeing in opposite directions.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 262", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Prison_Shark_Dance_Technique"}

Unlike the standard Clone Technique, these water clones are physically real, allowing them to interact with others and even perform the same jutsu as the user. Although a single water clone can be quite challenging to a standard genin,[1] water clones only have about a tenth of their user's strength. When a water clone is sufficiently damaged, it will revert back into water.[3] In the anime, the clones can alternatively disperse into a mist that act as a smokescreen to briefly covers the area.[4]\nWater clones cannot travel too far from their user's location, meaning that running away is a viable option against them.[5] This aside, water clones are useful as support and diversions.[1] The clones can even be used as mobile bodies of water, through which the user can perform their other water-based jutsu; when this is done, the user will need to perform the necessary hand seals.[6]\n\nSee Also[]\nBubble Clone Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 224\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 142, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 23, page 3\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 165\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 14, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 257, pages 15-16", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Clone_Technique"}

If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall. The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics.

Users will gain the attributes and physical features of whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's fangs.[2][3] To be able to assume so many different forms makes this technique invaluable for not just combat, but intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics as well.[1] In Sasuke Shinden, some transformations are shown to take some getting used to, such as if the assumed form has a different height than the user or if the assumed form wears clothes that the user isn't accustomed to.\nBeing able to use the Transformation Technique does not necessarily mean one can use it well. Ideally, the user's transformation should be indistinguishable from the original, so that if they were placed together they could not be told apart. Inexperienced users, particularly Academy students, will often have obvious discrepancies in their transformations, making them useless for deception.[1] Even practised users, though their transformations may lack any serious flaws, can overlook small details of whoever they're impersonating (such as minor scrapes or blemishes), thus enabling careful observers to expose them as impostors. Even if a transformation is a perfect likeness, users can still inadvertently reveal themselves if they don't act the same way as their subject.[4] Users can also be identified as fakes if their scent is wrong.[5]\nWhen a transformed user has been found out and attacked, they ordinarily allow the transformation to dispel. Some users may maintain the transformation in a final attempt to keep their cover, only dispelling the transformation once this effort fails.[4] Still other users may, when they seem to be dispelling the transformation, actually take another transformation altogether, confusing opponents as to their true identity. Seemingly the only way to reliably find out if somebody is using the Transformation Technique is to knock them unconscious, which will cause the transformation to dissolve.[6]\nTsunade uses the Transformation Technique to constantly appear several decades younger, keeping it active regardless of where she is or what she's doing. She only reverts to her original form when she no longer has the chakra to maintain her transformation.[7] In the anime, Kager\u014d also keeps her Transformation Technique active for long periods of time, taking the form of a buck-toothed, hunchbacked man.[8] In Akatsuki Hiden, the citizens of Shangri-la use the Transformation Technique at all times in a concerted effort to make new lives for themselves; their transformations only dispel when they die.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Transformation_Technique"}

The jinch\u016briki will use the raw chakra of the their Tailed Beast to form arms, which they can freely manipulate to attack their foes, able to strike an opponent faster than even a Sharingan user can react to.[2] The chakra arms' hands are clawed while the rest of the arm seems to lack any kind of joint, thus allowing them to have flexible movements that will generally be impossible for normal arms. The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case). Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the fourth tail up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.[3] Killer B has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his Lightning Release: Lariat technique.[4]\nIn his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale. These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.[5] In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.[6] After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.[7] Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the Tailed Beast Rasengan since he was advised by the Eight-Tails against the use of shadow clones in this form.[8] Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to create several at once to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to pull enemies into the attack, and even create tiny ones around his finger. The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation,[9] such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the Third Raikage.

The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice. The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal. The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.[1]\nJiraiya can control the oesophagus, causing it to expand, contract, or grow in whatever direction he wishes. When first used, Jiraiya claims that no one has ever escaped from this technique. Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki manage to escape when Itachi burns through the oesophagus using Amaterasu. This surprises Jiraiya, as the oesophagus is fire-resistant due to the toad's ability to breathe fire.[2]\nIn the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique. This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect. Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.[3]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning:_Toad_Mouth_Bind"}

The greatest advantage of this technique is that the time between taking out a ninja tool, taking the right stance and actually throwing it is greatly reduced.

His original idea is to create an Earth-Style Wall to reach that altitude, but he doesn't believe he would have enough chakra to make it tall enough. For this reason he recruits Yamato to assist him. They practice all night to synchronise Kakashi's Earth Release with Yamato's Wood Release, finding a configuration that is structurally sound but that also will reach the intended elevation within the one hour they'll be allotted.\nThe Spiralling Tower originally works as intended, with Kakashi's earth pillar and Yamato's wood pillar entwining in order to fortify each other as they grow into the sky. But a rainstorm begins shortly after they start, forcing Kakashi to spend additional chakra to reinforce the earth pillar against the rain and wind. The task eventually becomes too much for him and he loses sync with Yamato, briefly halting the tower's growth and potentially risking its destruction. Gaara and Kurotsuchi, whose assistance Kakashi requested the night before, arrive in time to assist, stabilising the tower that has been created so far and adding a sand pillar from Gaara and a second earth pillar from Kurotsuchi to its continued entwining growth.\nThe Spiralling Tower ends up being a success, with the three-man team that was ascending it reaching their destination in time. At the conclusion of the three's mission, an impact at the peak topples the tower and causes debris to start falling on Konoha. Gaara attempts to use his sand to shield the village, but he has no additional chakra to do so. A separate team of six ninja assembled specifically to deal with this potential debris begins to repel the initial chunks of the tower, but they are quickly overwhelmed. It is ultimately the Seventh Hokage who destroys the majority of the debris, saving the village.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Spiralling_Tower_Technique"}

Because of how much power is put into each arrow, they travel incredibly quickly, too fast to see.[1] On impact, the arrows pierce cleanly through targets and obstacles alike and can crater the ground,[3] to the point that it is described as a \"one hit kill\". By activating his cursed seal's second level, Kid\u014dmaru gains a third eye which further increases his accuracy, allowing him to hit his target's vital spots from hundreds of metres away.[1]\nWhen fighting Neji Hy\u016bga, Kid\u014dmaru initially uses a standard arrow without any special properties. By surrounding the area with his chakra, Neji is able to sense to arrow in time to avoid fatal injury.[3] To account for this, Kid\u014dmaru attaches one of his usual spider threads to the arrow, allowing him to control its trajectory from up to fifty metres and thus improve its accuracy.[1] Neji takes shelter behind a tree to throw the arrow off course. To account for this, Kid\u014dmaru modifies the arrowhead into a drill, which will allow it to pierce through the tree if Neji tries that again.[3] The combination of the new arrow and the guiding thread is enough to successfully strike Neji, which Neji uses as an opportunity to locate and kill Kid\u014dmaru.[4] In the anime, after being reincarnated, Kid\u014dmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Spider_War_Bow:_Terrible_Split"}

It is very malleable when first created, but once it makes contact with the air it hardens rapidly, becoming as strong as steel. For this reason, if he intends to shape the substance into a particular form, he should do so before it's left his body, such as by chewing it into sharp projectiles that he extracts from his mouth. Alternatively, he can carefully shape it as he spits it out, as he does with the Spider War Bow: Terrible Split. These golden weapons are the core of Kid\u014dmaru's offensive tactics, typically used for long-range attacks.[1] A property of the Spider Sticky Gold is that it is fortified against chakra, making techniques such as Gentle Fist unable to penetrate it.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 T\u014d no Sho, page 217\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 264", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Spider_Sticky_Gold"}

It was utilised by the reincarnated Sound Four releasing their hatred within their cursed seals.\n\nOverview[]\nThe seal activates around the user, trapping anyone within its range. The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier. Sensor ninja and even the Byakugan cannot sense and see through this technique respectively. The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops. To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra. Inoichi Yamanaka likens this to a genjutsu cancel.\nInside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know. Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end. As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die. However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can sense ill will can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Space%E2%80%93Time_Technique_Formula:_Underworld_Turnover"}

Jirobo stated that utilising the second stage of the Cursed Seal makes them ten times more powerful than before.[1] However, Sakon comments that after using their cursed seal's second level and coming out of it, they lose a lot of energy.\nLater, in Part II of the anime, it was revealed that Orochimaru enhanced the power of their cursed seals, giving them the ability to use the Space\u2013Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover, a technique capable of trapping the souls of the user and the victim within an untraceable barrier, to fight with little to no interference. The technique however, would result in the user's death. In the cases of the Sound Four, who were reincarnated, they were able to survive the usage of this technique, though their souls returned to the Pure Land when the barrier was broken.\n\nForms[]\nJir\u014db\u014d[]\nJir\u014db\u014d's cursed seal; first level.Jir\u014db\u014d's cursed seal; second level.1/2\nJir\u014db\u014d's cursed seal is the only one not seen before it is activated. However, the pattern that spreads during its first state are like chains of triangular arrows. When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns maroon, his hair grows longer, and he also grows warts on his forehead and shoulders. He most greatly resembles an ogre in this form. He claims his strength increases ten times, to the point where he can single-handedly lift a gigantic Ch\u014dji Akimichi.\n\n\nKid\u014dmaru[]\n    Kid\u014dmaru's cursed seal.  \nKidomaru's cursed seal; first level.Kidomaru's cursed seal; second level.1/2\nKid\u014dmaru's cursed seal, seen only in the anime, is formed like a hook (placed with the sharp end down) with two tags at the end of the upper part. When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns deep red, his hair grows longer and turns a light greyish colour, and he grows horns on his forehead and his elbows. He becomes more spider-like, almost oni-like in appearance in this form. By opening the third eye on his forehead, his accuracy increases to the point of pinpointing Neji Hy\u016bga\u2019s Byakugan blind spot from a distance of over 50 metres. This increase in strength and precision allowed him to use the destructive archery technique, Spider War Bow: Terrible Split.\n\n\nSakon and Ukon[]\n     Sakon and Ukon's cursed seal.  \nSakon and Ukons' cursed seal; first level.Sakon and Ukons' cursed seal; second level.1/2\nSakon and Ukon both have the same type of cursed seal, which consists of three circular dots placed like a triangular shape on their foreheads. When the second level of their seals are active, they resemble goblins with red skin, longer hair, a single horn (on opposite sides for each brother), and can grow black armour from their bodies (from the side where they separate). They can also extend their fusing abilities to someone other than each other, and tear their opponents apart on a cellular level.\n\n\nTayuya[]\n     Tayuya's cursed seal.  \nTayuya's cursed seal; first level.Tayuya's cursed seal; second level.1/2\nTayuya's cursed seal consists of three hooks, similar to a triskelion on the back of her neck. When the second level of her seal is active, her hair grows longer, she grows five oddly-placed horns on her head, slightly resembling a crown, and her skin turns dark brown. The horns grow when she exerts herself. Her strength increases, to the point of breaking free of the Shadow Imitation Technique.\n\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 114", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Four%27s_Cursed_Seals"}

The rods strike the ground at six points in his surroundings, and once the necessary hand seals are performed, they serve as the origin points for a gigantic red barrier.[2]\nLike its smaller counterpart, the barrier is highly malleable, being capable of withstanding the explosion of four enormous Tailed Beast Balls derived from the power of the Ten-Tails by dispersing their force upwards and into the sky.[3] However, as with similar techniques, the barrier can still be bypassed through the use of space\u2013time ninjutsu such as the Flying Thunder God Technique.[4] The barrier's creator can also deactivate it at will, as well as apparently reactivate it at a later time if necessary.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Six_Red_Yang_Formation"}

Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.[2] Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\nThe Deva Path (\u5929\u9053, Tend\u014d), which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\nThe Asura Path (\u4fee\u7f85\u9053, Shurad\u014d), which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\nThe Human Path (\u4eba\u9593\u9053, Ningend\u014d), which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\nThe Animal Path (\u755c\u751f\u9053, Chikush\u014dd\u014d), which allows the user to summon a wide variety of creatures.\nThe Preta Path (\u9913\u9b3c\u9053, Gakid\u014d), which is capable of absorbing all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.\nThe Naraka Path (\u5730\u7344\u9053, Jigokud\u014d), through which the user can call upon the King of Hell.\nThe Outer Path (\u5916\u9053, Ged\u014d), with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\nNagato, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of black receivers. These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations. The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.[2] Obito Uchiha would later make use of this method to create his own Six Paths of Pain, this time using six former jinch\u016briki that were reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi.[3]\nAs the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk. However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale Shinra Tensei,[4] or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of Chibaku Tensei.[5] In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.[6]\n\nInfluences[]\nThe Six Paths share their names with the six realms of reincarnation in Buddhism: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\nThe Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term T\u012brthika, refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the Naid\u014d (\u5185\u9053, literally meaning: Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Six_Paths_Technique"}

It can also be obtained by becoming the jinch\u016briki of the Ten-Tails, as taking in the power of the nine tailed beasts is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nSix Paths Senjutsu is suggested to have a connection with the pattern that appears on the user's back when it is used, consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama, which resembles the pattern on the back of Hagoromo's robe.[1] The pattern that appeared on Obito Uchiha's back differed slightly from that of other known users, with the Rinnegan-like marking itself being shaped into a magatama.[4]\nAs a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to Sage Mode, though the user's sensing capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of Limbo.[5] They also gain a complete comprehension of chakra, including the ability to use all five basic nature transformations and make perfect use of Yin\u2013Yang Release,[6] as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.[7] When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of Truth-Seeking Balls.[8]\n\n    Obito's unique pattern.  \nAs the Ten-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Obito and Madara Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general. The two were entirely immune to the effects of ninjutsu, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and taijutsu,[9] though techniques utilising Six Paths Power could also damage them.[10] They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds,[11] with Madara even claiming to be immortal.[12] Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only techniques of the highest level have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by Daytime Tiger without harm.[13] Obito was capable of producing chakra arms from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the Four Red Yang Formation with ease.[14] Despite not previously possessing the kekkei genkai, Madara was able to use a Storm Release technique,[15] which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.[16]\nNaruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his Six Paths Sage Mode, a form which he received from Hagoromo.[7] When Naruto used this mode in conjunction with his chakra cloak during the Fourth Shinobi World War, he wore a unique shroud with the pattern associated with Six Paths Senjutsu on its back.[1] According to Sasuke Uchiha, the Truth-Seeking Balls Naruto used in this form utilised what he called \"Six Paths Sage Chakra\" (\u516d\u9053\u306e\u4ed9\u4eba\u30c1\u30e3\u30af\u30e9, Rikud\u014d no Sennin Chakura), which allowed them to damage Madara's shadow.[17]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Six_Paths_Senjutsu"}

Directly after obtaining Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki's power, Naruto's eyes are yellow[3] and later orange with the various chakra modes he uses after the war, just like his previous ones before meeting Hagoromo.[4] This mode increases the user's physical parameters well above that of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode,[1] as Naruto was able to kick away Truth-Seeking Balls before entering the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode with this power.[2] As a heightened state of Sage Mode, Naruto's jutsu are augmented with larger amounts of natural energy to make them stronger. With the power he received from Hagoromo, Naruto gains a masterful grasp of chakra, control over all things in nature, and the ability to comprehend all universal things.[1] His sensing ability also rises to the point where he can sense and thus react to the invisible shadows in the world of Limbo.[5]\nWhen Naruto uses his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with his Six Paths Sage Mode, he can push his abilities even further, such as being able to levitate,[1][6] becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki off guard[7] and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.[8]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Six_Paths_Sage_Mode"}

The first three seals will light the seal up, allow the user to levitate, and create a barrier. The barrier will repel things from the outside, although M\u014dry\u014d managed to enter at the cost of the life of his host, Yomi. Also, the spheres inside the circle will begin to revolve around the circle.\nThe next nine seals will cause the gate-like seal leading to M\u014dry\u014d's body to rise above the ground. This gate seems to be laid on its back.\nThe final six seals will release the seal on M\u014dry\u014d's body, and it becomes accesible (to M\u014dry\u014d). After reclaiming his body, M\u014dry\u014d managed to break the barrier around the seal, as he mentions Yomi did not have the ability to do so.\nThe true effect of the sealing is that the user and the target being sealed will merge into one being. So that neither parties can utilise their chakra, the two minds are combined into one. Then one must absorb the other, as M\u014dry\u014d did with Miroku (this gave to the rise of M\u014dry\u014d in the first place, who was born from the darkness inside the hearts of people), and neither the user nor target can leave the shrine until this happens. M\u014dry\u014d could not do the same with Shion due to the bell which contained the stone where Miroku sealed all of her powers into. Sacrifice is not really necessary, as the movie suggests that Miroku used this technique twice to seal M\u014dry\u014d's body on opposite regions. Once completed, the tomb will store the victim for eternity.\nShion, however, knew nothing about this, instead believing the sealing technique will simply seal the demon away.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine_Seal"}

Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the sands and used them to protect him.[2] Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara. After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.[3] The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.[4] It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.[5]\nThe Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of. When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it. Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.[2] The Shield of Sand is automatic, requiring nothing from Gaara to use and thus meaning it can operate indefinitely.[6] Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's chakra, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.[7] Some, such as Rock Lee and Sasuke Uchiha, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.[8][9] The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.[10]\nThe Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from kunai,[2] exploding tags,[3] Senbon Shower,[11] taijutsu,[10] Shikotsumyaku,[12] Explosive Clay,[7] and Amaterasu,[13] to name only a few. The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact. On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.[12] Only incredibly fast, piercing attacks, notably the Chidori, have been shown to actually break through the Shield of Sand and injure Gaara.[14]\n\n    Karura manifesting as the shield.  \nEven though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses. He can fully surround himself with the shield, eliminating the chance of it being bypassed through sheer speed. While he does this, he relies on his Third Eye to see what's going on outside,[15] and then forms spikes from the shield to keep approaching enemies away. In Part I, Gaara usually enters this sphere of sand while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode.[14] In Gaara Hiden, Gaara uses his Magnet Release to mix \"sparkling metal particles\" into the Shield of Sand, fortifying it against attacks that would otherwise penetrate it. Even Karura's will sometimes influences the Shield of Sand, shaping it into her likeness as it protects Gaara to remind him of her.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_of_Sand"}

This causes the sacrifice to become the individual's identical copy, complete with perfect imitations of the original's kekkei genkai (such as the Sharingan) and unique weapons (such as Samehada). The original controls their copy remotely, thus making the copy's movements and knowledge indistinguishable as well. But the copy is limited by how much of the original's chakra they are given, so particularly chakra-taxing jutsu cannot be used. Once the chakra from the original runs out, the sacrifice reverts to their own appearance and they die.[1]\nPain uses the Shapeshifting Technique to make Y\u016bra into a copy of Itachi Uchiha and Mukade into a copy of Kisame Hoshigaki. The copies are given 30% of their original's chakra and are used to delay Team Kakashi and Team Guy.[2] Despite the copies supposedly being exactly the same as their original, Kakashi Hatake notices something different about the copy of Itachi, though he doesn't realise why until after the Shapeshifting Technique has ended.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Sha no Sho, page 268\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 255, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 260, page 15", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shapeshifting_Technique"}

The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately. They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads. Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\nThis technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down. This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support. After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Sewing_Technique"}

The goal is for targets to focus their attention on whichever of the two shuriken is on top, not noticing the second shuriken travelling below it. Ideally, targets will dodge the upper shuriken in such a way that they are left unable to dodge the second. If targets do at any point realise there's a second shuriken, the technique is rendered ineffective.[1]\nNaruto Uzumaki sometimes disguises himself or his shadow clones as shuriken, which either he or an ally will throw as part of the Shadow Shuriken Technique. That way, in the event that targets dodge both shuriken, the shadow clone will be well-positioned for an attack.[2] Additionally, this technique does not require a literal shuriken: the same principles can be applied to the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken.[3][4]\n\nSee Also[]\nShadow Senbon\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 169\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 14, pages 16-18\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 441, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 442, page 5", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Shuriken_Technique"}

The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it. But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range;[2] Shikamaru Nara frequently uses flash bombs, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets'.[3] Shikamaru Hiden clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\nOnce a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk. The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.[4] Nara tend to wear their shuriken holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.[5] Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps[6] or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.[7] At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.[8]\nKeeping a target restrained requires a great deal of chakra, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.[9] With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.[10] If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control. When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the Shadow\u2013Neck Binding Technique or Shadow Sewing Technique.[11][12]\nThe Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the \"Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique\" (\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u79d8\u4f1d\u30fb\u5f71\u7e1b\u308a\u306e\u8853, Konoha Hiden: Kageshibari no Jutsu, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique), which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.[13] The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after Orochimaru defected from Konohagakure, as his Otogakure invaders did not know about it prior to the Konoha Crush.[14] Shikaku Nara still uses the old name sometimes.[13] Young Nara are initially only taught the Shadow Bind, with the Shadow Imitation not being learned until later; in the anime, being able to use the Shadow Imitation is considered a rite of passage within the Nara clan.[15]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Imitation_Technique"}

By using these weapons to pierce the enemies' shadows, they are paralysed in place. To pierce the shadow, it is necessary to avoid the target just barely \u2014 Shikamaru added fake explosive tags when he used them against Kakuzu and Hidan to help with that. Since it is more difficult for the enemy to notice it, this ninjutsu compensates for the weak point of the similar Shadow Imitation Technique, being its limited effective range. It is unknown for how long this jutsu can keep its targets paralysed, however it can be disrupted simply by the removal of the blade or by the disappearance of the opponent's shadow.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 232", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Imitation_Shuriken_Technique"}

This allows the host to move freely all the while the Nara's shadow is still attached to their own. Through the shadow, the Nara is able to sense when their combined shadow comes into contact with the target's, basically using the latter's own shadow as an intermediary to link up other shadows in proximity, and they can then bind them with the Shadow Imitation Technique.\nThis technique allows for the Nara to bind multiple targets on a battlefield all while not directly engaging in combat, adding an element of surprise to their companion's attacks.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 315", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Imitation_Shadow_Bind_Technique"}

The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at least j\u014dnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.[4] The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique \u2013 which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens \u2013 is unsafe to the point of being forbidden. Naruto Uzumaki is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails, he can create hundreds of clones without worry.[5]\n\n    Shadow clones' identical chakra pathway systems, seen with a Byakugan.  \nUnlike the basic Clone Technique, shadow clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created,[6] but certain chakra constructs[7] and complicated technology won't be duplicated.[8] Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by d\u014djutsu;[4][9][10] Madara Uchiha can identify shadow clones using his Rinnegan.[11]\nOnce created, shadow clones can serve a number of purposes. They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity.[12] If enough shadow clones are created, they can simply overwhelm an opponent, pinning them down or attacking from multiple directions.[6] Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone[13] or being sent to carry out tasks while the user is busy. Shadow clones possess all the same memories as the user, and so will react to unforeseen obstacles just as the user would in the same circumstances. Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other jutsu, including making more shadow clones.[14]\nShadow clones usually disperse once they are struck hard enough, but they have been shown capable of enduring injuries for a time.[15] When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user. Once dispersed, the clone's experiences and remaining chakra are transferred back to the user.[16] The shared experiences make shadow clones useful for intelligence gathering: a shadow clone can be sent into hostile territory, gather information without endangering the user, and disperse when finished, thus transferring what they've learned.[17] Alternatively, shadow clones can recon an area, dispersing when they've found what they're looking for in order to let the user know the target's location.[18]\n\n     Naruto using shadow clones to accelerate his nature transformation training.  \nKakashi Hatake discovered that shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses. By using hundreds of clones, training that would usually take weeks or months can be completed within a few hours.[19] But because of how much chakra it takes to create just one shadow clone, and because the training itself will likely be arduous even without shadow clones, only Naruto can train in this way.[20] Naruto is indeed able to make effective use of this shortcut, but the combined experiences come with combined mental fatigue, requiring that he take regular breaks.[21]\nAlthough they are separate, shadow clones maintain small links between themselves and their original, intended to allow the user to reestablish control when needed. Users can exploit this link to network their clones, causing changes in their own chakra to extend to all the others.[3] In certain cases, this link can work against the user, such as when pain caused by the Nine-Tails' chakra was felt by all of Naruto's shadow clones.[22] While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.[23][24] In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is consciously aware of what all his shadow clones around Konohagakure are doing. Although this allows him to have multiple conversations simultaneously, he has difficulty focusing on any one thing and the original Naruto becomes increasingly strained the longer the shadow clones are active; he drinks coffee and energy supplements in order to remain alert, but as soon as his concentration falters his shadow clones will all disperse.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique"}

Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their chakra through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to fire crescents of chakra whenever the blade is swung. This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.\nThe samurai have also shown the ability to use shape transformation during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, spiked shafts and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of wakizashi, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.\nThis transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant buzzsaws and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.[1]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Samurai_Sabre_Technique"}

After forming the necessary hand seals, the user expels a dragon-like entity from their mouth that carries an orb in its left front claw. As the dragon tightly coils itself around the orb, it releases both blinding light and deafening sound by making the air oscillate. This alone greatly hinders those in the vicinity but, due to the intensity of the resulting vibrations, paralysing pain is also induced. Thus, the technique both briefly inhibits the opponent's senses, as well as techniques that require their active concentration.\nAccording to Kabuto, only he is capable of functioning normally whilst this technique is in effect, thanks to the properties of his Sage Mode and his adopted abilities. Due to his snake characteristics, Kabuto can close the cornea of his eyes to completely block the harmful light, whilst instead relying upon the enhanced perception of his other senses to compensate for his obstructed vision.

Naruto and eight of his shadow clones each form a Rasenshuriken that's been imbued with the unique chakra of a different tailed beast; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki would be weak to.[1] When the nine thrown Rasenshuriken strike Kaguya, multiple large explosions are created. Although Kaguya herself is not noticeably hurt by the attack, the tailed beasts' chakra contained within the Rasenshuriken resonates with the tailed beasts' chakra within Kaguya, preventing her from maintaining her humanoid form.[2] Jin no Sho describes this as, \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time.\"[1]\nThe exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:\n\nThe Rasenshuriken for Shukaku has a similar appearance to the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which uses magnetized sand.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Matatabi appears to consist of the same blue fire that Matatabi's body is composed of.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Isobu is seemingly formed out of water.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Son Gok\u016b appears to be the Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Koku\u014d seems to be emitting steam, which Koku\u014d's jinch\u016briki have been shown to be able to produce.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Saiken resembles a bubbly gas. In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for Wisdom Wolf Decay. In the anime, it appears more analogous to the Soap Bubble Ninjutsu used by Saiken's jinch\u016briki.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Ch\u014dmei has no obvious source in either the manga or anime. Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 identifies it as being composed of Scale Powder.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Gy\u016bki is seemingly made of ink, which Gy\u016bki's jinch\u016briki have been shown to be able to produce.\nThe Rasenshuriken for Kurama appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sage_Art:_Super_Tailed_Beast_Rasenshuriken"}

But whereas the regular Summoning Technique functions identically from one use to the next, the Reverse Summoning Technique has had two distinct uses seen in the series:\n\nWith the standard Summoning Technique, a shinobi summons an animal that they've signed a contract with to their location.[2] The Reverse Summoning Technique does the opposite, allowing an animal to summon a shinobi that has signed a contract with its species to its location.[3] Whereas summons performed by shinobi have some sort of time limit, after which the animal will automatically return to its home,[4] summons performed by animals have no known time limit, as Naruto Uzumaki remains at Mount My\u014dboku for several days after he's been reverse summoned there. Animals can return the shinobi to where they were summoned from when they choose,[5] potentially overlapping with the Reverse Summoning Technique's second form of usage.\nAfter a shinobi has summoned an animal, they can use the Reverse Summoning Technique to transport the animal to another location. The shinobi and/or their allies can accompany the animal when this is done, such as by riding in its mouth, giving the shinobi a method of quickly travelling long distances[6] or escaping confinement.[7]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Reverse_Summoning_Technique"}

Dosu can direct the sound waves based on how he moves his arm,[2] or he can guide them at a specific target using his chakra; because it's sound, it can't be blocked. The sound damages his target's semicircular canals, throwing them off balance so that they can't stand, move, or fight.[1] Additional side-effects include bleeding ears, distorted vision, and vomiting.[2]\nCh\u014dji Akimichi attempts to defend himself from this technique by tucking his head into his expanded body, effectively plugging his ears. This ends up making things easier for Dosu: because most of the body is composed of water - which is a naturally good conductor of sound - Dosu is able to further amplify the sound waves by emitting them directly into Ch\u014dji's body, assailing his hiding ears.[3] Dosu does something similar against obstacles, focusing the sound waves against them through physical contact in order to decimate them.[4][5]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 179\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 53\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 87\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 51\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 52", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Resonating_Echo_Drill"}

A few years prior to the events of Sasuke Retsuden, Zans\u016bru, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique. However, because he was not a ninja, he recruited Jiji to perform it on his behalf. A few decades prior to this, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama Senju's Impure World Reincarnation.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique is similar to the Impure World Reincarnation in many ways, to the point that Sasuke Uchiha initially believes they are the same. Zans\u016bru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant. Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates dinosaurs (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, Margo, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead. Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a chicken, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs. Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.\nThe dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive. In the novel, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity. Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days. Unlike the humans reincarnated with the Impure World Reincarnation, who don't seem fazed by injuries, the dinosaurs reincarnated with this technique still feel pain. Yet because they can't die, they must suffer through any injuries that would ordinarily kill them until their body is healed. This detail draws empathy from Sasuke, prompting him to avoid injuring the dinosaurs when possible: he believes Amaterasu could be used to \"kill\" the dinosaurs, burning them with undying flames and rendering them incapacitated, but decides not to try it so as not to subject them to the prolonged pain that would cause. However in the anime adaptation this jutsu lacks most of the immortality advantages. The reincarnated beings bleed and can be killed with a serious enough damage.\nHow the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation. The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard genjutsu. Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, Men\u014d, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Men\u014d wants. This momentarily allows him to establish control over Men\u014d with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his chakra into Men\u014d's body to overwrite Jiji's control.\nHaving control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages. Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for. Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Men\u014d, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra. Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zans\u016bru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated. Furthermore, new commands will immediately override previous commands regardless of potential consequences; Zans\u016bru at one point commands a flying dinosaur to let him ride it, but later gives the same dinosaur a new command unrelated to being ridden, causing Zans\u016bru to fall off and die upon impact with the ground. If and when the non-user dies, any commands they gave are rescinded and the original user's most recent commands take effect again.\nTo release this technique, the user performs the same hand seals that are used to initiate it in the first place, thus freeing the souls (even those under the control of another) from their reincarnated bodies. The souls do not immediately return to the afterlife, instead lingering in their bodies for a few moments; this brief delay gives Sasuke and Men\u014d a chance to exchange farewells. One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world. Once the souls do finally depart, their body disintegrates back into the dust and ash that they were made of.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Redaku_Reincarnation_Ninjutsu"}

He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll. From the scroll, more than a hundred puppets wearing red cloaks emerge.\nAs even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the Puppet Technique. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\nSasori stated that he brought down an entire country (Land of This in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with Chiyo and Sakura Haruno, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents. Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets. \nAs with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special poison, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.\nIn the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside Hiruko.[2]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Secret_Technique:_Performance_of_a_Hundred_Puppets"}

These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the afterlife, and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies. The exact limitations of this technique are unknown, but on one occasion, it was able to resurrect a large number of individuals who had recently died. While using this technique, the caster is severely weakened; for instance, Nagato's hair turned white as a result of overexerting his power.[2][3] Ultimately, once the technique is finished, the user invariably dies.[4]\nThis technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation into a real body of living flesh and blood.[5] However, whereas the rest of the reincarnated Madara Uchiha's body was made real, his eyes instead crumbled into dust upon his resurrection.[6]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Path_%E2%80%94_Samsara_of_Heavenly_Life_Technique"}

It grants the user the power to control life and death. With this power, the user is able to revive the dead, transmit their chakra into black receivers, and manifest chakra chains.\n\nOverview[]\nOne who wields the Rinnegan is said to exist outside the realm of life and death. They are regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path, and wield the power to control life and death itself. With this power, the user is able to revive the dead through the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique,[1] though doing so comes at the cost of the user's life.[2]\nThe Rinnegan allows for the creation of black receivers,[3] and by transmitting their chakra into these receivers, the user can bind anyone they touch through the power of the Outer Path. The user can also manifest the chakra chains of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path to restrain those who touch the receivers with an even greater binding power.[4] By implanting black receivers into corpses or reincarnated individuals, the user can reanimate and remotely control the bodies as the Six Paths of Pain. These bodies, as well as the King of Hell and the creatures summoned through the Animal Path, all have reflections of the Rinnegan in their eyes and share visual information with the user through the Outer Path.[5][6]\n\n     Souls summoned back from the Pure Land.  \nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki demonstrated the ability to recall the souls of the previous Kage from the Pure Land to assist him in summoning Team 7 and the tailed beasts back from Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki's core dimension.[7] When summoned in this manner, the deceased person does not have an actual body, but appears as a mass of flickering chakra in full possession of their personality and memories. Once the user ends the technique, the summoned souls dwindle and ultimately disappear completely. Hagoromo was also able to undo another person's use of the Impure World Reincarnation technique, releasing the reincarnated souls from their vessels and sending them to the Pure Land.[8]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Path"}

The enhanced regeneration granted by this technique is so rapid that even the wounds that resulted from Tsunade being impaled by two gigantic swords were completely healed mere moments after their removal.[3] As it builds on the Creation Rebirth, it shortens the user's lifespan.[1]\nUse of the technique also requires the release of the Strength of a Hundred Seal, but rather than just covering the face, the markings extend over the user's entire body. As a testament to both its power and her confidence in its healing prowess, Tsunade has decreed that only medical-nin who have mastered this technique are permitted to break the first three rules that govern their role on the battlefield \u2014 which effectively prohibit their direct involvement in any conflict \u2014 that she herself established. This makes herself and her student, Sakura, the only ones allowed to break these rules.[4]\nThis technique's power can be temporarily transferred to another person upon physical contact, as seen when Sakura extended the technique's markings onto Obito Uchiha.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ninja_Art_Creation_Rebirth_%E2%80%94_Strength_of_a_Hundred_Technique"}

Five of these beasts are described as divine beasts (\u795e\u7363, shinj\u016b), while the other four are referred to as divine priests (\u795e\u5b98, shinkan).[1]\nMenma summons them by forming a tiger seal, declaring \"Nine Mask Sv\u0101h\u0101\" (\u300c\u4e5d\u9762\u8607\u5a46\u8a36\u300d, \"Kumen Sowaka\") and chanting the kuji-in, which conjures a massive mandala featuring each kanji of the kuji-in encircled by nine rings, arrayed in the same cross pattern he wears on his cloak. Each of the masked beasts emerges from a specific ring.\n\nSeiry\u016b (\u9752\u9f8d, literally meaning: Azure Dragon), a dragon that resembles a seahorse. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u9752 (sei, \"azure\").\nByakko (\u767d\u864e, literally meaning: White Tiger), a lean and slender tiger. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u767d (byaku, \"white\").\nSuzaku (\u6731\u96c0, literally meaning: Vermilion Bird), a bird with elegant and dramatic plumage. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u6731 (shu, \"vermilion\").\nGenbu (\u7384\u6b66, literally meaning: Black Tortoise), a tortoise with a shell made of overlapping plates. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u7384 (gen, \"black\").\nKinja (\u91d1\u86c7, literally meaning: Golden Snake), a massive serpent with golden scales. It can bind opponents by wrapping its body around them. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u7a7a (k\u016b, \"sky\").\nTennyo (\u5929\u5973, literally meaning: Celestial Maiden), an angelic priestess with flowing robes. It uses translucent ribbons to whip at opponents. Like the Kinja, it can also bind opponents. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u7389 (gyoku, \"jewel\").\nShinigami (\u6b7b\u795e, literally meaning: Death God), a priest that resembles a skeleton and carries a scythe. A swing of this scythe unleashes sickle-like energy waves which drain targets of their chakra once they have passed through them. The waves can bypass the barriers set up by Hokuto Sennin and Nanto Sennin. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u4e09 (san, \"three\").\nHokuto Sennin (\u5317\u6597\u4ed9\u4eba, literally meaning: Northern Sage), a priest with a fox staff.

In unison with the Hokuto Sennin, it can trap opponents in purple cylindrical barriers. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji \u5357 (nan, \"south\").\nWhen defeated, they revert to their true forms, which are nine masked fox kits (\u5b50\u72d0, kogitsune) that each possess a single tail. They can also convert back into chakra that will arc through the air from their present location back to Menma.

Pain channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a priest.\nThe Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell. The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames. It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.[2]\nTo interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them. With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them. After answers are given, the King of Hell will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement. If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them. However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted. \nThe second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage. To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated. It did this for example to the Asura Path after it was destroyed by Ch\u014dji and Ch\u014dza Akimichi. With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies. During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines. \nKabuto Yakushi stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.[3]\n\nInfluences[]\nNaraka (Sanskrit: \u0928\u0930\u0915) is the Sanskrit word for the underworld. In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell. He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death. For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil. If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.\nIn Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or \"hell realm\", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives. There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results. The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.\nThe Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 254\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 422, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 8", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naraka_Path"}

These special tags then attach themselves to the intended target, but just as they detonate, additional tags are created as these previous ones explode.

Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's chakra, for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for j\u014dnin.[2] Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the Hokage. For this reason, the First Hokage declared it forbidden and hid it away in the Scroll of Seals. Naruto Uzumaki is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the sheer amount of chakra he has access to.[1]\nThere is no established number of created clones separating the regular Shadow Clone Technique from the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. Average users tend to make no more than five shadow clones at a time with the regular version, whereas Naruto will make dozens, hundreds, or sometimes even a thousand with the Multiple version. Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day takes it in the opposite direction, showing Naruto use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique yet only managing to make two clones because of how tired he is. Naruto sometimes doesn't even differentiate between the two techniques, simply saying \"Shadow Clone Technique\" regardless of how many clones he creates.\nWhereas a small number of clones can be useful in a variety of ways, the huge number of clones created for this technique are almost exclusively used offensively, overwhelming opponents with countless attacks from all around.[3] Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the Wind Release: Rasengan, completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.[4]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Multiple_Shadow_Clone_Technique"}

When performed, the Akimichi grows in size, proportionately increasing their weight and strength and thus making their physical attacks more powerful.[1] Clothes they're wearing will change in size to accomodate them, as will certain weaponry, such as the bo.[2] Such a significant change in size places a great burden on the user's body.[1] In keeping with this, users typically are not seen maintaining the Multi-Size Technique for long periods of time, instead reverting back to their normal form after they've concluded their series of attacks.[3] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Ch\u014dza and Ch\u014dji Akimichi at one point seem to use the Multi-Size Technique for several hours.[4]\nThere are two ways the Multi-Size has been depicted in the series. The first is where the user becomes extremely round, with most of the body's expansion being applied to their torso; because this is what happens to Ch\u014dch\u014d Akimichi when she uses it, she dislikes performing it.[5] The second is where the user simply becomes larger, bigger than their normal size but not so big as when they use the Super Multi-Size Technique.[6] In the manga, Ch\u014dji uses the first during Part I and the second during Part II and onwards, suggesting the user's age or experience has something to do with it. Episodes of the anime set during Part II occasionally show Ch\u014dji using the first version, instead suggesting the two versions are interchangeable.[7][8]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Multi-Size_Technique"}

When Mubi uses this technique, the figures are somewhat similar in appearance to him, but are not his exact lookalikes in the same that other clone techniques resemble their users. The black figures move slowly towards their target, provoking the target into attacking. Each time the figures are struck, the attacks pass through them, only briefly disfiguring their form. With each attack they receive, the figures multiply.[1]\nBecause this is only a genjutsu, the black figures cannot do any actual harm to their targets. However, if users - while hiding nearby - coordinate their attacks with the figures', such as by secretly throwing kunai along the same trajectory, targets may not realise the kunai are real and thus won't know to dodge until it's too late. Even if targets can avoid damage, being subjected to this sort of tactic for prolonged periods will inevitably wear them down, making them easy to finish off.[2]\n\nSee Also[]\nHaze Clone Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 172\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 62", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Mist_Servant_Technique"}

When the opponent counters and inflicts damage upon the puppet or the puppet inflicts damage on the enemy, the cursed seal will take effect, causing the kanji \"curse\" (\u546a, noroi) to disappear from the puppet's forehead and the two consciousness (that of the user's inside the puppet and that of the victim who countered) to switch. Consequently, the user will gain full control of the opponent's body, while the victim's mind remains trapped within the immobile puppet.\nLike the original technique, the user's body is left defenceless while the ability is active and any injury done to the victim's body is also reflected upon their true body, but this can be rectified if the user cancels the technique just before any damage is received.[3] Unlike the original, the user does not have to worry about the target's will overpowering their own, as it is sealed in the puppet.\n\nSee also[]\nPuppet Imitation Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 258\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 471, page 7", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Puppet_Switch_Cursed_Seal_Technique"}

Forming into a dragon with long whiskers, it attacks the target aiming to swallow them, at which point they are cut by the razor sharp winds inside the attack. After initiating the attack, the user appears to remain shielded within the base of the tornado as the outward surface of the dragon seems to be solid enough for a person to impact and rebound off of, making the only way to enter the technique once it has been initiated is by being swallowed.\nHowever, there is one distinct weakness to the technique. Since the Dragon God's true form is that of an ordinary tornado, its attack power is based on rotation. If one enters the attack's centre (Dragon's Eye) while rotating at high speed, such as Lee's One-Man Front Lotus, it can be dispersed without inflicting damage.\n\nSee Also[]\nDaytime Tiger\nEvening Elephant\nNight Guy", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Leaf_Dragon_God"}

Over time, the K\u0101ma will gradually overwrite the vessel's genetic profile until they transform into a perfect \u014ctsutsuki.

Eventually, Orochimaru cancelled the project out of disinterest, but Amachi managed to finalise it against his sponsor's abandonment, applying the process onto himself.\nThe experiment left parts of Isaribi's body permanently scaled, and Amachi falsely promised that he can return her to normal, but later confessed that he had no cure for her, and instead plotted to dissect her once he was finished using her. Shinobi sent by Konohagakure believe that Tsunade will be able to reverse Isaribi's modifications.\n\nUsage[]\nThe Kaima (\u6d77\u9b54, literally meaning: Ocean Demon) transformation can also change the user's eye colour, as seen in Amachi's case. This form gives them supreme fighting skills in the water, as they can move through the water much faster than normal, as well as giving them the ability to breathe underwater. Also the scales used in this form have a steel like quality that can stop a kunai.

According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \"decides\" it.[4]\n\nActivation Requirement[]\n     The mechanics behind the technique.  \nTo begin the technique, after selecting any arbitrary moment, the caster uses their Sharingan to remember the physical sensations both of their body and that of their opponent's during that instant like a photograph (represented as: A). The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: A'). Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness. The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated. The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami. They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well. The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.[5][6]\n\nEffects[]\nWhilst under the effects of the technique, the target stands motionlessly as the loop of events continually replays inside their mind.[7] Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.[8] The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami. Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations. However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.[9] In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra. The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.[10] The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke. The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n\nCreation[]\nAccording to Itachi, there was a point in time where members of the clan abused the abilities granted by Izanagi, instead simply casting the technique as a means of escaping the undesirable results of their actions. Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes. Thus, as d\u014djutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance. By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion. However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a kinjutsu.[11] As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n\nInfluence[]\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a Shint\u014d goddess. In this case, it is Izanami, who, together with her brother and husband Izanagi, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shint\u014d fire god, Kagutsuchi. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 232\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 581, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 1\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 581, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 2-5\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 338\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 586, pages 14-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 586, page 18\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 337\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, pages 3-6", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Izanami"}

The user first creates two masses of Iron Sand of opposing magnetic fields and then merges them together. This causes the magnetic forces to instantly increase and the repellent force created by the two opposing magnetic fields scatters the Iron Sand across a vast area.\nThe Iron Sand spreads in spikes that branch off irregularly, making it almost impossible to get a clear overview of what is happening. This also makes evading the spikes nearly impossible. Even if the opponent has managed to evade getting hit, the Iron Sand spikes will have filled the entire surroundings, cutting off any escape routes. With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.\nBecause Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal poison, the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 24", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Sand_World_Method"}

To perform, it requires a full intensive care unit, staffed by medics with refined chakra control. The procedure lasts many hours, requiring the constant attention of the medics on staff and,[1] inevitably, requiring backup shifts to replace medics who have tired out.[2] Because of how difficult the procedure is, there is a very low chance of actually saving the patient.[1]\nThe patient is placed in the centre of the floor. A large, complicated technique formula is drawn around them, focused around the injury to be healed.[2] A sample of the patient's cells, such as a lock of their hair, is placed near the injury, to be used as a medium for the procedure. Medics take position around the formula's perimeter, notably the corners, and work together to change the medium's cellular makeup, converting it into whatever cells are required for mending the wound. This is where the technique's greatest difficulty lies, as medics must be careful to form the correct cell and then just as carefully apply it to the regenerating injury.[1]\nIn the anime, Sakura Haruno is shown using this technique by herself; she needs neither the large formula nor the medium. Instead, four formula-lines are used to restore the missing section of the body. The technique is still very chakra-taxing, as Sakura fainted after using almost all of her chakra during the operation.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 T\u014d no Sho, page 247\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 235\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 395", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Healing_Resuscitation_Regeneration_Technique"}

The user can also form tendrils of the sludge to hold down the victims' limbs or defend themselves.\nThe downside to the technique is that the user will sink first and once the user dies, the technique will end. The deeper the user sinks, the more injury and pain they will incur. This makes it less likely to kill other targets, making this technique more suitable for stalling than actual combat.

Sasuke Uchiha remarked that it came close to replicating Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki's secret techniques.[1]\nThe seal is comprised of Hashirama Senju's cells and must be surgically implanted into a compatible vessel, a process which drains a great deal of the caster's vitality, shortening their lifespan. The seal itself acts as a gateway to a separate dimension that Tanuki called the underworld (\u7570\u754c, ikai), wherein dwells a legendary beast named Nue that is born the moment the seal is completed.[2]\nThe mark acts as a medium for absorbed chakra to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned. It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark chakra, which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state. As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\nThe principal usage of the Gozu Tenn\u014d is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\nAs the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed. When Sumire Kakei achieved this, a portion of the seal remained and migrated to her palm, allowing her to maintain her symbiotic bond with Nue.\n\nInfluence[]\nThe technique's name comes from Gozu Tenn\u014d, a Japanese deity of pestilence.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Gozu_Tenn%C5%8D"}

By ensnaring all living beings and connecting them to the tree, similar to cocoons, this will keep their now-slumbering bodies alive so long as they remain attached, while sapping their chakra. At the same time, this assimilates every victim to the God Tree, regathering the chakra into one location, in order to sprout a new fruit. It is one of the Jutsu with the greatest expansive power, spreading throughout the planet.\n\n     White Zetsu being created from humans caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.  \nThe chakra can also be collectively used by the user of this technique, as proven when Madara Uchiha's body began to rapidly absorb the chakra of everyone connected to the tree during his transformation into Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki. Over the course of years,[2] humans ensnared by this technique will be drained of their personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into White Zetsu.[3] Simply cutting the victims loose neither wakes them up, nor frees them from the tree, as other branches will relentlessly form and imprison them once again.[4]\nOnce the Infinite Tsukuyomi is cancelled, the branches, along with any preexisting White Zetsu, wither away and the entrapped people would be freed, assuming they have not already been converted into White Zetsu.[5]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 258\n\n\u2191 Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 679, pages 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 683, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 699, pages 8-11", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/God:_Nativity_of_a_World_of_Trees"}

The Ged\u014d Seal: Seal is a juinjutsu that can seal a target's abilities, including the kekkei genkai, causing pain to the target, even when not using their ability. The Ged\u014d Seal: Confusion causes blinding pain in the victim's head, which turns their body into a tool of the technique's caster. When used to fight another, they will feel no pain the victim's opponent has given them, and won't listen to what anyone says. This part of the technique can be cured without the use of a release command, if they defeat their inner self that is in their head. Hiruzen Sarutobi was troubled by the cruel effects of the Outer Path Seal, so he created a cure called the \"Ged\u014d Seal: Release\" (\u5916\u9053\u30ce\u5370\u30fb\u89e3, Ged\u014d no In: Kai, literally meaning: Outer Path Seal: Release) which can heal the effects of this technique from the target.

So long as at least one of the tags remains in place, a barrier will be created over the central location that prevents it from being opened or in any way physically damaged. Those wishing to remove the barrier are advised to break into two small teams for maximum efficiency: one team focuses on removing the four surrounding tags, while the second team removes the central tag and immediately afterwards storms the stronghold.[1]\nThe Five-Seal Barrier erected over an Akatsuki lair in the Land of Rivers has tags spread across an incredibly wide area, with one tag being 500 meters northeast of the lair's entrance and another being 800 meters southwest of the entrance.[2] This means having a sensor among those intending to breach a Five-Seal Barrier can save a significant amount of time.[1] Because the tags, once located, are simple to remove, the Akatsuki leader pairs his Five-Seal Barrier with a booby trap.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Sha no Sho, page 255\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 263\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 246", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Five-Seal_Barrier"}

Even without a direct hit, targets will receive extensive cutting damage from the vacuum vortex that's created by the Fang Wolf Fang's rotation.[1] The Fang Wolf Fang is powerful enough to sever Ukon from Sakon and leave a dent in the Summoning: Rash\u014dmon.

The said chakra becomes poisonous to the target, making their bodies unstable. Should the target then begin to bleed, the chakra will be set off, causing the victim's body to become consumed in a pitch-black substance before inflating in a grotesque manner and finally exploding on a large and on a very destructive scale. Only by blocking the chakra flow of the target or rendering them unconscious will nullify mutation and following explosion.

Neji Hy\u016bga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. The moment before the Hy\u016bga is struck by an attack, they emit chakra from all of their body's tenketsu to block it. They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.[4] The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.[5]\nRevolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hy\u016bga's Byakugan.[6] But in this regard it is quite effective, leading Tenten to describe it as an absolute defence superior to the Shield of Sand.[4] While normally a short-range manoeuvre, with greater skill one can increase the range of the chakra shield as Hiashi Hy\u016bga can repel attackers from several feet away and did so with such force that it ploughed the ground around him, cratering the terrain he was on save for the location he was standing at.[7] The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hy\u016bga from spinning;[8] the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.[9]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Palms_Revolving_Heaven"}

One method of doing this is for the user to convert chakra in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created. The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks. Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to fire and water than it would otherwise be.[1]\nA second method of performing this technique is to instead manipulate pre-existing earth directly: by placing their hands on the ground, users can raise the ground as a barrier in front of them.[3] Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose; Kakashi Hatake adorns his with bulldog sculptures. Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping[4] or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.[5] The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.[6]\nIn Kakashi Retsuden, the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the Fourth Shinobi World War, to make up for the loss of his Sharingan. His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives. Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.[7]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Earth-Style_Wall"}

Despite all this, Kakashi Hatake is able to do so, converting sections of his Earth-Style Wall that are about to be struck by lightning. He notes that the ability is ineffective against high concentrations of lightning, such as Chidori, because the heat that's generated would melt the glass.

Kazuma described it as the ultimate Earth element resurrection technique.\n\nOverview[]\nBy utilising soil in the local ground, the user can revive the fallen in one of two ways.\nThe first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or techniques at their disposal. They are fairly easy to destroy. If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.\nThe second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware. Unlike the Impure World Reincarnation technique, the soul is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed. This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e. electricity). At any time, by performing a Snake hand seal and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto Collectible Card Game", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Release_Resurrection_Technique:_Corpse_Soil"}

Because they are intoxicated, users move irregularly and erratically: they attack with no warning and defend with unconventional motions. Users have no conscious awareness of what actions they'll take, which also means opponents can't predict what they'll do. In Rock Lee's case, he also becomes extremely belligerent while drunk, thereby adding to his opponent's confusion because of how polite he usually is.[1] According to Might Guy, the Drunken Fist cannot be learned, taught, nor refined through training and practice.[citation needed]\nLee is a natural prodigy of the Drunken Fist.[1] After drinking only a small amount of alcohol, his cheeks become red and he goes into a drunken rage, picking fights with friends and foes alike.[2] Since he's already very gifted with taijutsu, Lee is extremely destructive in his drunken state;[1] during his first drunk experience, he destroyed the restaurant where he was dining and even Guy struggled to subdue him.[2] Because of how easily Lee becomes drunk, he also sobers just as easily: when Kimimaro only scratches his face,[3] Lee returns to normal shortly afterwards. Lee seems to have no memory of his actions while drunk, or at least he can't understand his hangover.[4]\nIn the anime, Lee developed a variant called Seasickness Fist, where he makes use of nausea caused by seasickness to overcome the fact he can't drink alcohol.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Drunken_Fist"}

The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect chakra-based defences, witnessed from \u014cnoki's use of it to destroy Madara Uchiha's Susanoo.[2]\n\n     Kak\u014d's large variant.  \nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an entire island.[3] Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad wood clones in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.[4] When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.[5]\nKak\u014d has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).[6]\n\nShape Variants[]\nThis technique can be manipulated into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it.

This style, comprised of sheer unpredictable movements, can easily catch his opponents off-guard.

B, using any number of swords can easily close in on and exploit an opponent's vital points.[1] To maximise the style's killing potential, he could, in tandem with his seven Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords, make use of his unique and peculiar kenjutsu Acrobat.[1]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Fourth Databook, page 229\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 411, page 11-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 549, pages 14-17", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Disturbance_Taijutsu"}

The chains move very fast, able to bypass Gaara's Shield of Sand, which is known for its speed. Once latched on to the target's body and chakra network, the chains will use the tenketsu located at the navel to reach their way to the tailed beast and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the jinch\u016briki. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinch\u016briki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinch\u016briki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinch\u016briki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\nThe technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Dharma_Power_Sealing_Technique:_Sen_no_Riky%C5%AB"}

According to Obito, this binding power is far greater than that of Nagato's Outer Path.[3] The chains possess a cursed seal that suppresses the power of tailed beasts,[4] and also cause a great deal of pain to their victims.[5]\nObito was able to generate these chains through the use of black receivers. He implanted a single receiver into each of his Six Paths of Pain, which were made into temporary jinch\u016briki. By manifesting chains from the jinch\u016briki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and suppress the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.[5] When Naruto Uzumaki was trapped inside the Four-Tails' mouth, Obito attempted to capture him by dragging the beast inside his own body using these chains.[6] The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinch\u016briki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.[7]\n\n     The Demonic Statue emitting chains.  \nThe Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth. When Madara retrieved his Rinnegan and took control of the statue, he used it to produce chains with tips shaped like a dragon's head.[8] These chains were able to quickly restrain and seal all nine tailed beasts by wrapping around their necks like collars and dragging them into the statue. The chains are also capable of extracting tailed beasts from their jinch\u016briki, as well as preventing them from cancelling their Tailed Beast Mode. In the event that they are severed, these chains can easily be reconnected.[9][10]\n\nSee Also[]\nAdamantine Sealing Chains\nBeast Sealing Technique\nDharma Power Sealing Technique: Sen no Riky\u016b\nSealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals\nTight Binding Golden Chain Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Naruto chapter 569, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 601, page 7\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 569, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 598, page 10\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 567, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 569, pages 2-4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 570, pages 1-6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 659, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 660, pages 1, 12-13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 661, pages 1-4", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic_Statue_Chains"}

Haku creates several large mirrors out of ice, which he surrounds a target with.[1] By entering one of these mirrors,[2] Haku's reflection will appear in all of them. Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously. As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown senbon - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.[1] Using the technique requires a great deal of chakra from Haku, meaning he cannot use it indefinitely.[3] In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.[4]\nAlthough Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that Rin no Sho describes it as light speed,[1] it is still possible to track him: Sasuke Uchiha, with his undeveloped Sharingan, becomes able to follow his movements, and with enough time could even attack Haku;[3] Naruto Uzumaki, after entering an initial jinch\u016briki form, is able to dodge Haku as well.[5] Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard Fire Release,[6] Naruto's jinch\u016briki form is strong enough to shatter one.[5] The mirrors will also shatter if Haku stops maintaining them.[7]\nThese exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique. Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them. If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.[1] If Haku completely surrounds his victims with mirrors, such as the dome he uses against Sasuke, then they are effectively trapped; only allies working from outside the dome stand a reasonable chance of saving them.[6] Even targets who manage to keep their distance from Haku are not safe, as he can simply form a mirror next to them, allowing him to quickly travel to and attack them.[8]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic_Mirroring_Ice_Crystals"}

Therefore, they rely on allies to fend off or distract opponents until they're ready.[3]\nOnce the toads have harmonized and have begun singing, all opponents \u2013 regardless of number or skill \u2013 who hear it will fall under the genjutsu's influence.

Because the clam can continually produce steam from its siphons,[2] Gengetsu's illusions can last indefinitely.\nAccording to Gengetsu, the only method to end the technique is to defeat the real clam, stopping it from producing steam. But as the creature itself remains camouflaged within the mirage, this is no easy task, even if the summoner is providing beneficial advice. While the technique is in effect, both Gengetsu and the clam cannot be sensed through traditional means, with the exception of contact type methods.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Fourth Databook, page 294\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 552, page 12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 557, page 4", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic_Illusion:_Steaming_Multistoried_Building"}

The seal is located of the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his manubrium. When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines. When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail.

Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active. The second level also increases his healing might, as his torn flesh was instantly restored upon his transformation.\nKimimaro must enter his second level in order to properly use the Dance of the Clematis: Flower, due to the resultant weapon's size and density.[1] In his second level, he can also merge with the bone blades created by his Dance of the Seedling Fern, allowing him to launch a deadly surprise attack at his target's blindspot.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 257\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 227", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Seal_of_Earth"}

The seal was applied on the left side of the back of both Sasuke's and Anko's necks.\nAnko received her cursed seal when she was a student of Orochimaru. She, along with nine others, were the first people to receive a cursed seal. She was the only one to survive the application, establishing the one-in-ten success rate for the procedure. Because she lacked the will to use it, her seal receded, and (in the anime) Orochimaru wiped her memory. Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again. It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.[2]\nOrochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Ch\u016bnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body. Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal. Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four. \nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes. During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\nAccording to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 593, page 9", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Seal_of_Heaven"}

So long as Creation Rebirth remains active, the user cannot die, earning it recognition as the \"pinnacle of medical ninjutsu\" and the \"ultimate regeneration technique\".[1]\nCreation Rebirth does not repair the old cells, instead hastening the creation of new ones through division.

At the same time, its compressed nature can cause severe recoil, greatly straining the user's arm, making it dangerous to use often.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nRunt Ball Rasengan\nMini-Rasenshuriken\nSuper Mini-Tailed Beast Ball\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 181", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Compression_Rasengan"}

In fact, Konohagakure's Ninja Academy prevents students from graduating unless they master this technique, it was for this reason that Naruto Uzumaki failed three exams in a row. For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves to move alongside them. Unlike most other clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents. Because of this, it is only useful for distracting enemies while other attacks are prepared.[1] Opponents can identify clones from their original through careful observation, as clones won't crush grass, kick up dust, etc.[citation needed]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Technique"}

This technique uses shape transformation to form the original Chidori into a spear or blade-shape, adapting it for mid-range attacks with a maximum range of about five metres.[3] Its increased range means there is less of a risk to the user. It also has the advantage of being able to be used for surprise attacks and capturing. \nWhen the enemy's body is pierced, the user can alter the spear's shape into multiple additional blades, increasing the number of wounds.[4] The blade can also be swung in order to cut things as well as cause fatal injuries. Sasuke has shown that he can also channel this technique through his chokut\u014d.[5]\nBecause of Sasuke's mastery in kenjutsu, this technique can act as a makeshift sword if he loses his sword.\nAfter infusing this technique with Six Paths Chakra, Sasuke was able to bisect through the revived Madara in his jinch\u016briki form.[6]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chidori_Sharp_Spear"}

When using this attack on a great number of enemies at once, it can effectively double as an instant defence. The body of the person touched by the Chidori will misinterpret the lightning nature as \"electrical signals from the nerves\", making its muscles contract. This causes the body to involuntarily go stiff, while at the same time receives damage. This attack can also be channelled through the ground to increase the range of the attack.[2]\n\nSee Also[]\nLightning Release: Lightning Rod\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 284\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 384, page 11", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chidori_Current"}

By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects. \n\nKnown Words[]\nThe effects of these kanji have been shown:\n\n\u64cd, which comes from the verb \u64cd\u308b (ayatsuru), meaning \"to manipulate\". This character allows Shiranami to manipulate and control his opponent. The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the Infinite Embrace, it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.\n\u6ec5, which comes from the verb \u6ec5\u3059\u308b (messuru), meaning \"to destroy\". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon. Utakata destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.\n\u5ca9 (iwa, rock). This character allows Shiranami to immobilise targets. In the case of clones, this dispels them.\n\u7206 (baku, explode). This character causes several explosions that can also be used to dispel clones.\n\u706b (hi, fire). This character creates a blaze of fire, which can vary in size.\n\u708e (en, flames). This character creates a large wall of fire to keep the enemies away.\n\u65ac (zan), which comes from the verb \u65ac\u308b (kiru), meaning \"to kill with a blade\". This character creates several blades of wind.\n\u5272 (katsu, split).

The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique was originally created by Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninsh\u016b, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\nVariations[]\nCertain people, such as\u00a0Minato Namikaze and Naruto Uzumaki could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.[1] In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.[2] Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\nKatsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing. Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.[3]\nTsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give \u014cnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.[4] Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\nZetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.[5]\nDan Kat\u014d was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.[6] Obito did something similar to give his chakra and d\u014djutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.[7]\nJ\u016bgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.[8][9]\nTailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.[10][11]\nHagoromo \u014ctsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.[12] Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.[13]\nIn the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaich\u016b are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.[14]\nIn the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way. First Nang\u014d sends his chakra to Benten and Ch\u016bshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.[15] He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 617, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 616\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 634, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 588, pages 13-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 466, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 591, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 688, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 618, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 572, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 609, pages 13-14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 665, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 671, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 304\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 144", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra_Transfer_Technique"}

However, due to having one's chakra suppressed, they will be unable to use jutsu.\nThe \u014ctsutsuki Clan can naturally suppress their chakra signature. A vessel which been has sufficiently changed into an \u014ctsutsuki can access this ability on instinct, without being consciously aware of its existence.

This is a great technique for capturing someone alive, or for inflicting damage by constriction, and if the situation calls for it, the snakes can bite the victim with their poison fangs. With the summons specified beforehand, the procedure can be shortened by using blood on a summoning \"contract seal\" (\u7d50\u5370, ketsuin), making it possible to use the technique immediately. The further addition of the user's killing intent can weaken their target's resolve.\nSnakes summoned by this technique are on a whole other level in terms of intelligence and strength, compared to normal summons.

By doing this, the Inuzuka gains a copy of themselves that serves the same practical purpose as a shadow clone but without a shadow clone's steep chakra requirement. Even though they look identical, the ninken - because it's an animal - is likely to give away which of the two is which from how it moves and acts. To counteract this, the Inuzuka typically uses an Imitation Beast Ninja Art, causing them to act more feral and thus make it harder to tell them apart.[1] As with any transformation, the ninken will revert to their original form if they're knocked out.[2]\nWhen the Beast Human Clone is first used during the Ch\u016bnin Exams arc, Akamaru is seemingly the one to use this technique after he's been fed a soldier pill.[3] When it's used again during the Sasuke Recovery Mission, it is seemingly performed by Akamaru's partner, Kiba Inuzuka, instead.[4] On both occasions, the Beast Human Clone's use typically precedes the Fang Passing Fang. By Part II, the Beast Human Clone no longer seems necessary for Kiba and Akamaru's manoeuvres, presumably because Akamaru's natural size is much closer to Kiba's than it was in Part I.", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Beast_Human_Clone"}

By using the toad's tongue to drag in whatever it wraps around, this technique is best used to capture and isolate a victim dragging them into the toad's stomach. Isolated from the outside world by a barrier, the dimension sealed inside the Gourd Toad's stomach is far larger than the size of the Gourd Toad itself. Even if at a moment's notice, only the technique's caster can freely enter and exit the isolated space. Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive gastric acid that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 253", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Barrier:_Toad_Gourd_Prison"}

When the area is entered by an opponent, a barrier is created. The barrier's properties vary depending on the tags used:[1] the Sound Four, for example, use explosive tags, which allows it to serve as a sort of booby-trap.[2] To prevent the trap from being noticed, the individual tags are placed in hidden locations, such as the shade of trees. Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.[1] Shikaku Nara once forced his son, Shikamaru, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as \"a high-class ninjutsu\".[2]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Barrier_Method_Formation"}

These creatures appear to be immortal, as they were killed and later summoned again. Worthy of note, summoning creatures through the Animal Path require no blood sacrifice or hand seals. The Animal Path can also summon people using hand signs, such as the case of Nagato's Paths and Konan. Tactics-wise, the Animal Path's primary role in battle appears to consist of overwhelming multiple opponents with a barrage of summons.\nIn the case of Nagato, having originally channelled the Animal Path through the corpse of a F\u016bma clan shinobi and then the corpse of Ajisai in life, the creatures summoned appear to have undergone the same modifications as his Paths of Pain, having chakra receivers embedded in their bodies. Nagato also tends to send the Animal Path first into battle to throw enemies off about the number of enemies they are really facing. As they also display the Rinnegan, the creatures serve as extensions of Nagato.[1] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used his summons for transport before being rejuvenated to move on his own power. \n\nSummons\n\nGiant Drill-Beaked Bird\nGiant Multi-Headed Dog\nGiant Snake-Tailed Chameleon\nGiant Panda\nGiant Ox\nGiant Rhino\nGiant Crustacean\nGiant Centipede\nThe other Paths of Pain\nKonan\nInfluences[]\nBuddhists believe that animals inhabit a different dimension separated from humans not spatially but mentally; an unhappy plane of rebirth which revolves around fear, instinct and survival of the fittest, suffered by those animals that work for humans and, above all, by those ignorant to what is happening to them.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Animal_Path"}

Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.[5] Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below;[2] when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.[5]\nWhen Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth). It is only from noticing that the new world is too vast in size and intricate in detail that he realises it cannot be a mere illusion.[2] He nevertheless revisits the genjutsu comparison later, noting that - from his perspective - Kaguya seems to be instantly rewriting reality with each use of Amenominaka.[5]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Amenominaka"}

It was a technique designed by \u014cnoki to protect the village from attackers while lowering the number of casualties.\n\nOverview[]\nThe Akuta creates living organisms made of clay[1] that are weaponised. They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.[2] While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with fabrications.[3] Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.\nWhile deemed to have no will, this was prove false in Akkun's existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to Inojin Yamanaka, and even defied its comrades to protect him. Kirara deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits. When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against \u014cnoki's orders.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\u014cnoki created this technique in response to a missing-nin's attack claiming the lives of many young shinobi. When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, \u014cnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\nIwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 88\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 82\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 89", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Akuta"}

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent. Orochimaru labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,[7] but Jin no Sho describes it only as a \"glimpse\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nBeast Sealing Technique\nDemonic Statue Chains\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 253\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 498\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 408\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 503\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 504\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 501\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 663", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Adamantine_Sealing_Chains"}

More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]", "url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat"}
