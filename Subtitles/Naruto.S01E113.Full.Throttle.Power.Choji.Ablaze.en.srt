1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,187
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,859
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,529
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:34,201
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,956
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,045
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,300
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,803
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,603
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,273
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,276
In time, we'll realize

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,030
that it was everything

14
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,658
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

15
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,496
creating a river of tears

16
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:24,335
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

17
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:30,007
and melting away

18
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,140
I'm counting on you, Choji!
Yeah!

19
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,062
Expansion Jutsu!

20
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,773
All right, let's go!

21
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,406
Human Boulder!

22
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,516
What?!

23
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:35,489
Choji... You are awesome, after all!

24
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:43,831
Full Throttle Power!
Choji, Ablaze!

25
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,183
They got away from
my Barrier Ninjutsu...

26
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,608
He's the only one here.

27
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,111
Seems like the others went ahead.

28
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,740
Yeah.

29
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,575
They're not around
here any more.

30
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,537
Damn... Just when we thought
we caught up.

31
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,593
Everybody, you did well...

32
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,305
for some losers.

33
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,557
What?!
Who are you calling losers?!

34
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,062
Once we're out, it's our battle to win!

35
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,648
I-I will do it!

36
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,066
Wait you two!

37
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,112
It's dangerous to fight them
head on right now!

38
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,491
We tore through the barrier!
We can do this!

39
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,579
Tunneling Fang!

40
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,583
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

41
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,336
– Take this!
– Take this!

42
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,552
You guys are my meal!
Darn it!

43
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,554
Shoulder Charge!

44
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,016
Knee Lift!

45
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,729
Not even good enough for an appetizer!

46
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,150
Be careful everyone!
Another tricky one is coming!

47
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,908
Earth Style Barrier:
Earth Dome Prison!

48
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,161
Expansion Jutsu!

49
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,456
Human Boulder!

50
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,387
Damn!
Such useless acts...

51
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,185
There's no time.

52
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,647
We're going to split into two here!

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,649
Why?!

54
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,235
I see...

55
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,415
Even at 5 against 1,
with our Chakras taken away,

56
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,667
he's not someone we can
easily defeat...

57
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,464
If we take our time,
Sasuke will pass the borders.

58
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,343
If that happens, we won't be able
to handle this on our own.

59
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,224
So we split up...
one team to stop him

60
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,643
and one to go after Sasuke, right?

61
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,397
Yeah. The sub leader is going
to be you, Neji.

62
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,917
I found them!

63
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,296
Neji! Take Kiba and Choji,
and go after Sasuke!

64
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,380
Got it!

65
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,553
This guy...
Naruto and I will handle!

66
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,515
Are you going to put
the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?

67
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,559
Such a foolish Jutsu.

68
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,646
I don't need to see that kind of
street performance more than once!

69
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,485
And who was it that got tricked
by that street performance earlier?

70
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,678
He disappeared?!

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,764
Behind us!

72
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,569
Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!

73
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,571
He's nuts!

74
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,213
Be careful!
There's another one coming!

75
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,138
You are the platoon leader,
if I'm not mistaken.

76
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,350
You sure do suffer
when you have a stupid leader.

77
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,186
You underlings!

78
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,315
A stupid leader like this...

79
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll get rid of for you!

80
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,861
Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!

81
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,033
Thanks! Choji...

82
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,995
Why? Wasting my good intentions...

83
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,004
If the leader is stupid,
then I guess the subordinates are losers.

84
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,844
Well... I'll kill you losers
before you suffer

85
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,139
working under
a glum shadow lover like him!

86
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,059
Darn, darn! Babbling on like that!

87
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,393
I will...!

88
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,645
He's mine!

89
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,941
I will...take care of him!

90
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,529
Choji...
What are you saying?!

91
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,241
He's not the kind of guy
you can handle on your own!

92
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,076
I will do it!

93
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,745
Choji... you...

94
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,754
Shikamaru...
Take these Food Pills for everyone...

95
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,465
Choji... You are not...

96
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,427
That's right.
I have that secret weapon of mine.

97
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,180
But Choji, that is...!

98
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,603
Huh... Losers, I won't let you
have your way!

99
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,854
He's coming!

100
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,816
I'll get rid of you all here!

101
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,652
Go, everyone!

102
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,867
Pills of three colors?
They're not Food Pills.

103
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,952
What are they?

104
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,080
First...Spinach Pill!

105
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,790
Get out of the way! Loser!

106
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,215
Impossible... He stopped me?!

107
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,427
Shikamaru, take everybody and go!

108
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,345
Choji...

109
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,224
What did we gather for?

110
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:04,396
If we lose Sasuke,
then we will end up like he said...

111
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,151
The stupid leader and his losers!

112
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,326
You better catch up with us, Choji!

113
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,785
Yeah.

114
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,038
Everybody, go!

115
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,415
All right! Let's go, everyone!

116
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,000
– Yeah!
– Right!

117
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,715
Choji...

118
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,429
I'm going to get rid of you quick
and get rid of those guys too!

119
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,016
It won't be that easy...

120
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,407
What?!

121
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,088
I will...

122
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,928
...stop you!

123
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,574
A parting gift from Choji...
Eat it!

124
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,118
Yeah!

125
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,120
Thanks, Choji...

126
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,999
Kiba!
Thanks!

127
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,796
Shikamaru...
That pill that Choji took earlier..

128
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,298
It seemed like some sort
of trump card,

129
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,509
but does he have a chance to win?

130
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,762
He said that he has a secret weapon.

131
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:07,853
He brought the Akimichi clan's
ultimate secret pills on this mission...

132
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,274
These are the Triad Colored Pills
of green, yellow, and red.

133
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,944
If you take it,
you can gain explosive powers.

134
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:21,032
The energy that each pill
contains is enormous!

135
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,036
I see! I see!
So that's why he was so confident!

136
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,584
But...there's always a side effect
to any pills that work too well.

137
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,849
Damn... I didn't think it would hurt
so much with just the Spinach Pill.

138
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,482
I hope that Choji can settle it
with just the green pill.

139
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,527
Don't take the red one,
no matter what, Choji.

140
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,161
I'm going to finish you at once!

141
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,675
Expansion Jutsu!

142
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,646
Spiky Human Boulder.

143
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,823
He raised the rotational
and destructive power

144
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,409
by using the Kunai Knives as spikes!

145
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,876
Earth Style:Terra Shield.

146
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,178
What?!

147
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,369
I-I did it...?

148
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,753
Yeah. That's what I was thinking too.

149
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,214
Akamaru...
What is he saying?

150
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,092
You know that Akamaru
can tell the strength of the enemy

151
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,011
just by the smell, right?

152
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:52,017
He's worried if Choji is going to be able
to handle that monster with just the pills.

153
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,979
True...

154
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,231
If we were to assess
the situation objectively,

155
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,442
that giant's ability is unknown...

156
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,904
The possibility of Choji being able
to defeat him might be close to zero.

157
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,489
But...

158
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,243
That is how battle is...

159
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,756
Don't get carried away, loser!

160
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,384
Shatter Palm!

161
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,272
Did you know?

162
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,399
When there's a group of people
of five or so,

163
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,318
there's always one loser.

164
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,864
That person is always made fun of...

165
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,991
and when it comes down to it,

166
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,285
they'll just toss that person
aside like a pawn.

167
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,206
I'm talking about you!

168
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:05,757
Choji. All you want to do is eat.
You should train some at least!

169
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:12,222
You get teased because you're like that.
You're just a f...

170
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,724
You said somebody exceptional, right?

171
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,227
Shouldn't we ask Shino or somebody?!

172
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,147
This guy is useless too...

173
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,618
That is true...

174
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,664
No matter how hard I try on my own...

175
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,458
I...

176
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,802
Seems like I hit it right on the nose.

177
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,724
Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,

178
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,310
seeing that they pick a loser
like you to be on the pursuit team.

179
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,942
Why don't we finish this up already?!

180
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,697
Knee Lift!

181
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,741
Shoulder Charge!

182
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,746
Huh! You really are a loser to the end!

183
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,166
Your high spirit didn't last long at all,
only at the beginning...!

184
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,377
You really are the ideal loser!

185
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:32,218
A loser like you shouldn't have come
to a place like this!

186
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,597
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!

187
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,185
Shikamaru...

188
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,646
Neji's right. It's how a battle is.

189
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,442
From the start, this mission
wasn't for recreation.

190
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,694
It's life or death.

191
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,614
Hey Shikamaru...

192
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,241
I already anticipated the worst scenario

193
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,453
in which we would be fighting
separately on our own.

194
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,621
And at this point,

195
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,332
if we're not prepared for
"one person, one kill,"

196
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,083
we might not be able
to catch up to Sasuke.

197
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,262
Choji is a good guy,
but he doesn't have the confidence.

198
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:21,226
He thinks that
he's the weakest of all of us.

199
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,104
He actually is weak.
Anybody can see that.

200
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:30,151
That's why he was the first to
stay behind to try to be useful.

201
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,612
Just as I thought...

202
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,075
But...

203
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,510
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,

204
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,054
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

205
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,890
But Shikamaru...

206
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:20,076
But, if we fight against each other,
you might be stronger.

207
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,289
I might have given up fighting
against you too.

208
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,250
And you're you...

209
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,336
But...

210
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,634
Shikamaru...has always...

211
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,142
Shikamaru has always
believed in me...

212
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,145
Choji...are you ready?!

213
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,860
He believed that I was really strong!

214
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,621
That's why he left it up to me alone!

215
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,546
Just as I thought...

216
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:20,386
So everybody thinks that...
But...I know...

217
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,352
More than myself or Neji
or any of us here...

218
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,228
He is stronger!

219
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,818
And...I believe it.

220
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.

221
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,243
But...it's a far cry
from being a main dish...

222
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,207
Let's go, fatso!

223
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,627
Don't YOU say that!

224
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,672
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

225
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,775
Once in a long while,

226
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,404
once in a while

227
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:25,118
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

228
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:30,206
Look like a mountain

229
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,963
Clinging to the Divine,

230
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,883
clinging to Buddha

231
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:46,681
The remnants of a person crying

232
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,268
Look like a mountain

233
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,981
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

234
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,193
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

235
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,155
Shake shake shake
Let's look

236
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:06,409
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

237
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,548
Look like a mountain

238
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,137
Look like a mountain

239
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,182
Look like a mountain

240
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:33,227
Look like a mountain

241
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,777
I can't move because of the pain.

242
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,696
I didn't think the side effects
of the secret pill would be strong.

243
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,992
What do I do?
I only have one more pill.

244
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:53,247
But if I take it, if I take it,
I will...surely...

245
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:58,753
Next time: "Good-Bye Old Friend!
I'll Always Believe in You!"

246
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,589
Of all people,
I cannot forgive you!
