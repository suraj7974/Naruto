1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,387
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,057
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,686
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,693
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,366
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,711
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:50,718
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,652
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,156
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,701
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,375
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,588
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:35,596
For a start, wake up
that medium kid.

21
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,680
It will release that Jutsu!

22
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,557
How do we go about waking him?!

23
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,477
Give him a good punch!

24
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,064
But with that said...

25
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,733
I'm not particularly good
at transformations...

26
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,818
Huh?

27
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:53,948
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,367
Time for a combined transformation!

29
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,956
We got to have fangs and claws!
Let's go!

30
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,458
Transform!

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,183
Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light

32
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,023
F-Fox...?

33
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,096
What a battle...

34
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,226
I can't call this place safe either, huh...

35
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,604
Darn it!

36
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,315
His power is increasing
more and more!

37
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,610
Chief! We got to hurry up and rouse
that guy out of his sleep!

38
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,534
I know that!

39
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,579
Here goes...!

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,418
Go to hell!

41
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,560
All right! Now!

42
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:47,895
Okay!

43
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,902
Wake the hell up!

44
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,159
You jerk...

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,786
All right!

46
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,622
Not that much time has passed
since the medium went to sleep!

47
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,625
In that state,
one blow should be enough!

48
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,963
Darn!

49
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,383
It hasn't been long since I emerged!

50
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,929
The Jutsu has been dissolved!

51
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,811
Even if the Playing Possum Jutsu
is dissolved,

52
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,813
he's still putting on the pressure?

53
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,617
That guy interfered with my Jutsu...?!

54
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,163
Sand Coffin!

55
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,165
– Pop!
– Yeah!

56
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,836
It's the chief's tongue...

57
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,504
Don't take me for a fool!

58
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,808
Darn!

59
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,645
What kind of strength
does this guy possess?

60
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,647
This doesn't look good...!

61
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,985
Both Naruto and I have already
completely disgorged our Chakra!

62
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:25,784
You will be killed by me!
I will not cease to exist!

63
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,999
Leaf Hurricanes!

64
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,138
Besides just the Sound Ninja,
I wouldn't have imagined that

65
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,725
this many of the Sand Jonin
would enter into the village, too!

66
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,229
Well, it's understandable.
This is what is called war.

67
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,151
It's taking much too long.

68
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,947
It's impossible for a battle
between Shinobi to last this long.

69
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,700
What the heck is happening inside?

70
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,424
You're still grabbing my arm...

71
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,301
I can't use my Jutsu this way...

72
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,388
Come on,
let go of me once and for all.

73
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,654
I'm not letting your ambitions
interfere with the village...any longer...

74
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:49,409
There's no stopping my ambitions!
You will die here!

75
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,329
You old dotard...

76
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,332
As the Third Hokage,

77
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,670
are you saying you still have
the power to save this village?

78
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,551
Do you understand...
the current situation?!

79
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,352
Many Hidden Sand Shinobi and
my subordinates

80
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,398
have infiltrated this village.

81
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,452
Your side...the Leaf Shinobi...

82
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,165
will be annihilated down to
every last woman and child!

83
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,251
I will accomplish the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf Village!

84
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,641
It's empty inside!

85
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,851
There's nobody there!

86
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,686
That's very strange...

87
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,854
Huh?

88
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,857
Why is there so little resistance
when we've closed in

89
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,401
all the way to the center
of the Hidden Leaf Village?

90
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,903
That's...

91
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,866
And also...there's not one woman
or child in sight.

92
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,284
What is the reason for that?

93
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,634
Huh?!

94
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,136
Konohamaru...?

95
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,430
What's the matter, Konohamaru?

96
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,767
I gotta use the toilet.

97
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,061
M-Me too...

98
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,938
I do too...

99
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,364
K-Konohamaru...!

100
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,367
This is an emergency situation!

101
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,328
If the enemy finds us,
it will cost us!

102
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,497
Go back to the other room
and stay quiet!

103
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,377
I-It's not that... I gotta pee!

104
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,878
Hold it!

105
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,173
I don't think I can hold it...

106
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,471
Gimme a break.
In that case, come along with me...

107
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,348
Can't hold it!

108
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,684
Can't! Can't hold...!

109
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,185
That's...

110
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,354
At last, huh...

111
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,619
I'll get revenge for you
no matter what...

112
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,956
Hayate.

113
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,836
That's the signal. Let's go!

114
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,212
Roger!

115
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,601
You don't get it, do you, Orochimaru?

116
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,941
Don't underestimate the Shinobi
of this Village!

117
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,574
Are you all right?

118
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,451
Yeah...

119
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,036
Is that...the last?

120
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,705
Yes, the evacuation is complete!

121
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,751
W-What's happening?

122
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,420
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
has an instruction manual

123
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,464
outlining what to do in case of
a sneak attack by the enemy.

124
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:17,052
Step One:
Eliminate the enemy's sneak attack force.

125
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,846
In case one is unable
to eliminate them,

126
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,682
proceed immediately to Step Two.

127
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,311
The immediate evacuation
of noncombatants!

128
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,982
Evacuate the women and children
to shelters around the village!

129
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,486
When that has been completed,
proceed to Step Three!

130
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,571
Step Three...?

131
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,824
Through the collective strength
and efforts of the Village,

132
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,283
eliminate the enemy!

133
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,410
In that case...!

134
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,872
The counteroffensive...starts now!

135
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,512
We will not allow you to take
even one step beyond this point!

136
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,863
Sakura!

137
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,367
Rescue Sakura,
if it's the last thing you do!

138
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,204
I'll protect Sakura no matter what!

139
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,509
You will be killed by me.
I will not cease to exist.

140
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,011
My back is against the wall...

141
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,555
I have to hurry up
and stop that Demon Raccoon...

142
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,476
Please...

143
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,480
Just a small amount is fine...

144
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,607
Give me...

145
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,869
some Chakra!

146
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,773
What are you doing...?
There's only one opponent!

147
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,371
Hyuga is the magnum force
of the Leaf Village.

148
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,789
Don't forget that!

149
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,880
M-My...body...is immobilized...

150
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,175
Is this the first time
you're experiencing

151
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,928
the Leaf's hidden technique,
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?

152
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,764
Well, take this too while I'm at it...

153
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,269
The Leaf's hidden technique...
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

154
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,733
Expansion Jutsu!

155
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,034
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

156
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,331
W-What's this?!

157
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,126
My body is...all on its own...!

158
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,210
S-Stop...

159
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,170
Stop!

160
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,597
Reminds me of the old days!

161
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,806
Yeah!

162
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,351
The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!

163
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,026
-Kuromaru...let's go!
-Right!

164
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,987
In order to protect the village,

165
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,617
all the Leaf Shinobi will risk
their lives fighting!

166
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,496
Real strength doesn't lie

167
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,876
in the mastering of all Jutsu!

168
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,380
The poison in my body is...

169
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,301
Don't move, Shino.
I inserted my Parasitic Insects.

170
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,637
They are removing the poison.

171
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,639
Dad...

172
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,019
I believe I taught this
to you too, in the past...

173
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,938
It is when one protects
someone important...

174
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,151
that the true strength of
the Shinobi will emerge!

175
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,740
I will protect everyone!

176
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,497
Here I come! You idiot raccoon!

177
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,207
Die...!

178
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,797
Darn...

179
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,884
Darn it!

180
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,871
D-Did he win...?

181
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,833
A simple head blow...

182
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,794
His manner of fighting
is incredibly clumsy,

183
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,631
but to think that he could squeeze out
Chakra at that critical stage.

184
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,386
I've never seen a knucklehead Ninja
like him before, but...

185
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,639
he sure is the first phenomenal kid
I've seen in a long time.

186
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,436
It's too bad that I can't see this through
to the end,

187
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,022
but I've reached my limit.

188
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,650
Gamakichi, let's head home!

189
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,861
Okay! Pop!

190
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,558
As might be expected, even I...
am empty now...

191
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,187
You are too, aren't you?

192
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:48,401
We're much alike...
let's make this time the last!

193
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,948
It appears that...

194
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:58,912
I don't have the strength left

195
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,456
to yank out your entire soul.

196
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,585
However, your ambition ends here!

197
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,045
Not yet!

198
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,631
There's no stopping my ambition!

199
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,925
I have a suitable punishment for you

200
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:17,597
who have become addicted to the Jutsu
and who have overindulged in the Jutsu!

201
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,184
I will take all your Jutsu away with me!

202
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,393
What did you say?!

203
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,819
There!

204
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,029
Don't tell me that..?

205
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,989
Stop that!

206
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,494
Seal!

207
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,673
My...My arms...

208
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,555
Now...you can no longer use
either of your arms.

209
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,226
And since you can't use your arms,
you can't weave Signs.

210
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,521
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!

211
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:14,070
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf...dies right here!

212
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,449
You old dotard!
Give me back my arms!

213
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,287
Orochimaru, you fool...

214
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,874
It's unfortunate that
we can't leave together,

215
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
but, my disciple...

216
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,088
let's meet in the other world one day.

217
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,215
You old dotard...
whose life is hanging by a thread!

218
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,844
How dare you!
How dare you take away my Jutsu!

219
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,495
In places where the Leaf dances,
a fire burns...

220
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,629
The shadow of the fire
will illuminate the Village...

221
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,904
And once more the Leaf will sprout ...

222
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,147
A cycle of hardship, right?

223
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,152
Inside, we were crying, right?

224
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:24,701
But the one thing we won't give up

225
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,328
is the dream we've chosen, right?

226
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,456
It's a secondary role,

227
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,212
a role in the shadows

228
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:41,551
But in reaching for that dream,

229
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,137
let us stay centered,

230
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay true

231
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:54,480
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

232
00:21:54,564 --> 00:22:00,194
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

233
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,441
Lord Third Hokage...

234
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,944
The ambition that you had
seems to have been passed on

235
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:46,908
to the young Shinobi
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

236
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,371
The flame in their hearts will
burn large and strong in the future.

237
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,459
And someday,
they will illuminate this Village...

238
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,795
just as you have done for us!

239
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,633
Next time:
"The Third Hokage, Forever..."
