1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,583
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,504
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,764
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,603
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,075
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,263
I'm exhausted!

16
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,933
Important solo mission, my butt!

17
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,603
They just didn't have enough manpower
for the castle restoration.

18
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,523
That's not the job of a Shinobi.

19
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,904
Ow-ow... I won't hold up if
I don't rest somewhere.

20
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,408
Oh!

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,537
I'll take a bath.
Here I go!

22
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,207
Hey...
I'm sounding like an old man.

23
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,793
Wh-What?!

24
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,638
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

25
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,616
Thank you.

26
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,038
Who the heck are you, mister?

27
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,707
I'm a Delivery Ninja!

28
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,253
Please, Mr. Postman!

29
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,800
23, 24, 25...

30
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,302
26...

31
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,178
No mistake...

32
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,849
Thanks to you Mister Naruto,
all of the postal articles are safe.

33
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,477
By the way, what's a Delivery Ninja?

34
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,481
We are postal professionals
who risk our lives

35
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,484
to deliver the important parcels
our customers have left with us.

36
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,028
In other words, you're a postman.

37
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,613
I am a Delivery Ninja!

38
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,741
Ordinary postmen don't risk their lives.

39
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,243
So you're an awesome postman, huh?

40
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,703
That's right.

41
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,957
Oops, I must not keep
my customers waiting.

42
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,709
Then, I'll be on my way...

43
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,338
Mister! What's your name?!

44
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,715
I'm 596-03.

45
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,509
A zip code...?!

46
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,353
Anywhere would be fine
if I can get in a hot spring...

47
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,982
Cripes...
Here it's still day time and...

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,401
That voice...

49
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,322
My, you're a strange one, Jira-chan.

50
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,532
Am I?

51
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,785
Ah, Pervy Sage!

52
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,746
What?! Who's a Pervy Sage...?!

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,962
What's the meaning of this,
Pervy Sage?!

54
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,674
Hadn't you left the village
on an important mission?

55
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,135
That's why I was being patient
about you training with me!

56
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,179
If you've got the free time to be
doing something like this,

57
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,431
help out with my training right now!

58
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,601
W-Wait, Naruto.
There's a reason for this...

59
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,229
You probably have some glib lies
about gathering information or something.

60
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,357
You're wrong, you're wrong.
It's data collection, data collection...

61
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,025
You see...

62
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,403
It's my final spurt

63
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,697
for the manuscript of the final volume
of "Make-Out Violence."

64
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,782
What about the mission...?

65
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,160
Well, you see, I'm on a mission.

66
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,454
So don't worry...

67
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,665
What kind of mission?

68
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,838
As it happens, I received information
that a member of the Akatsuki Organization

69
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,633
will be visiting this town
the day after tomorrow.

70
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,970
The Akatsuki Organization!
Then, that Itachi will be...?

71
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:07,307
I don't know that.
And the same goes for their purpose...

72
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,811
But that's a matter until
the day after tomorrow.

73
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,857
And so, I'm making effective use
of the free time!

74
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,861
Then it's perfect.
Give me some training!

75
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,698
Well... you see, they're so insistent
about the manuscript.

76
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:28,620
I ended up promising the publisher
that I'd send it today or tomorrow.

77
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,999
Come on! It's a long-awaited chance
for training.

78
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,626
If my manuscript were
to be completed early,

79
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,087
I might be able to take
some time for training.

80
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,556
Oh, my shoulders are stiff!

81
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,640
There, there.

82
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,020
Oh, I'm thirsty!

83
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,731
Here you go.

84
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,860
Hot!

85
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,572
Hey, the ideas I just about had
have blown away!

86
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,074
Enough!

87
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,450
I'm taking a bath!

88
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,331
What a hard Sensei to please...

89
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,128
I bet he's going to say
this is data collection, anyway.

90
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,632
We must deliver that secret document

91
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,717
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs,
no matter what the cost...

92
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,053
It seems this is where
the Delivery Ninjas always stay.

93
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,347
Oh, they could...

94
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,307
Delivery Ninja?

95
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,977
I can see them now.

96
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,898
This is all I need for
my writing desire to well up...

97
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,489
I'm not getting...inspired with this...

98
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,200
Imagining with your head
is a writer's job, isn't it?

99
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:53,622
I'm a writer rooted in realism!
Getting a picture is important.

100
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,624
So I wonder if you'd do that for me.

101
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,292
Can you write if I do that?

102
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,002
I'll write, I'll write!

103
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,840
Sexy Jutsu:
Steam Bath Harem Version!

104
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,223
– Master Jiraiya. Jiraiya!
– This is great!

105
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,601
Won-der-ful!

106
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,737
What a hopeless guy!

107
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,077
He hasn't been able to write at all!

108
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,140
Address, check!
Zip code, check...!

109
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,772
Ow-ow-ow...

110
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,524
Oh, the sealed documents...

111
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,780
Please take extra care with this.

112
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,741
I will take it for you.

113
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,453
Ow-ow-ow...

114
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,708
Excuse me, can I also ask you
to take this for me?

115
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,462
Oh! Mister Naruto.
Thank you for helping me out yesterday.

116
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,214
Oh! Mister!

117
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,719
I am 596-03.

118
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,931
It's hard to remember!

119
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,725
More importantly, I want to ask you
to take care of this!

120
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,021
Hmm...This goes in a different direction...

121
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,565
Have a heart. Please.

122
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,734
Oh, perfect timing.

123
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,153
Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?

124
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,156
He is 463-72.

125
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,868
This area should be in your jurisdiction.

126
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,703
It is.

127
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,667
Then I leave it to you...
What was it again?

128
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,086
I am 463-72.

129
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,171
Hurry, okay?

130
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,218
Wake up...

131
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,720
Whoa! I fell asleep!

132
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,014
Pervy Sage, let's start training!

133
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,227
What're you talking about?
I must complete the manuscript...

134
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,689
You don't need to worry
about that.

135
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,944
I wrote the manuscript and
sent it to the publisher!

136
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,281
So now you can devote
yourself freely to training...

137
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,448
Right, Pervy Sage?

138
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,866
You idiot!

139
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,034
Huh?

140
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,329
If something like this were read,
it'll be the end of my writing career!

141
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,457
Ah... Oh... I'm sorry.

142
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,836
You said you sent it to
the publisher, right? How?

143
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,797
I gave it to a Delivery Ninja
in the inn...

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,341
D-Delivery Ninjas.

145
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,638
You mean, the one that delivers any
parcel to the addressee, no matter what...

146
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:01,059
not influenced by any land or institution...
that iron organization?!

147
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,937
After him, Naruto.

148
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,647
We'll chase down the Delivery Ninja,
no matter what...

149
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,151
and retrieve your manuscript
at any cost!

150
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,832
If he's going to the publisher,
he should definitely take this path.

151
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,918
Now what's left is how to
close the time gap...

152
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,297
I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas
is extraordinary, though...

153
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,591
Pervy Sage!

154
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,344
Slow down the pace a little, man.

155
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
Naruto! This is also training!

156
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,599
To be straight, you're short on leg power!

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,393
A Ninja must apply oneself,

158
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,772
connecting this with training,
no matter what the situation!

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,817
Excellent, Pervy Sage.
Now you're talking!

160
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,824
It's just like a maze!

161
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,077
We're totally lost...

162
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,955
If we had Hinata's or Neji's Byakugan
at a time like this...

163
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,416
Byakugan! I didn't think of that!

164
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,796
That's the Rasengan, isn't it?!

165
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,270
I'm sorry!

166
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,439
Uh, no, you see...!

167
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,111
This isn't the time to be drooling!

168
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,571
There he is!
After him, Naruto.

169
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,073
R-Right!

170
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,372
Thieves!

171
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,082
Hey, wait!

172
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,835
There's no fool who'd wait
after being told to wait!

173
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,086
As it happens,

174
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,798
the parcel this person here
left with you this morning is a slip-up!

175
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,675
That's right!

176
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,718
I have no knowledge of that.

177
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,637
The rule for us Delivery Ninjas

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,514
is to deliver parcels once left
with us to the destination,

179
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,391
even if we have to risk our lives!

180
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,643
My life as a writer is also at risk!

181
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
Don't look at me.

182
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,271
This is trouble!

183
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,273
Sorry.

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,242
To do that to someone
who's doing honest work...

185
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,870
Shut up! When you get right down to it,
it was you who...

186
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,873
Huh?! What's this?!

187
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,084
This isn't the thing you wrote!

188
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,419
Oh!

189
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,841
That time! It got switched with
my manuscript!

190
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,301
Say what?!

191
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,803
This is...a secret document directed

192
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,222
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs
from the Land of Claws...

193
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,434
Let me see...
According to the information I've gotten,

194
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:52,564
the Fang and the Claw could go
to war at any moment...

195
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,525
This is a secret document for peace!

196
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,404
They've decided on peace?!
It's written here.

197
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,657
That's a good thing, isn't it?!
War is no good!

198
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,995
You! You idiot! The fact that
this secret document is here means

199
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,374
the manuscript you wrote is being taken
to the Land of Fangs!

200
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,669
What'll happen if they read it as
a secret document

201
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,004
from the Land of Claws?

202
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,549
This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!

203
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,343
We're going to the Land of Fangs!

204
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,969
R-Right!

205
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,805
This time for sure we'll take back
the manuscript!

206
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:36,566
Postal thieves...
my customer's important parcel...!

207
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,991
This is bad!

208
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:51,289
This is 463-72. This is 463-72!

209
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,416
A postal robbery has occurred!

210
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,002
The thieves are a pair,

211
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,379
a large man with a perverted look
and a kid!

212
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:03,009
"They appear to be after 596-03's parcel."

213
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,681
"Members in the area are assigned
to protect 596-03!"

214
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,101
"Stop the thieves in the name
of the Delivery Ninja!"

215
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,528
The only way to get to the Land of Fangs
is to go up this river.

216
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,030
More than likely they will also go
by boat.

217
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,867
Then depending on our speed,
there's a chance we'll catch up.

218
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,579
I'm the one who's got it rough.

219
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,455
You don't have enough physical strength!

220
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,292
Consider this also as training
and apply yourself!

221
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,544
That again?!

222
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,809
Who're those guys?!

223
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,853
It appears reinforcements
have been summoned.

224
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,979
Hurry, Naruto!

225
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,163
Naruto! Switch places!

226
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,008
Rasengan!

227
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,803
Rasengan!

228
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,683
Somehow...the Rasengan looks like
a really cheap Jutsu...

229
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,560
It's for the sake of preventing a war!

230
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,688
Our mission of peace is at stake!

231
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,274
– Right!
– Switch.

232
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,734
Huh?

233
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,154
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

234
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:50,909
Rasengan!

235
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,329
Rasengan!

236
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,499
Rasengan!

237
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,834
That's it!

238
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,505
Hey, wait! It's a slip-up!
This is the real one!

239
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,675
They got switched during the commission!

240
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,512
Delivery Ninja old man,
it's the truth!

241
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,889
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,059
According to our rule,
we are never to look inside

243
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,937
a customer's parcel we have taken on,
no matter what.

244
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,272
If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,

245
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,816
there will be war!

246
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:27,320
Even if that were the case,
I must not break the rule.

247
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,155
You're impossible!

248
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,825
It's the Land of Fangs!

249
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,667
All we do is carry out our duties!

250
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,170
Then...we'll take it away
by force if we have to.

251
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,092
– Postal delivery!
– Postal delivery!

252
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,177
Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!

253
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,304
No, I don't!

254
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,392
I am 596-03.

255
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,895
I know! It's 596-03!

256
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,857
Where is he?!

257
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,486
Up there!

258
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,285
Naruto, you hold back the front!
I'll rout the rest!

259
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,745
Got it!

260
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,756
I won't let you go past here!

261
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,261
In the name of the Delivery Ninja,

262
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,473
I will not let anyone interfere!

263
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,767
You're an impressive old man...

264
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,394
I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,

265
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,772
will take away the manuscript
with a Jutsu!

266
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,815
Let's go!

267
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,985
Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!

268
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,783
Mis-ter De-li-very Nin-ja.

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,341
No, no! This isn't the time to be
doing something like this.

270
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,677
Now, to get cracking with my delivery.

271
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,560
Deliver...

272
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,980
I will deliver.

273
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:31,277
Hey, where are you going?
Play with me.

274
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,156
No, no! Not that way.

275
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,368
I'll do my best!

276
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,995
Guys! Give me a hand!

277
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,872
– Right! Yeah.
– Okay!

278
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,352
P-P-Postal delivery.

279
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,896
Okay, good work.

280
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,828
This guy's iron will is the real deal...

281
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,461
We're too late, huh...?

282
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,839
Is war going to start?!

283
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,222
Th-This is...!

284
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,601
It's a manuscript of the latest issue
of the Make-Out series!

285
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,314
That Land of Claws feudal lord...!

286
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:54,152
To think he'd know I was a big fan
of the Make-Out series!

287
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,029
Everyone!

288
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,739
Stop the fighting!

289
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,116
Send a messenger to
the Land of Claws!

290
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,121
Don't let anybody in...

291
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,208
I kind of don't really get it, but...
with this, there'll be no war?

292
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,628
No war is fine...

293
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:16,257
But does this mean my writing power
is the same as Naruto's scribbling...?!

294
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,058
Now then!

295
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,603
Today's the day the Akatsuki Organization
guy comes!

296
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,481
We'll capture him no matter what
and get information about Sasuke...

297
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,399
Pervy Sage?

298
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,949
Sorry, Naruto. There was a development
while you were sleeping.

299
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,326
I will pursue
the Akatsuki Organization as is.

300
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,290
I've been had!

301
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,760
Well... I suppose it made for
some good training...

302
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,738
The wind blows, Ah...

303
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,575
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

304
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,995
What should be brought along?

305
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,998
Assemble them into a piece.

306
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,085
There is no second chance, never

307
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,754
How foolish it is to throw away

308
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,882
Acting so innocently, Ah...

309
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,676
The images.

310
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,891
It probably will not end

311
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,273
It probably will not end

312
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,944
Burn that love-filled heart,

313
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,197
Sail across a thousand dreams

314
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,075
Running freely

315
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

316
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,790
The clouds scatter

317
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,877
The sun sets yet again

318
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:22,508
The solo parade begins to move.

319
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

320
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,265
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

321
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,734
-All right, everyone, follow me.
-Wait.

322
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,903
We're heading for
the Village Hidden in Stars

323
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,155
on a mission to protect
a mysterious star.

324
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,239
Naruto!

325
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,783
Man, I'm getting fired up.

326
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,785
We all need to work together here.

327
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,746
Now, let's all unite and show
the boundless power of the Leaf.

328
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,708
Hey, don't be following us like
it's matter of course, Naruto.

329
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,877
You're not listed as
a member for this mission.

330
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time:
"Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name"
