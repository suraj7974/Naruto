1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:38,914
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,308
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,936
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,060
This is as far as you go.
Give Matsuri back.

15
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,021
You think you've got me cornered now?

16
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,110
Don't get the wrong idea.
You're the one who's been cornered!

17
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,195
What?

18
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,406
Byakugan!

19
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,371
He has the final enemy cornered
in a dead-end valley.

20
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,584
The area around the valley
is eerily calm.

21
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,878
I don't see his comrades.

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,841
Is Shikamaru's final move finished?

23
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,968
No.

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,804
We can't state definitively that
they've reached a deadlock.

25
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,767
It's because it's possible that
the battles thus far were diversions.

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,443
Just a little more, Lee.

27
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,405
It'll be over once I connect
two or three more muscles.

28
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,827
Sakura's Medical Ninja technique
is really becoming...

29
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,454
And yet I...

30
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:51,088
The treatment is over for now.
How do you fight to get like this?

31
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,007
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,552
You saved me.
Thank you, Sakura.

33
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,512
You're welcome.

34
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,848
Oh, you can't, yet.

35
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,436
As one of the Medical Team members,
I prohibit you from fighting any further.

36
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,479
No, please let me go.

37
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,108
I can't just leave Gaara like this...

38
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,320
We're Team Return-the-Favor, after all.

39
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:19,199
The Ultimate Weapon Reborn

40
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,954
Gaara, you may very well be
called the ultimate weapon,

41
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,833
but have you not used up all of
your sand in the fight earlier?

42
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,296
This is my weapon.

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,218
Indeed I have used up almost all
of the sand with Chakra built up inside.

44
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,970
But...

45
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:45,935
No matter what Jutsu you use,
I must not lose in a one-on-one battle.

46
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,730
There's nothing scary about
a Shinobi with no weapon!

47
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,904
Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!

48
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,293
Fang Release: Dark Sword!
Flying Double Edge Sword!

49
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,429
You'll realize that the likes
of a mere Ninja

50
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,849
is no match for the Ninja tools
created by us artisans.

51
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,076
Fang Release: Dark Sword!

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,587
It seems your own body's Chakra
has run out.

53
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,466
You're carrying
a monster inside you, right?

54
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:06,098
Now, isn't it about time
you used the power of Shukaku?

55
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,827
You okay?

56
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,037
Gaara Sensei is...

57
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,456
Yeah, I know.

58
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,835
Listen up.
You hide in a safe place somewhere.

59
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,919
Right.

60
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:40,507
Although Gaara received
Sakura's treatment, he's still...

61
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:51,351
That's as far as you go,
ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!

62
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,438
Damn it.

63
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,024
Use the power of the Shukaku already.

64
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,358
Hey!

65
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,568
Hold it!

66
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,488
Who are you?

67
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,784
I'll be your opponent from here on.

68
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,368
You're in the way, boy.

69
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,412
Kujaku Hurricane!

70
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,795
Damn it!

71
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,380
Leaf Shinobi, you watch.

72
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,592
The era of control by
the Five Great Nations will end.

73
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,469
No, it won't be just that.

74
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,307
If the ultimate Ninja tool created by
the Artisan Village is completed,

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,770
the existence of the Ninja
will no longer be necessary.

76
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,523
What're you talking about?!

77
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,442
We are people from the Village
of Artisans who for many years

78
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,237
have equally shared
exceptional Ninja tools

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,114
with you in the Five Great Nations.

80
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,700
However, each time relations
worsened between fellow villages,

81
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,370
the Village of Artisans would be attacked

82
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,956
over fear of Ninja tools crossing
over to the other village.

83
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,625
You Ninja of the Five Great Nations
have forgotten

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,503
that you are kept alive by our power,

85
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,005
and have returned the favor
with vengeance time and again.

86
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,676
Although we the people of
the Village of Artisans have advanced skills,

87
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,972
we have had to survive by currying favor
from the Five Great Nations!

88
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,767
However, that era will now end!

89
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,436
First, I will take out the Leaf Village.

90
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,147
Fang Release Dark Sword!

91
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,819
How long can you run away for?

92
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,787
I'll stake you like a shrike!

93
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,127
What?!

94
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,427
You!

95
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,928
Gaara Sensei!

96
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,142
Gaara Sensei's sand
protected the Leaf Ninja.

97
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,398
That dome created with hard minerals
in the ground mixed with sand...

98
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,068
can't be smashed by such junk.

99
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,988
I'll protect him until the end...

100
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
with my power!

101
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,285
Gaara Sensei!

102
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,078
Don't make me laugh!

103
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,875
You, who are called the greatest creation
of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,

104
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
are going to protect someone else?

105
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,046
And you're going to use
what little Chakra you have left

106
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,881
for the sake of a comrade?

107
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,052
But that will be your death!

108
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,603
Gaara Sensei!

109
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,231
With this,
all preparations are complete.

110
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,191
Damn it.

111
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,656
Oh!

112
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,663
Gaara!

113
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,084
We were contacted by someone
from the Village of Artisans.

114
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,878
It seems ones calling themselves
the Four Celestials,

115
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,547
bearing long-withstanding hostilities
against the Five Great Nations...

116
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,385
have completed forbidden research and
are attempting to resurrect

117
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,762
the ultimate weapon of folklore
in the village.

118
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,015
It seems the villagers got
wind of the crisis

119
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,226
and have evacuated to
a different location.

120
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,230
I see. So that's why the village
was completely empty.

121
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,150
So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?

122
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,613
The resurrection of Seimei,
the founder of the Village of Artisans.

123
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:32,698
Seimei?!

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,450
Are you saying
they're trying to raise the dead?!

125
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,205
I see. It makes sense that
the mausoleum was violated.

126
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,583
As for us, we must prevent
the resurrection

127
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,669
of the ultimate weapon at all costs.

128
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,963
I understand. I'll be off.

129
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,341
Oh, hold on.
Yes?

130
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,553
I'll be having one more person
accompany you on this mission.

131
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,763
What? Who would that be?

132
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,981
What we wanted was
the Shukaku's Chakra.

133
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,191
What did you say?

134
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,527
How we've waited for this time.

135
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,239
Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.

136
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,908
And infuse me with that power.

137
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,993
Gaara!

138
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,746
I'll save you now.

139
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,955
Naruto!

140
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,876
Matsuri, take this.

141
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,090
My rope javelin.

142
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,771
The optic nerves have connected...

143
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,357
Open...

144
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,233
third eye!

145
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,073
Hey, you.

146
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,785
What the heck do you intend to start?

147
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,286
I'll show you.

148
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,997
The ultimate Ninja tool created
by Lord Seimei,

149
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,125
the founder of our Village of Artisans.

150
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,044
Ultimate Ninja tool?

151
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,839
Now is the time of its completion.

152
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,360
Gaara!

153
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,838
Oh, Lord Seimei.

154
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:57,717
Please take possession of my flesh
and complete your resurrection!

155
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,307
Oh!

156
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,200
What's going on? He vanished.

157
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,760
The dead body came back to life!

158
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,142
My name is Seimei.
The founder of the Village of Artisans.

159
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,021
A hundred years have passed and

160
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,732
I have now been resurrected
as the ultimate Ninja tool

161
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,108
of the Village of Artisans!

162
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,286
What in the world is happening here?!

163
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,468
My long-awaited wish has at last
come to fruition.

164
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,473
With this, my Village of Artisans will reign
over the Shinobi apex.

165
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,725
I see...

166
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,396
So the monster from the Sand Village
became the source of my power.

167
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,398
Say what?

168
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,776
Hoko said this.

169
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,612
There is a monster lying
within the body

170
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,114
of the one called Gaara
from the Sand Village.

171
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,200
Once that person is in a cage,

172
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,578
soon he will become
a complete monster, the Shukaku.

173
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,043
I will take away what you could
consider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.

174
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,796
I won't let you do that!

175
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,700
Damn it!

176
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,085
Just wait, Gaara.
I'll get you out now.

177
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,590
What a waste...

178
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,633
Vortex Wind.

179
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,141
I'm just getting started!

180
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,642
What a fool!

181
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,694
I'll get you out now!

182
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,947
Damn it, damn it!

183
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,076
Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!

184
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,914
Gaara, answer me!
What's going on in there?!

185
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,292
Gaara!
Gaara!

186
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,260
N-Naruto...

187
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,364
Shikamaru!

188
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,490
What?

189
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,284
Where are Gaara and Naruto?

190
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,579
Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.

191
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,999
There's a cage behind an area
surrounded by rocks...

192
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,045
There's a massive amount of Chakra
being extracted from there.

193
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,922
Gaara must be inside.

194
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,715
Hey, Shikamaru!

195
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,927
What?

196
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,556
You know there's a terrifying power
lying dormant inside Gaara, right?

197
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,975
Yeah, generally.

198
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,687
Something terrible will happen...

199
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,566
if Gaara has Chakra extracted like this
and he loses himself!

200
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,569
The Shukaku that had been kept
under control will go out of control.

201
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,739
Once it starts going berserk,
there will be no way to stop Gaara.

202
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,825
For real?

203
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,704
I must not waste any more time.

204
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,789
The entertainment ends here.

205
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,547
Hot-hot-hot-hot.

206
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,676
Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!

207
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,261
I'll get you out now!

208
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,556
You're a pest!

209
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,891
Give it up already!

210
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,565
I'm just getting started!

211
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,866
Solid Blanks!

212
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:36,681
Oh, how I have waited for this time.

213
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,269
Now, Shukaku! Give me power!

214
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,698
I feel it. This is an amazing power!

215
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,015
Cut out the futile resistance.

216
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,393
The power of the Shukaku
is already mine!

217
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,230
I declare war on the Five Great Nations.

218
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,735
The Shinobi in the Five Great Nations
who made light of the Artisan Shinobi

219
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,448
will fully realize the 100-year grudge
of the Artisan Ninja.

220
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,619
And they will inevitably
become our sacrifices.

221
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,079
Knock it off!

222
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,288
What?!

223
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:47,669
We won't hand over our power
to the likes of you.

224
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,465
I won't let you take away any more
of Gaara's Chakra.

225
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,633
You got that?!

226
00:18:55,969 --> 00:19:00,682
How can that person fight
while getting that beaten up?

227
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,769
Why do you go this far, kid?

228
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,315
What is the monster of
the Sand Village to you?

229
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,441
Gaara...

230
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,572
Gaara is an important comrade to me!

231
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:21,035
He said he fights for
those important to him.

232
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,374
Fights for someone important.

233
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,920
Very well. Then die!

234
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,474
What're you doing, little girl?

235
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,937
I finally figured out what
Gaara Sensei taught me.

236
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,649
Weapons took away the lives
of my mother and father.

237
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,403
But I can also protect those important
to me with a weapon!

238
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,323
Foolishness.

239
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,208
Damn it!

240
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,633
It has finally begun, huh...?

241
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,688
Gaara Sensei...

242
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,949
Gaara!

243
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,465
Gaara.

244
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,186
The Key to the rusted heart's door

245
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:16,025
Will always be smiling right near by

246
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,452
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

247
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:31,124
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

248
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,837
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

249
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,633
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

250
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,388
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

251
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:50,059
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

252
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:54,480
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

253
00:21:54,564 --> 00:22:01,487
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

254
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:06,034
The wind is probably testing our hearts

255
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,705
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

256
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,126
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

257
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:20,256
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

258
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,802
The Key to the rusted heart's door

259
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:30,183
Will always be smiling right near by

260
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,317
Hey, that's...

261
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,319
– We were too late.
– Then, you mean...

262
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,321
Yes. He is starting to transform
to Shukaku.

263
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,655
Damn! What should we do?

264
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,034
This is bad.
If Gaara loses his conscious in that state,

265
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,994
the true Shukaku will come out.

266
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,038
When that happens
he won't know a foe from friend,

267
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,165
he will just destroy everything.

268
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,794
All we can do is just stand here
and watch?!

269
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,090
Next time: "Departure"
