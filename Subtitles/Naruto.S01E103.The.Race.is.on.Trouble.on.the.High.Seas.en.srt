1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,686
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,669
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:49,884
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,051
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,819
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,406
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,713
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,936
What should we do, Aoi?

22
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,939
I'll go with Fukusuke.

23
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,982
You go after Idate.

24
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,442
-Right!
-Right!

25
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,531
Hey, Idate!
The ocean is that way!

26
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,492
Where are you going!
Come back!

27
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,078
There's no way
I'm going back!

28
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,631
-Let's go!
-Right!

29
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,929
What does that kid think
he's doing?

30
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,100
Looks like he's run away.

31
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,103
Idate's been like that
from long ago.

32
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,521
You know him?

33
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,814
Yes, kind of...

34
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,909
The Race is On!
Trouble on the High Seas!

35
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,499
I knew he'd run away,
that bastard Idate.

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,920
Knowing him this long,
you must've figured this would happen.

37
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,965
It was a mistake to let him run!

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,051
You idiots!
Idate isn't that kind of kid!

39
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,887
-Boss!
-Boss...

40
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,763
I believe in Idate.

41
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,267
He must have a plan.

42
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,644
Jirocho!

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,605
Chief Retainer!

44
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,983
How do you think
you're going to settle this?

45
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,240
You've turned this grand traditional
festival into a mere farce...

46
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,409
And worse,
in the presence of the lord!

47
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:27,625
Sir, the race has just begun.
Please watch it until the end.

48
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:38,719
Since you insist that much,
you had better win.

49
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,472
If you lose...

50
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,436
I'll ask for the dissolution
of your family!

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,856
Agreed! I'm a man of my word.

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,402
If Idate loses,
you may do anything you wish.

53
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:03,327
How like Wasabi's Jirocho.
Such confidence.

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,704
Don't let us down.

55
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,335
I'm counting on you, Idate.

56
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,301
Boss...

57
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,263
Give me your money!

58
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,356
Just be still!

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,608
A starving thief, huh...

60
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,568
Sh-Shut up!

61
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,408
A kid trying to act tough!

62
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,621
With that little thing,

63
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,498
you can't even peel an apple,
can you?!

64
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,791
Here!

65
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,715
Take this.

66
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:02,594
Edged tools aren't
for hurting people.

67
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,018
You don't have anywhere to go,
do you?

68
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,482
I'm Jirocho of Wasabi
of Degarashi Port.

69
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,694
Wasabi...Jirocho?

70
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,488
How about it?
Why don't you come to my place?

71
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,659
I-I just tried to...

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,747
Anyone on the verge of starvation
will make such mistakes...

73
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,623
I don't hold it against you.

74
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,628
Ah...this...

75
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,965
I gave it to you.
Keep it.

76
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,179
Don't ever do stupid things
like stealing...

77
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,184
M-Mister!

78
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,021
Listen!
Make me your henchman!

79
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,565
No, I mean...
could you please, Boss!

80
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,319
-What's your name?
-Idate...

81
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,820
My name is Idate Morino.

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,829
Shall we go then, Idate?

83
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,918
Boss, just trust in me!
I will win, no matter what!

84
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,301
We can catch up
to him in a bit!

85
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,053
But it's too late now!

86
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,680
He can't win if
he's this far from the port!

87
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,893
No, he may've planned to come
this way from the very beginning.

88
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,354
-What?
-Huh?

89
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,160
How lucky!

90
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,664
Now, we can stop them here.

91
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,169
At any rate...

92
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,464
who would've thought
they'd be escorting him.

93
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,885
Double Lucky!
Now I can pay them back.

94
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,974
For what they did to us
during the Chunin Exams.

95
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,771
You two go ahead.
I'll keep them here.

96
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,648
All right!

97
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,027
Finally, we've caught up to you!

98
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,863
Hey, wait!

99
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,615
Geez! Why on earth
did you come this way?!

100
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,993
Shut up!
It's none of your business!

101
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,120
What kinda attitude is that?!

102
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,746
I said to shut up!

103
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,918
Watch out!

104
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,338
-They aren't aware of it, are they?
-Of Genjutsu?

105
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,632
Hey, I said wait up!

106
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,303
I've already been here?

107
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,598
Darn! Looks like
I've been tricked by Genjutsu.

108
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,101
-Wha-?!
-If that's the case...

109
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,062
Release!

110
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,068
There!

111
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,320
H-Hey!

112
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,363
No! Don't go that way!

113
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,827
Huh? What's going on?

114
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,958
I'm out of it!

115
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,342
Just be still!

116
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,802
We'll get pulled up now!

117
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,263
That was close...

118
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,099
A double Genjutsu.

119
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,477
Pretty elaborate trick.

120
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,689
You idiot! It's your fault that
we're going through all this!

121
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,691
What did you say?!

122
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,902
Hey, stop! Stop, I said!

123
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,322
My Ninja tools!

124
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,287
That was an unnecessary help!

125
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,872
Did you say unnecessary?!

126
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,875
Hey bastard, can't you even
thank us for saving you?!

127
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,628
You saved me
because it's your duty!

128
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,129
No need to thank you!

129
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,173
What did you say?!

130
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,093
Stop, Naruto. He's right.

131
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:17,057
But if you don't want to die,
you should stay close to us.

132
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,476
Hey, where are you going?!

133
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,311
Aren't you going back
to Port Degarashi?

134
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,940
Stupid, I'm heading north from here!

135
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,362
-North? Is it faster that way?
-Yeah...

136
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,533
Who knows...
I really don't trust this guy!

137
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,786
-This is why Ninja are no good.
-What?!

138
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,997
At this time of year,

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,000
a strong seasonal wind blows
across this ocean...

140
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,421
At the starting point, I watched the clouds
and realized it...

141
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,923
That the wind was coming.

142
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,759
On top of that,
at the port to the north,

143
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,470
there's an ocean current
that flows straight to Nagi Island.

144
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,850
This part is different from you guys.
Right here!

145
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,776
Looks like it's getting a bit rough.

146
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,537
Hey, don't push it!

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,372
Head more towards the south!

148
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,458
But that'll take up quite some time.

149
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,086
Once we get on the land,
no one can run faster than I can.

150
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,838
My victory is already set!

151
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,256
All right...

152
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,473
I taste salt in the air.

153
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,060
It's the ocean!

154
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,443
What is it that far out on the ocean?

155
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,988
It's the halfway point ...
Nagi Island where Modoroki shrine is.

156
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,374
I can get there within an hour.
Wait for a sec.

157
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,756
Hey, old man, I'm here!
It's Idate from the Wasabi Family!

158
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,966
Ah, I've been waiting for you.

159
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,220
Looks like I was right.

160
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,389
I'll need you to lend me a boat.

161
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,141
I see. I have it ready.

162
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,684
Use that boat.

163
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,315
It's the fastest boat around here.

164
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,566
I'm grateful to you!

165
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,737
No problem. Boss Jirocho has done
so much for me.

166
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,408
So, don't lose to Wagarashi!

167
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,536
I'm fed up with how
they handle things.

168
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,621
Leave it to me!

169
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,997
I may be down on my luck now,

170
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,959
but I'm Idate, the number one
henchman of the Wasabi Family!

171
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,753
Rest easy and leave it all to me!

172
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,923
Yeah, right.

173
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,320
We should start seeing
Nagi Island's port soon.

174
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,240
I hope we can get there
before Fukusuke.

175
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,585
Hey, Naruto...
What do you think?

176
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,545
Hm? What about?

177
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,838
That Idate...

178
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,966
He's definitely not
an ordinary man.

179
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,390
He can run extraordinarily fast.

180
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,310
He could have received
special training...

181
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,062
What kind of training?

182
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,149
Like, maybe he'd been
in a hidden village.

183
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,237
A guy that stupid can't be a Ninja!

184
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,158
Who's talking here?!
You're as stupid as he is!

185
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,952
B-But...

186
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,206
I made it to the final round
of the Chunin Exam!

187
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,042
You were in the final round
of the Chunin Exam?!

188
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,668
Yeah, that' s right!

189
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,295
If I weren't interrupted
in the middle of it,

190
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,423
I could have won the tournament
and become a Chunin!

191
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,596
Then you must have had
a darn easy proctor.

192
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,601
Really, the level of
the Chunin Exam has dropped...

193
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,979
Idate, so you are...

194
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,067
I remember now!

195
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,318
Idate Morino.

196
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,321
Morino... That's right!

197
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,532
Wasn't the proctor
of the first test...?

198
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,993
Be quiet, you rotten runts!

199
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,540
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

200
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,086
I'm the proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.

201
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,963
My name is Morino Ibiki.

202
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,173
Morino... Ibiki...

203
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,217
What did you say?

204
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!

205
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,390
-Yes...
-Of course, he's alive!

206
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,768
He gave me a weird problem
on the 10th question...

207
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,812
Is that true?
He really is alive?!

208
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,440
Wh-What's this?!

209
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,609
An ambush!

210
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,702
How is it?

211
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,996
As you can see,
it's right in front of us.

212
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,456
Then, let's get started
on our plan!

213
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,268
Naruto and I will chase them away!

214
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,312
Sakura, take care of Idate!

215
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,438
Isn't it better to run...?

216
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,481
Too late for that!

217
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,157
I'll cover you. Remove the ropes!

218
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,533
Gotcha!

219
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,076
Darn! I have to cut these!

220
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,502
Darn it! I lost them all that time!

221
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,837
Hey, lend me that thing!

222
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,382
-What?!
-Just hand it to me, hurry!

223
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,595
Bastard, this is more important
than my life.

224
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,347
There's no way
I'll let you use it...

225
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,516
This is no time to be saying
stuff like that!

226
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,809
S-Stop you idiot!

227
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,355
Hurry up, you loser!

228
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,862
Heh, piece of cake!

229
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,160
Sakura! They are just clones!

230
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,664
Only the real one can attack you,
so don't worry!

231
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,875
Sharingan!

232
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,422
Sakura, Naruto!

233
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,550
The real ones are hiding among
the clones! Be careful!

234
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,428
Sasuke! Guide us!

235
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,555
Idate, stay close to me!

236
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,392
I don't want a Ninja's help!

237
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,645
Are you still saying that
in this situation?!

238
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,771
Naruto! Behind you!

239
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,485
Naruto!

240
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,156
A clone?!
Oh, shoot!

241
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,867
-Clone for clone!
-Clone for clone!

242
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,164
Damn, they got away.

243
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,541
Nice work! Naruto!

244
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,169
That Shadow Clone kid
is troublesome.

245
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,004
The next plan, Kagari!

246
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,007
We'll kill them all!

247
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,137
Water Style!
Black Rain Jutsu!

248
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,559
Sasuke! They've changed
into Water Clones!

249
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,311
I know!

250
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,444
Rain?

251
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,030
No! This is oil!

252
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,993
How annoying!
I'll get rid of them all at once!

253
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,536
That's Tiger Seal!

254
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,164
Sasuke, no!

255
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,209
Oops...

256
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,211
Unlucky...

257
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,299
not really.

258
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,386
Fire attack?!

259
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,032
B-Brother...

260
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,285
Go! Having you stay will be
a burden to me!

261
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,288
B-Brother...

262
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,708
Idate?

263
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,794
N-Nothing!

264
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,837
Sasuke, what can we do?!

265
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,464
If the fire is this strong...

266
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,469
We'll have to dive in
to the ocean!

267
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,971
From here, we can swim
to the port of Nagi Island!

268
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,307
Right! There's no other option left.

269
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,100
Idate, can you swim?

270
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,268
Y-Yeah...

271
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,026
Hurry! I'll cover you, so go first!

272
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,321
This smoke should help you
escape unnoticed!

273
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,406
Idate?!

274
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,283
-There's no way!
-Wha...?

275
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,204
You are tricking me into
becoming a decoy!

276
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,580
What are you talking about?!

277
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,334
You're trying to get
the enemy's attention to me!

278
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,669
That's nonsense!

279
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,587
No! I don't trust Ninja!

280
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,506
What are you doing? Go!

281
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,383
Having you stay will be
a burden to us!

282
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,473
Go! Having you stay
is a burden!

283
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,852
Hurry up and go!

284
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,479
There's no way we will
use you as a decoy!

285
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,441
N-No...

286
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,616
Cha!

287
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,288
Idate! Duck down!

288
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,341
Trust me Idate!
I promise I'll protect you!

289
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,763
Watch out!

290
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,559
Sa...!

291
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,643
Sakura!

292
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,146
S-Sakura...

293
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,647
Go on ahead...

294
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,609
We'll follow you right after!

295
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,320
A-All right...

296
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,994
Well, shall we withdraw now?

297
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,331
Withdraw?

298
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,375
The most enjoyable part
is still left undone.

299
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,964
Darn, they are
unexpectedly tenacious.

300
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,801
Yeah. But we won't
let them get away.

301
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,863
I-I should be okay here...

302
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,792
Long time no see, Idate.

303
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,169
Y-You are...

304
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,883
I have taught you so many times
not to trust anyone.

305
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,429
Such a fool, you are...

306
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,186
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

307
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

308
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,821
On your still shoulder

309
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,534
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

310
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:30,456
The city lights are like pieces of stars

311
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

312
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,799
"Each one of us

313
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,512
glows differently,"

314
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,432
you say laughingly

315
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:53,604
but you look most dazzling

316
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:58,026
Like a comet,

317
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:04,240
like the rainbow after the storm

318
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,870
You bring light

319
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,372
into my heart

320
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost

321
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,966
can be the answer

322
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,220
Let's promise

323
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,266
we won't cheat

324
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,937
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

325
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,527
Fool or whatever...
