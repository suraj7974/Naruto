1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,486
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,128
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,006
Now

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,729
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,247
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,058
Ugh...what are you here for now?

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,729
It's our reunion after so long,
and you're awfully cold.

20
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,192
Don't tell me that you came to
assassinate Lord Hokage?

21
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,319
No, no...

22
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,280
I don't have enough
subordinates for that yet...

23
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,825
I've heard of the excellence ones
of this village

24
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,451
and thought I'd put dibs on them.

25
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:07,419
A little while ago, I gave that
same Curse Mark as a present.

26
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,048
There's a kid that I want.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,134
Selfish as always.

28
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,178
That kid will die.

29
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,264
Certainly...

30
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,225
The odds are 1 in 10
that he'll survive,

31
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,062
but he may survive just like you did.

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,816
This kid, you really like him, huh?

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,610
Are you jealous?

34
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:38,784
Are you still holding a grudge that
I used you and threw you away?

35
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,331
Unlike you, that kid will excel...

36
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:48,294
For one thing, he inherited
the Uchiha ability.

37
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,047
He has beautiful features

38
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,259
and is a vessel who
can become my heir.

39
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,430
If that kid lived,
it makes things interesting.

40
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,641
Be sure not to cancel this test.

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,023
Three from my village are also
under your care...

42
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,983
Make me enjoy it.

43
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,448
If something happens
to deprive me of my fun,

44
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,535
consider it the end of Leaf Village.

45
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,765
We've secured food and water
after spending half a day.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,352
And now most teams have halted activity.

47
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,272
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,525
We'll split up into three
and go scouting.

49
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,196
However, whether we find
other teams or not,

50
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,156
we return to this place.

51
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,326
Got it?

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,620
Okay.
Roger.

53
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,956
Okay. Scatter!

54
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,300
Bushy-Brow's Pledge:
Undying Love and Protection!

55
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,981
I can't fall asleep...

56
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,861
I need to protect these two.

57
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,166
I slept great!

58
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,500
Naruto!

59
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,129
Sasuke!

60
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,631
Did you take care of us?

61
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,300
Thank you, Sakura!

62
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,218
We're totally better because of you!

63
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,181
That's good...

64
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:58,108
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately

65
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,903
in front of the predator!

66
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,831
My voice is gone!

67
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,595
It was just a dream...

68
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,228
Is it daybreak already?!

69
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,356
No, no way!

70
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,789
A squirrel?

71
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't surprise me like that!

72
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh!

73
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,340
That was too close.

74
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,009
Do you think she noticed?

75
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,262
The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...

76
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,806
No, that's not it.

77
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,518
Huh? Then what? What was it?

78
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,187
We'll probably find out if we go closer.

79
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,817
So...we should get going now.

80
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,215
If I can catch all twenty of these leaves
before they hit the ground

81
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,343
Sakura will start to like me.

82
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,597
If...if I can't catch
even one of the leaves...!

83
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,350
It'll be an unanswered love forever.
Or rather...

84
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,394
You're too Bushy!

85
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,937
That's what she'll say.

86
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,901
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...

87
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,195
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

88
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:11,033
nine...!
Ugh, nineteen...

89
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,492
One more!

90
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,080
That's...!

91
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,631
Phew...just in time.

92
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,802
This is called a Paper Bomb
and it explodes after some time.

93
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,931
Who did such an awful thing?

94
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,024
Stop hiding and come out.

95
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,569
Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!

96
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,740
Man, he's a damn pain
and we've been discovered!

97
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,827
Strategy One, "hide and let it pass,"
was a failure!

98
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,664
So now we carry out Strategy Two!

99
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,750
Huh? Are you serious?

100
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,294
What? You have a problem with that?

101
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,630
There's no question of success.

102
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,092
Well, I guess it's all right but...

103
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:16,890
Wow! To meet last year's Number One
rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!

104
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,476
C-Can I have your autograph?

105
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,186
So it's just you guys?

106
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,691
Take that! Strategy Two, "head over heals
infatuation with my sex appeal"!

107
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:32,155
I'd been wanting to meet you
for some time, you know?

108
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,323
Get lost!

109
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,122
Why? Why doesn't my sexiness work?!

110
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,625
Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!

111
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:50,465
Did you just raise your fists to me,
and does that mean you want to fight?

112
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,803
N-No...
Of course not.

113
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,347
Then get lost.

114
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,976
Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps
like you

115
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,395
would only make me
the laughing stock of the village.

116
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,605
Y-Yes!

117
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,443
Huh... Really just like cockroaches.

118
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,575
Just as I thought.

119
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:21,371
A fellow like that wouldn't take
a scroll away from wimps like us

120
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,582
unless we were to turn on him.

121
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,544
All right! Let's go find some wimps!

122
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,465
Like I've been saying
there's no one wimpier than us...

123
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,562
So a no-sleep lookout?

124
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,816
But it's not necessary anymore.

125
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,280
Wake Sasuke up.
We want to battle with him.

126
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,491
Y-You bastards...

127
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,912
What're you saying?

128
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,830
What is it you're after?

129
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,042
I know the one called Orochimaru
is calling the shots from the shadows!

130
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,210
Huh?!

131
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,546
What's that strange bruise on
the back of Sasuke's neck?

132
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,049
You did this to Sasuke.

133
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,634
How can you say you want to fight him?!

134
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:21,348
I wonder...what he has on his mind?

135
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,978
However, I can't stay quiet
after hearing that.

136
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:31,066
I will kill this girl,
I'll also kill this Sasuke character.

137
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,697
Wait, Zaku.

138
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,199
Huh? What is it?

139
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,454
It's so cliché.

140
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,958
It's the color of dirt
that's just been dug up.

141
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,253
This grass, it doesn't grow in
a place like this, does it?

142
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,462
Darn!

143
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,132
You know, with a trap...

144
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,093
there's no point unless you
make it so it's not discovered.

145
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,931
Huh, how ridiculous!

146
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,893
So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel
wouldn't be caught in the trap?

147
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,521
We kill her now!

148
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,443
A log?!

149
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,028
A trap above too? Watch out!

150
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,197
Just kidding.

151
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,451
What?!

152
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,745
Clearly you have no talent.

153
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,875
Someone like you needs to
make more of an effort or else!

154
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,919
Leaf Hurricanes!

155
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,844
What?! This guy...

156
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,848
Then you also should...make an effort!

157
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,975
Who are you?

158
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:51,646
I'm the beautiful blue beast
of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!

159
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,453
Why are you here?

160
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,996
I will always appear...

161
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,750
whenever you're in trouble!

162
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,754
Or should I say...

163
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:20,008
It was really because of you,
now run along.

164
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,726
But right now, I'm also
your enemy!

165
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,145
I did say this once before, didn't I?

166
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,316
That I'll protect you until I die.

167
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,738
Please go out with me!

168
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,407
I'll protect you until I die!

169
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,661
Oh...

170
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,704
T-Thanks.

171
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,997
Yes!

172
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,626
Perfect! I did it!
Gu Sensei, that was perfect!

173
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,631
I guess it can't be helped...

174
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,593
Zaku. I'll give you Sasuke.

175
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,930
I will kill them!

176
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:11,560
As far as I can tell,
Sakura is in no condition to fight.

177
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,189
That Bushy-Brow guy is
pretty proficient with Taijutsu...

178
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,024
Looks like I can have some fun!

179
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,454
There is a trick to your attack,
isn't there?

180
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,290
I won't just simply avoid it.

181
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,002
You showed me your Jutsu before.

182
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,924
This guy...he's strong.

183
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,384
Having said that,

184
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,511
the odds aren't good since
it's one versus three.

185
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,638
I'm gonna have to take a chance.

186
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,934
One person at a time...

187
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,728
I'll give it my all and take each down!

188
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,199
There's no one at all that seems wimpy!

189
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:13,913
Well, the only team that's weaker
than us is the Naruto team.

190
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,999
Idiot! You know what you're saying?

191
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,083
What?!

192
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,461
No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!

193
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,172
But that team has
the super genius Sasuke!

194
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,883
Hah! I wonder...

195
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,637
In actual battle that genius
might easily be beaten.

196
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,263
What?!

197
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,143
All right, all right,
I apologize for irritating you.

198
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,521
What a pain...

199
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:43,652
I say one negative thing about
Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every time...

200
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,155
There's no way Sasuke
could be taken down!

201
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,824
Sakura's a different matter though!

202
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,830
Huh?!

203
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,833
Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...

204
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,795
Huh?!
...and Sakura is fighting.

205
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,213
What did you say?

206
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,594
Hey!

207
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,556
He's late.

208
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,183
That Lee...

209
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,394
Something's not right.

210
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,979
He's always precise about time.

211
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,233
Perhaps he ran into the enemy...

212
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,403
Could it be...?

213
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,280
Huh, that wouldn't have happened.

214
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,909
In any case, let's find Lee!

215
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
Right!

216
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,795
Yes! I've finally mastered it!
Yes! Yes!

217
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,800
My friends, there's no reason
to give up on your youth!

218
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,809
This Jutsu...

219
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,062
In the end, only Lee
could make it his own.

220
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,188
Yahoo!

221
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,524
– Hey Lee...
– I did it! I will do it!

222
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,192
– Lee!
– When I try! I try!

223
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,569
Hey, Lee!

224
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,406
Hey!

225
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,705
Listen to this passionate message
from your teacher!

226
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,623
Oh...what is it?!

227
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,667
Please tell me using hip words.

228
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,089
This Jutsu, the "Lotus"...

229
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,258
it will be dealt with henceforth
as a forbidden Jutsu.

230
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,051
– What?!
– Huh?!

231
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,013
W-What do you mean?

232
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:40,393
This Jutsu poses a great burden
on the cells of the muscles,

233
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,520
it's a kind of "Self-sacrificing Technique."

234
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:47,734
Humans normally utilize,
at most, 20 percent...

235
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,278
of the "power" that the muscles have.

236
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,822
Do you understand?
Only 20 percent!

237
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,742
And if nearly 100 percent
of the "power" is used

238
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,994
the muscles themselves will disintegrate.

239
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,665
So, the brain usually controls the "power."

240
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:08,713
However, this Jutsu forces the
brain's limiter to go off by using Chakra,

241
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,425
allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...

242
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,137
In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu
which relies on a secret technique

243
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,849
that brings forth "power" almost
to the limit of one's body.

244
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,437
So the only time it is all right
to use this Jutsu

245
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,481
is when a certain condition is met...

246
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,984
So...when is that?

247
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,946
Are you ready?

248
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,823
Take this to heart...

249
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,951
The condition is...

250
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,831
The condition is...

251
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,212
Guy Sensei...

252
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,549
I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.

253
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,802
Because this is the time you said..

254
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,100
"When protecting a precious person!"

255
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,228
He disappeared?!

256
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,609
It's just the beginning.

257
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,493
Oh, oh no!

258
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,996
There's no way he can break his fall!

259
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,290
Take this!

260
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,041
Primary Lotus!

261
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,509
This feeling...

262
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,179
Well well...

263
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,851
Just in time.

264
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,194
T-That's impossible!

265
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,448
That is a frightening Jutsu...

266
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,076
It did this much even though
I fell on the spongy dirt.

267
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,917
It's now my turn.

268
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,295
Oh no! With what I just did...

269
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,338
my body still isn't...

270
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,510
Lee!

271
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,436
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.

272
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,776
But our Jutsu exceeds that
and is the speed of sound!

273
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,451
I'll show you there are walls

274
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,120
which effort alone can
never break through.

275
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,019
Hey, can you hear it?

276
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:16,985
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

277
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:26,244
The ocean spans limitlessly

278
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:35,253
Please keep that smile on your face forever

279
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:43,011
Or else I'll cry

280
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,848
You won't have to search around you

281
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,935
It's all ok now.

282
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:55,982
Everyone is inside

283
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,736
this hand

284
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,866
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

285
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,454
When you forget what happiness is

286
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,416
Just sing.

287
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:18,629
Light is born, and darkness was born

288
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,882
The two are one

289
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:27,263
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

290
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:32,852
Hey, can you hear it?

291
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,901
I'm so frustrated!
I'm just pulling feet again.

292
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:44,697
I'm always just being protected.
I always just watch them from behind.

293
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,159
This time, I need to protect everyone!

294
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,620
Naruto, Sakuke, Lee!

295
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,082
I want to be like you too!

296
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,294
Next episode:
"Sakura Blossoms!"

297
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,214
Please watch my battle...

298
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,926
<=sign>
