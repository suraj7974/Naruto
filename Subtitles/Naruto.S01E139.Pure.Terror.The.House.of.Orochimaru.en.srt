1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,674
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,427
It's unforgivable!

22
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,517
Those guys...
the Fuma Ninja...

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,354
Their feelings towards the clan
are the same as our feelings!

24
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:48,818
Manipulating the Fuma's feelings of
wanting to restore their clan...

25
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:55,491
I'll kick Orochimaru's butt,
no matter what!

26
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:01,664
Pure Terror
The House of Orochimaru

27
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,421
How did the Pervy Sage,

28
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,133
who was once so easily defeated by
Old Lady Tsunade's numbing medicine

29
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,428
detect Sasame's medicine this time?

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,349
Isn't it strange that
Master Jiraiya's that sharp?

31
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,017
Hey, hey...

32
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:26,355
Remember when Sasame talked
about Hanzaki and said he's a traitor?

33
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,023
That's how I knew...

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,736
Hanzaki told me everything...

35
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:39,201
When Orochimaru came to this land,
there were those among us

36
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:43,414
who wanted to use his strength
to revive the clan

37
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:48,669
and those that saw his evil intent
and said we should not join him.

38
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:53,883
Hmm... so that's why you guys
were chased out of your village.

39
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:59,430
Yes. It was probably Orochimaru's idea

40
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,974
we were chased out of our village

41
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,853
as traitors who were getting
in the way of a revival of the clan.

42
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,108
When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,

43
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,363
I knew that Sasame had ties to a group
that was on Orochimaru's side.

44
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,748
Fool!

45
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,874
Hey, Pervy Sage!

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,418
Just wait a minute!

47
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,045
I'm prepared!

48
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:38,093
Sasame, you did it so that
you could meet Arashi... Isn't that so?

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,267
I'm sorry...
that was the only thing I could do.

50
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,269
Master Jiraiya!

51
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:50,856
Sasame did it only because
she wanted to see her cousin.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,775
Please forgive her!

53
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,319
I'm asking you to forgive her too!

54
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,489
The law of the Shinobi
is a strict thing...

55
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,703
I can't just acquit her like this.

56
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,335
Then punish me first!

57
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:19,009
I promised I'd help Sasame
see her cousin Arashi!

58
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:23,222
If I don't fulfill that I'll have twisted
my Way of Ninja!

59
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,641
Master Jiraiya, me too!

60
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,770
Now now, wait a minute!
It's not as if I'm gonna eat her alive.

61
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,522
– Huh?!
– Oh?

62
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,901
Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that

63
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,196
you might leave your village to
look for Arashi...

64
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,546
After you escort us to
Orochimaru's hideout,

65
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,965
you'll immediately head to
the inn where Hanzaki is

66
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,634
and wait there for our return.

67
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,846
That is the punishment given to you.

68
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,140
Master Jiraiya...

69
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,475
Pervy Sage,
I've gotta give you more credit!

70
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,060
Thank you, Master Jiraiya!

71
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:17,026
Well, Hanzaki treated me to
a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar

72
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,029
and asked me to look after Sasame...

73
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,741
I thought it was something
like that anyway!

74
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,868
I feel cheated that
I gave you more credit!

75
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,538
He, hey...
It's all right once in a while, right?

76
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,708
There's something called
socializing for adults...

77
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,640
There it is...

78
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,226
Leave the rest to us.

79
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,563
Sasame, be careful going back
to the inn.

80
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,652
Don't worry! I will absolutely
bring Arashi back!

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,825
Please take care of Arashi!

82
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,786
Leave it to me!

83
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,039
Just wait, and rest assured that
I'll do everything I can!

84
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,793
Stop getting so carried away Naruto,
you idiot!

85
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,169
Oww!

86
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,887
That's where...

87
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,682
Sasuke is...!

88
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,064
So this is the only entrance...

89
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,109
If they're lying in wait,
we'll be picked off.

90
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,070
But there's nothing we can do but go!

91
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,072
Well, don't panic.

92
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,867
If three large rats go, we'll stand out.

93
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,829
First, let's send out one
that won't stand out.

94
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,791
Summoning Jutsu!

95
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,881
Hey!

96
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,093
Th-The frog spoke!

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,597
Hey, it's been a while!
Sakura, this is Gamakichi.

98
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,392
Gamakichi?!

99
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,311
I wanted to ask you to do
some reconnaissance.

100
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:21,275
All right! That's a simple task.
Leave it to me!

101
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,030
I can't help it,
frogs give me the creeps ...

102
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,956
There doesn't seem
to be anything fishy...

103
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,918
There doesn't seem to be
a trap at the entrance.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,676
Arashi...

105
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,522
There's nothing to it around here.

106
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,746
Hmm...

107
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,414
What shall we do?

108
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,751
It seems there's no choice
but to split up into three.

109
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,962
My instinct tells me
it's the middle one!

110
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,506
Wait!
What the heck?!

111
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,052
At times like this, it's especially
important to move carefully...

112
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,898
All right, I'll go this way!

113
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,150
That's it?!

114
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,528
So what's so different from
my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?

115
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,240
Well, it's a question of feeling...

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,827
If you haven't found anything
after 30 minutes, come back.

117
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,121
Got it?
Yeah...

118
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:03,418
Naruto, Sakura, the two of you
should proceed together.

119
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,590
Listen, from this point forward,
it's the first avenue of hell.

120
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,009
A demon might appear,
or a snake might appear.

121
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,594
Take them on mindfully!

122
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,096
Yup!

123
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,766
I understand!

124
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,062
We're going down the middle!

125
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,107
Then I'm going this way...

126
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,316
See ya ...

127
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,665
Hmm...the smell of face powder.

128
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,007
I'm being invited in...

129
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,385
In that case, it might be good fun
to accept the invitation.

130
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,444
What...?

131
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,951
Because guests would be
arriving from far away,

132
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,831
I was directed by Lord Orochimaru
to entertain.

133
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,752
I'm guessing
it's a type of fox raccoon ghost...

134
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,797
If you're saying
I'm some raccoon or fox,

135
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:36,261
you ought to come over here
and check to see if I have a tail or not.

136
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,974
Oh, this path was right on...

137
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,061
How about yours, Naruto?

138
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,358
Sakura, be careful!

139
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,486
There's no telling what sort
of traps there might be...

140
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,112
Yeah...

141
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,573
– Oh?!
– Naruto?!

142
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,202
And you were the one who
said to be careful!

143
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,537
It was an ingenious trap floor!

144
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,670
Oh!
What the hell is next!

145
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,383
Sakura!

146
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,096
Naruto!

147
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,728
It's my fault...

148
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,147
Naruto!

149
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,274
What the hell...

150
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,239
I can't get out...

151
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,157
What're you doing?!

152
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,952
You screamed in such
a misleading way, I totally thought...

153
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,746
Give me a hand!

154
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,915
You're really a handful!

155
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,460
Ya saved me...

156
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,838
Really! I'll go first!

157
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,601
Naruto...

158
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,689
It's all right now.

159
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,065
Here!

160
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,862
Huh?!

161
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,125
Naruto!

162
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,715
Naruto!

163
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,177
Naruto!

164
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,263
Sakura...

165
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,349
Naruto?! Are you all right?

166
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,270
Don't worry about me.

167
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,023
You need to hurry and
get out of this trap hallway!

168
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,524
But...

169
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,904
I said go! I'll follow behind for sure!

170
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,864
Really?

171
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,284
Yeah... I'll catch up in no time!

172
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,333
You'd better come, no matter what.

173
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,460
It's a promise, you know...

174
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,179
The sake doesn't seem
tampered with.

175
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,641
So what kind of plot has been prepared...?

176
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,397
Just as I'd expect from
the Village Hidden in Sound...

177
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,984
Are you planning to put a Jutsu
on me using music?

178
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:43,240
The music isn't only for guests.
It's for myself...

179
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,784
I see...

180
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,079
What do you play for your heart?

181
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,169
Music for my own funeral...

182
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,557
Trying to seduce me...
You've underestimated this Jiraiya!

183
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:38,962
Escorting the guest to
the underworld is my last mission.

184
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,882
A suspended ceiling?!

185
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,682
I need to hurry up
and get out of this place!

186
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,809
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

187
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,147
This is torture!

188
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,065
What the hell?!

189
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,192
Give me a hand!

190
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,321
We need to build up our Chakra
and create the Rasengan!

191
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,281
Don't be absurd!

192
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,117
We can't stretch
our bodies beyond this!

193
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,870
My muscles are cramping up!

194
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,873
Man! I've gotta do something...

195
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,833
– What!
– Huh?!

196
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,418
What?!

197
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,003
– Water?!
– Water!

198
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,976
Looks like I've been saved.

199
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
Hey, get outta my way!

200
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,399
Oh, it's you, Naruto.

201
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,736
Gamakichi, is there
a way out somewhere?

202
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,658
Don't know!
I was flushed down here too.

203
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,412
So it's no good...

204
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,665
Hey, are you all right?

205
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,667
How could I be all right!

206
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,817
Naruto's taking a long time.

207
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,860
Maybe I should go back...

208
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,822
It's admirable that
you made it this far, Sakura.

209
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,033
Is that Kabuto's voice?!

210
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,494
Isn't it ironic?

211
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:21,040
During the Chunin Exam
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves,

212
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,043
you were the only one
that dragged the team down,

213
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,171
but yet you're the one
to make it this far.

214
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,089
I'm not by myself!

215
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,176
Naruto and Master Jiraiya
will be here right away!

216
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,638
Where's Sasuke?
He is all right, isn't he?

217
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:40,477
Shouldn't you be worried about
Naruto and Master Jiraiya,

218
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,604
and not Sasuke?

219
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:51,070
Well, it may very well be that those two
are no longer in this world anymore.

220
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,530
No way...

221
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:59,078
There's no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto
would be taken down that easily!

222
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,080
I wonder if that's so?

223
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:06,169
Maybe you dragged Naruto
down like you always do?

224
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,839
So I'm right ...

225
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,425
Naruto...

226
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,142
If you're worried
you should go and see...

227
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,814
Or perhaps you're afraid
of me attacking

228
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,358
and you can't come out
from behind the pillar.

229
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,321
If someone like you were
on my team,

230
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,324
I don't know how many lives
I would need.

231
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,408
I can too...

232
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,118
I can too!

233
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,213
Substitution Jutsu?!

234
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,384
Substitution again?!

235
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,932
I can too...
When I fight, I fight!

236
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,352
As I thought, this is all you've got...

237
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,857
It's about time I put an end to this.

238
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,903
I can't keep Lord Orochimaru waiting
for no reason any longer, you see.

239
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,947
Orochimaru?!

240
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,458
Now...shall we see...

241
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,130
just who will be stealing
scrolls from whom?

242
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,426
We'll fight to the death!

243
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,250
No! I'm different from how I was...then!

244
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,712
I wonder if that's true...

245
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,518
It can't be...

246
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,690
Even if you put up a bluff,
I can foresee ...

247
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,362
You are already...finished.

248
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,525
When I recalled the parts one by one,

249
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:21,864
I felt as though
I had understood everything

250
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,536
Faded words

251
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:32,709
which I kept so close to me

252
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:38,256
Speechless nights,

253
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,260
a hint of warmth,

254
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:49,308
and this distant yearning for you

255
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,186
I live,

256
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,401
simply repeating this cycle

257
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:04,323
Held in my two hands

258
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:09,996
A droplet of time

259
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:17,879
Softly clutching forgotten memories

260
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,715
Lost words

261
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,227
I'll keep these thoughts...

262
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,234
I'm scared.
What is this intimidating feeling?

263
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,696
My legs are weak and
I don't have any strength in my body.

264
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:47,408
I thought I'm not the same person
as I was in the past.

265
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,036
I must stop. Calm down.

266
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,039
These guys are here,
which means Sasuke is definitely here!

267
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,418
I need to fight!
I came here to save Sasuke!

268
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,380
Next time, "Two Heartbeats:
Kabuto's Trap"
