1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,511
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,146
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,995
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,498
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,258
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,218
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,891
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,987
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,866
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,119
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,250
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,087
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,386
Inari! Give me a hand.

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,055
I'll be right there.

22
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,447
This mist...

23
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,200
Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!

24
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,250
I knew he was still alive.

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,043
Making an appearance so soon, eh...

26
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,045
Say, Kakashi Sensei.

27
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,006
This is his...Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!

28
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,057
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.

29
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,602
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.

30
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,524
He's still trembling. Poor thing.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,536
I'm trembling with...excitement.

32
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,498
Do it, Sasuke.

33
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,595
I can see him!

34
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,849
Well, well. So you discerned
the Water Doppelganger Jutsu.

35
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,476
That brat's grown quite a bit.

36
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,314
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

37
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,940
So it seems.

38
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,332
Damn it!

39
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,588
I'm totally late!

40
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:53,150
Well, well... It seems my prediction
was right on the money.

41
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,443
Prediction?

42
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,861
That little mask...

43
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,404
Oh!

44
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,073
I knew it... Heh!

45
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,242
So the Elite Shinobi of
the Hidden Mist thing

46
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,245
was a bald-faced lie!

47
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,415
No matter how you look at him,
he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.

48
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,334
Standing together with him and all...

49
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,797
How dare he show up like that
after what he did!

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,967
I hate brats who think they're so cool...

51
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,677
He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,345
Oh...really?

53
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,181
I'll do it.

54
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,349
Huh?

55
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,729
With his bad acting...
I hate brats who think they're so cool!

56
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,898
Sasuke, you are so cool!

57
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:38,153
That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke...

58
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,573
He's an impressive youth.

59
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,783
Hmm...

60
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,535
Even though those Water Clones

61
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,580
have only 1/10th the strength
of their original...

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,833
To think he went that well.

63
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,253
However, you made
the preemptive move.

64
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,921
Go!

65
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,673
Right!

66
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,177
What?!

67
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:17,026
Haku's Secret Jutsu:
Crystal Ice Mirrors

68
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,914
Are you Tazuna's daughter?

69
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,917
Sorry, but you're coming with us.

70
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,766
Mom!

71
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,977
Don't come out!
Get out of here, quick!

72
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,021
What's with you, brat?!

73
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,400
Shall we take him, too?

74
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,819
One hostage is fine.

75
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,280
Hostage...?!

76
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,449
Then...

77
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,744
Shall we kill him?

78
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,374
Wait!

79
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,216
If you lay a hand on that child...

80
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,926
I'll bite off my tongue
and kill myself!

81
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,475
You want a hostage, right?

82
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,070
Thank your mom, kid.

83
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,204
Oh, man...
It's not enough...

84
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,291
Knock it off.
You just tried out your sword earlier.

85
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,794
Forget it already and
let's take the woman.

86
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,846
Mom, I'm sorry...

87
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,056
I'm so sorry!

88
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,771
I'm weak, so I can't protect you...

89
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,741
I don't want to die...
I'm scared!

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,203
You crybaby...

91
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,834
So you're just gonna cry all day
like the lead in a tragedy?

92
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:43,422
An idiot like you can just
cry forever! You crybaby!

93
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,843
He's probably tired of crying.

94
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,848
So, he knows the true meaning of
the word strong.

95
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,393
Like your father.

96
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,234
For the things I truly hold
dear to myself...

97
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:08,739
I protect them until the end
with both these arms,

98
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,282
even if it looks like I might lose my life!

99
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,747
Inari...

100
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,050
Can I...

101
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,262
can I also become strong...?

102
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,936
Dad!

103
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,444
Looking at that beautiful skin
of yours makes me want to cut you.

104
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,488
Hey...walk faster.

105
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,906
Wait!

106
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,661
Inari!

107
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,872
What? It's just the kid from before.

108
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:04,294
Get...get away from my mom!

109
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,215
Man...This brat's hopeless.

110
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,050
Let's do it!

111
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,763
If you do that, I'll bite off
my tongue and...

112
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,725
Shut up. Go to sleep.

113
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,477
I...na...ri.

114
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,325
Well, well...
He can see that speed, eh...

115
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,287
Yes...

116
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,915
Sakura, surround Tazuna and
don't move away from me.

117
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,917
Let Sasuke handle him!

118
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,002
Okay.

119
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,679
I don't want to have to kill you...

120
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,640
I'd like for you to back down.

121
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,934
Nonsense...

122
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,686
I knew it...

123
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:08,859
But you won't be able to keep up
with my speed.

124
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,863
Also, I've already made
two preemptive moves.

125
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,448
Two preemptive moves?

126
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,701
The first one is the scattered water.

127
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,664
And the second one was
blocking one of your hands...

128
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:27,794
Therefore, you'll just be able
to defend my attack...

129
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,424
What?! With one hand he's...?!

130
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,262
A one-handed Sign?

131
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,431
I've never seen such a thing before...

132
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,103
A Thousand Needles of Death!

133
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,778
So he doesn't want to kill him...eh.

134
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,530
I wonder if that's how he really feels...

135
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,449
Sasuke!

136
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,706
Remember...that training...

137
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,883
Build up Chakra at one burst...

138
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,319
The Substitution Jutsu...?!

139
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,946
The woman... Hmm?

140
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,323
Sorry I was late.

141
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,956
Heroes usually appear
on the scene late, so...

142
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,291
Naruto...!

143
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,588
Inari, you did well!

144
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,714
Huh?

145
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:59,886
Thanks to you distracting them,
I was able to save your mom.

146
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,938
Naruto...how did you know that
those samurai were here?

147
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,068
In the forest, there was a boar that
had been cut-up with a sword.

148
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:19,990
Other than that,
there were trees with lots of cuts.

149
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,868
They headed in
the direction of your house...

150
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,536
so I got worried.

151
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,664
I see.

152
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,915
Well...

153
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,461
If it isn't the no-good Ninja
that Tazuna hired...

154
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,545
Let's do it...

155
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,921
Yeah...

156
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,381
Here they come!

157
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,014
Hah! Something like that won't work!

158
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,226
Fools.

159
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,729
Prepare yourself!

160
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,829
W-Wow...!

161
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,875
It's done!

162
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,631
Naruto, you're just like...a Ninja!

163
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,843
You fool.
I was a Ninja to start with!

164
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,939
Build up Chakra at one burst...

165
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,275
to the feet!

166
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,244
He vanished...

167
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,463
You're surprisingly stupid...

168
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,843
From here on...
you'll only defend my attack!

169
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,946
To think Haku would
lose in speed...

170
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:29,077
It seems that I'm faster than you...

171
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:35,333
I can't have you mocking our team,
calling them brats...

172
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,544
He may not look it,

173
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,131
but Sasuke is the number one rookie
of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

174
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,218
And Sakura is our sharpest...

175
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,348
Hah! Serves you right!

176
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,478
And the other one is
the number one hyperactive,

177
00:14:55,562 --> 00:15:00,150
knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.

178
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,322
You have a cold?

179
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,532
I'm okay.

180
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:12,329
Anyway...
Sorry about yesterday, Inari.

181
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,580
Huh?

182
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:21,087
Branding you a crybaby...
Forget I ever said that.

183
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,092
You're strong!

184
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,935
Dang it!

185
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,272
I...decided never
to cry again, but...

186
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,696
Now you'll laugh at me again

187
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,200
and call me a crybaby.

188
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,370
What're you saying...?!

189
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,917
It's okay...when you're happy.

190
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,885
It's okay to cry when you're happy!

191
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,097
Naruto...

192
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,694
Now then.
I can leave the rest to you, right?

193
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,903
Yeah...

194
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,490
Okay, I'm going to hop over
to the bridge for a bit.

195
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,123
Man, it's tough being a hero!
That's for sure!

196
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,553
Haku, do you know what this means?

197
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,763
At this rate, you'll be defeated
by your intended victim...

198
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,682
Yes...

199
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,645
What...?

200
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,735
It's unfortunate...

201
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,613
Is this...cold air...?

202
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,669
Hidden Jutsu!

203
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,355
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

204
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,200
What is it? What's that Jutsu?

205
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,056
Are these...mirrors?!

206
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,808
What...

207
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,518
in the world...?!

208
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,230
Damn it!

209
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,570
I'm your opponent, aren't I?

210
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:37,867
Since that Jutsu has appeared...
he's done for.

211
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,499
Now then...I'll start.

212
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,963
I shall show you...
my true speed!

213
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,676
Sasuke!

214
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,684
Sasuke!

215
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,708
If you make a move,
I'll kill those two!!

216
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,719
I'm sorry, Tazuna!

217
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,097
I'm stepping away from here for a bit.

218
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,101
Sure. Go!

219
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,314
Sakura!

220
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,357
Sasuke!

221
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,361
Take this!

222
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,298
He caught it?!

223
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,814
What?!

224
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,658
Who is it?!

225
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,790
It's that idiot...that showoff...

226
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:55,254
The number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja...

227
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,106
Naruto Uzumaki...

228
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,150
is finally here!

229
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,582
Naruto Uzumaki is finally here!

230
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,833
It'll be okay.

231
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,710
Now that the hero of the story
has appeared,

232
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,255
I'll smash those stupid
funny-looking mirrors in no time...

233
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,175
Huh? Why won't mirrors
made of ice break?

234
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,344
Why won't they melt?

235
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,306
What the heck is going on here?!

236
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:14,102
Next episode: "The Number One Hyperactive
Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!"

237
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,729
As for me, will I be able
to kick butt once again?
