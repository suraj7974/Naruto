1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and
gather the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long
way to go on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards
the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,361
There was something beyond
that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,679
Too Late for Help

16
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:41,393
You guys did good
work. Komei has confessed.

17
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,856
It seems he plotted the Cursed Warrior...

18
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,860
to mislead the public and
to take the feudal lord position.

19
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,404
Is that what Komei said?

20
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,157
Yes. It turned out to be such a trifle.

21
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,618
The Cursed Warrior vanishing

22
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,954
was a soldier
disguising himself as the Warrior

23
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:05,501
using a strong nitrohydrochloric
acid to melt his own flesh.

24
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,763
It's empty again.

25
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,060
With this, the Cursed Warrior
incident is resolved.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,812
Now the Land of Birds should return

27
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,815
to the beautiful and
quiet land it used to be.

28
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,567
Just a minute!

29
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,485
But the Cursed Warrior still isn't...!

30
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,695
Don't bother.

31
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,779
But...!

32
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,490
Now you are relieved of your duty.

33
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,577
Have a safe journey back to your village...

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,836
Why?!

35
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,047
You said the one we saw first

36
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,633
and the one last
night were different, right?

37
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,845
Perhaps there were multiple
people disguised as the Cursed Warrior,

38
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,889
not just one alone.

39
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,349
If there was a person inside disguised,

40
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,894
then how do
you explain the Warrior flying?!

41
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,187
As long as our mission
has been ordered complete,

42
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,149
there's no reason to
continue the mission in this land now.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,528
Besides, Komei
confessed to the crime, right?

44
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,614
But, it's suspicious!

45
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,909
I can't go along with it if
I don't get the whole story!

46
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,411
This land has its own circumstances.

47
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,205
Getting too involved will cause trouble.

48
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,084
Then I'll just have to do it my way.

49
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,294
Hold it.

50
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,963
I'm the leader of this team.

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,842
So what?!

52
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,970
You look into the movements
of the Cursed Warrior once more.

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,849
Tenten and I will reinvestigate
this incident from a different angle.

54
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,685
What? But the mission's over...

55
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,521
You have a point with what you said.

56
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,025
Everything is moving along too swimmingly.

57
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,777
All right! Leave it to me.

58
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,907
Huh? Where are you going, Naruto?

59
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,535
Isn't it obvious? To
investigate the Cursed Warrior!

60
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,083
Oh, Chishima.

61
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,543
Um, Naruto just now...

62
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,880
It's nothing, it's nothing.

63
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,048
Did you have business with us?

64
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,967
Oh, yes.

65
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,013
You have all been so
helpful to me the whole time...

66
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,434
I feel so bad about that low payment...

67
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,020
Additional money?

68
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,438
We couldn't...

69
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,358
No, it's the specialty
of the Land of Birds,

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,943
chicken wing buns filled with bean jam.

71
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,704
Yakitori Tsurucho

72
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,923
Thanks!

73
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,701
Sure enough,
this area's fishy, believe it.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,079
It's kind of
time-consuming searching alone...

75
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,043
Summoning Jutsu!

76
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:42,259
Ahh, long time no see.
Are you giving me a snack?

77
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,012
Why is it you guys?!

78
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,222
Dad's busy with stuff, so.

79
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:51,602
No, I can't have
Boss Gama appearing, either...

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,396
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,358
You guys have a better
sense of smell than humans, right?

82
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,860
You're calling us puppies?!

83
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,906
Geez! Toad authority
has sure hit rock bottom!

84
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,949
Gamatatsu, we're leaving!

85
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,870
Gamatatsu?

86
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,414
Hey, Gamatatsu!

87
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,961
A frog that pounces on a willow leaf?

88
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,546
What're you doing, you idiot?!

89
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,965
Big Brother Gamakichi...

90
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,219
I wonder what...this is?

91
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,725
Whoa, it's dark. It's night.

92
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,229
Good night.

93
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,193
Good morning.

94
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,153
What's this?

95
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,405
It's a kite painted black.

96
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,698
A kite?

97
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,950
Look up there!

98
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,538
That's a totally huge kite, believe it.

99
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,792
I wonder if there was a big
kite-flying festival or something.

100
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,088
It's rather plain for a festival kite...

101
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,257
What?! What does that mean?

102
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,967
Oh no!

103
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,260
Hey! Where are you going?!

104
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,682
I'm back.

105
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,029
I get it... If one were to fly
that in the cover of a dark night...

106
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,323
A Cursed Warrior
hanging onto the black kite

107
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,033
would look like he was flying...

108
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,288
With this, the mystery of
the flying warrior is solved, believe it!

109
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,291
Next...

110
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,464
Someone was here on that night...

111
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,598
What is it?

112
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,477
The Cursed Warrior came out from here.

113
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,694
It just looks like an old
temple that isn't used much at all.

114
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,988
You're right.

115
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,489
Let's go, Gamatatsu!

116
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:15,829
But Big Brother Gamakichi,
it's nice and cool here.

117
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,708
What're you talking about?!
In such a hot and humid temple...

118
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,507
Indeed, that's a nice damp wind.

119
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,511
See? Isn't it comfortable?

120
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,972
Draft from down below here...?

121
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,026
What's this?

122
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:51,823
Wow! I wonder if a giant worm made this.

123
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,868
Or a mole?

124
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,453
All right, let's check it out.

125
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:02,042
I wonder how we should
greet a mole if we were to meet one.

126
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,127
Like I care!

127
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,677
So Naruto is still
investigating the Cursed Warrior, huh?

128
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,139
I should probably inform Lord Moso.

129
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,479
There was some trouble caused,

130
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,816
but we have at last found a safe refuge.

131
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,256
After him!

132
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,725
Big Brother, where are we?

133
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,935
Huh?! This place is...

134
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,689
This is the residence
of the feudal lord, isn't it?

135
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,776
Really? Residence of the feudal lord?

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,154
No wonder it's an impressive building.

137
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,073
It was connected to this place?

138
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,079
What was that sound?

139
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,425
Oh! What a nice view.
Hey! What're you doing?!

140
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,928
Shh! Keep quiet! We'll be discovered.

141
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,974
Big Brother Gamakichi!

142
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,476
Uh, oh!

143
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,810
You blockhead!

144
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:52,903
Uh, umm... Good work with your duties!

145
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,155
As for me, I'm not anyone suspicious!

146
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,077
I was asked by the Superintendent Moso and

147
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,789
I'm investigating the incident...

148
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,709
It'll make sense if I tell you about it!

149
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,215
Lord Sagi! We have
captured a suspicious man.

150
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,258
What shall we do with him?

151
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,262
What...? Oh!

152
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,766
Oh. Sagi, bro!
Hey! We met at the lake, didn't we?

153
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,103
Explain to them about me!

154
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,106
I know no such person.

155
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,524
What?!

156
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,443
He's not worth sending
to the magistrate's office.

157
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,737
Lock him in the dungeon.

158
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,822
Yes, my lord!

159
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,368
Hey, that's harsh! Come on, Sagi!

160
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:46,540
Hey! Wait a minute! Come on, hey!

161
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,601
Come on. This is a misunderstanding!

162
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,936
I was just going after the Cursed Warrior!

163
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,274
Umm, everything will make
sense if you just ask Mr. Moso.

164
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,234
You okay?

165
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,196
Yo!

166
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,116
I can't be fighting
the soldiers of my employer's land.

167
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:08,455
Geez. You had to go
and get caught in that trap!

168
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,044
Well, it's cool. I can get
out of a place like this right away

169
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,879
if I just use both my hands.

170
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,381
Hey, untie this.

171
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,217
Right. Just a second.

172
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,750
Th-The Cursed Warrior...?!

173
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,796
Damn it!

174
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,048
If I could just use both
hands, this guy would be...!

175
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,135
Big Brother, are
we going to let things be?

176
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,971
If things go wrong, we'd be sliced in two.

177
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,515
I wouldn't want that.

178
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,785
Just a little more...

179
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,267
Just a little more...!

180
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,106
Sagi?!

181
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,985
What's going on here?

182
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,488
You're the other Cursed Warrior?

183
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,782
But, why?

184
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,455
They say people become
disembodied spirits and avenge themselves...

185
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,251
But that's a lie!

186
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,797
This watch has been handed
down from generation to generation

187
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,132
in the feudal lord family.

188
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,220
It was supposed to be
passed from father to son...

189
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:01,187
But now along with that death,
the watch has stopped ticking away.

190
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,192
It must have been very sad...

191
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,079
I am shamelessly living
on only for the sake of revenge!

192
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,958
I can go to hell if I can
just complete my revenge!

193
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,252
That's no good!

194
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,588
There is no way you could understand

195
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,214
how someone who has had
everything taken away from them feels!

196
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,216
Like I know about stuff like that!

197
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:38,349
But I, at least, know that living
for the sake of revenge is wrong!

198
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,607
You're a feudal lord, aren't you?

199
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,859
Is revenge the job of a feudal lord?

200
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,110
You know that's not it.

201
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,616
The true culprit Komei has been arrested.

202
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:59,454
You should just leave
the rest to Moso. Okay?

203
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,087
It is no concern of yours...

204
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,174
I must not let you live

205
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,386
now that you have learned everything!

206
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,557
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord...

207
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,143
your fate is a death sentence!

208
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,979
No way...!

209
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,609
This is creepy...

210
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,029
This is the tomb of the successive
generations of feudal lords, right?

211
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
Yeah.

212
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,033
That's the tomb of the Lord Owashi...

213
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,579
Byakugan!

214
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,008
What's this?

215
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,888
What is it, Neji? What are you seeing?!

216
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,144
There's something
poisonous in Owashi's body.

217
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,983
Was he assassinated...?!

218
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,665
We're surrounded.

219
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,508
An announcement to
the Ninja from the Leaf Village.

220
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,637
A message has just now been delivered
from the residence of the feudal lord!

221
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,599
Your comrade has
been arrested for infiltrating...

222
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,267
the residence of the feudal lord...

223
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,936
and his death
sentence has been determined!

224
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,274
Leave the Land of Birds at once!

225
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:56,821
If you don't, you will be
executed here for the same crime.

226
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,576
It doesn't matter! Draw your bows!

227
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,006
Neji, what should we do?

228
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,591
Let's go to
the residence of the feudal lord.

229
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,967
We're going to save Naruto!

230
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,188
You're...

231
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,733
Kakashi Sensei! Naruto's in trouble!

232
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,693
We have to go to the residence
of the feudal lord immediately

233
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,028
and save him...

234
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,404
We can't do that.

235
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,534
Your mission is over.
But!

236
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,871
Don't do anything other than the mission.

237
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:22,740
So many things happen

238
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:28,538
on this endless road, huh?

239
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:34,168
Although you're strong-willed,

240
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

241
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,387
What dreams

242
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,852
did you chase to get here?

243
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:57,483
Even I have times when

244
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

245
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:09,412
When you're sad,

246
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:14,834
I'll be close to you

247
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:21,007
Even on nights when
we're apart,

248
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

249
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,851
I'll be close to you

250
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,068
Are we really going
back to the village like this?

251
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,821
I told you. Our mission in
the Land of Birds is finished now.

252
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,157
But then, what'll happen to Naruto?

253
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,367
We can't interfere with
this land's internal affairs.

254
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,702
No way...

255
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,206
Sorry. The responsibility
rests on me, the leader.

256
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,336
Let it go... Sacrifice is
a part of Shinobi missions.

257
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,297
Next time: "The Death of Naruto."
