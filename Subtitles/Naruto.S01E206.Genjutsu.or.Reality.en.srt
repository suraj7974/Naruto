1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,632
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,264
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,366
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,748
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,593
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,266
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:04,356
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I'm not by your side

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

10
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

11
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

12
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,547
Our two hearts

13
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,244
No way...

14
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,372
To think Old Man Hokage would
try to eliminate Yakumo.

15
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,582
No way could that ever happen!

16
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,126
But if by some remote chance,

17
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,088
Kurenai Sensei
accepted such a mission...

18
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,133
it would explain her strange behavior.

19
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,637
No, no way!
No way that could ever happen.

20
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,439
Are you okay, Kurenai Sensei...?

21
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,819
Yes. I feel quite a bit better now
thanks to your first-aid...

22
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,621
Who in the world is
Kurenai Sensei protecting?

23
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,375
It was the Third Hokage who
told her to take custody of Yakumo...

24
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,086
What in the world is her real mission...?

25
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,754
What's going on?!

26
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,684
Th-That's...

27
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,062
Th-The Village Hidden in the Leaves is...

28
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,480
No way...!

29
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:21,285
Genjutsu or Reality?

30
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,707
It's like the aftermath of
a large war that broke out.

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,917
Hinata!

32
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,460
Right...

33
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,628
Byakugan!

34
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,222
There's not a person in the village...

35
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,016
What is this...?

36
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,685
What's going on here?!

37
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,166
Kiba, Hinata...
Is there anything unusual in the area?

38
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,629
No enemy signs anywhere...

39
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,342
Akamaru doesn't sense
the scent of any outsiders, either.

40
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,680
What happened in the village
while we were away...?

41
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,350
First, let's take Yakumo and
Kurenai Sensei to the hospital.

42
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,894
We'll check out the village after that...

43
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,521
R-Right...!

44
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,493
Leaf Hospital

45
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,953
What's this...?

46
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,123
Anyway, let's get these two
to a hospital room...

47
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,886
I'm okay.
More importantly, take care of Yakumo.

48
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,096
Right...

49
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,515
You're out of danger now...

50
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,978
Oh, no...She's unconscious!

51
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,313
Her vital signs are weakening...

52
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,149
I wonder if there's any medicine left...

53
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,110
Naruto, help me look...

54
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,403
Oh, well, but...

55
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,654
Just hurry!

56
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,822
R-Right...

57
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,662
There's no scent of blood.

58
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,498
Everyone must have
evacuated somewhere.

59
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,208
Let's us check out the village.

60
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,293
Right...

61
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,920
Make sure you three
always act together...

62
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:41,258
Come back here in thirty minutes,
no matter what.

63
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,468
Right...

64
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,180
What is it?

65
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:51,143
Sure enough, you have to be the one
to give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!

66
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,869
What's been the matter with you?!

67
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,496
The pharmacy is that way.

68
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,957
Nothing. I was just concerned
about Kurenai Sensei...

69
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,709
So let's hurry and get the medicine!

70
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:21,715
I mean, Kurenai Sensei's going to...
eliminate...Yakumo...

71
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,425
Eliminate?

72
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,136
Th-Th-That couldn't be...

73
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,848
I was just kind of out of it.

74
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,933
Huh?

75
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,977
Huh...? What was that?!

76
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,646
What is it, Sakura?!

77
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,648
There's someone here other than us.

78
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,857
What?!

79
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,364
That's close!

80
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,118
I'll leave the two in
the hospital room to you, Sakura!

81
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,994
I'm going after him!

82
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,162
Got it!

83
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,462
Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

84
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,590
Huh?! My Jutsu won't activate?!

85
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,439
Wait! This isn't the time
to be fighting.

86
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,609
You guys are the ones who
attacked the mountain cottage, right?!

87
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,404
I am Unkai of the Kurama Clan...

88
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,365
Kurama?!
The same clan as Yakumo?!

89
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,535
Why would her clan attack her?!

90
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,709
Listen to me!
If you don't, everyone will die!

91
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,316
What's this smell of blood?!

92
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,359
Byakugan!

93
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,493
Close your Byakugan, Hinata!

94
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,038
Kiba, restrain Akamaru's
sense of smell!

95
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,332
–What?!
–What is it?!

96
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,211
It's because we're caught
in someone's Jutsu.

97
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,587
Say what?!

98
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,633
Yes. We're now inside
Yakumo's Genjutsu.

99
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,221
It may seem as if the Leaf Village
was in a war.

100
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,682
But this is merely
a part of her Genjutsu.

101
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:41,146
This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu
and we've all been trapped in it?

102
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,608
That's totally impossible!

103
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:50,781
But if her latent powers have awakened,
it wouldn't be hard at all.

104
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,991
This whole village?!

105
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,746
This ground we're standing on,
this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!

106
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,125
There are occasions when
superior senses become a hindrance.

107
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,630
It's because no matter how superior
the sense of sight or smell might be,

108
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,343
ultimately it's the human brain that
processes and perceives the information!

109
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,305
There are times when
well-developed brains make errors

110
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,517
in the process of interpreting
complex electric signals.

111
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,521
However, insects act only
with sharp senses.

112
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,650
Unlike the information processed
with a human brain,

113
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,986
insects narrow this information down
to the very minimum.

114
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,990
Look. My insects
are still under control.

115
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,450
They will not be deceived.

116
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,708
There are occasions when

117
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,418
Yakumo's Genjutsu
summons thunderclouds

118
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,961
and produces fire.

119
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,881
And that is planted directly into
the human brain

120
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,009
as if it had occurred in reality.

121
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:57,514
And that causes the brain
to hurt one's own body.

122
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,933
Then, Grandma's house...

123
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,399
That's also Yakumo's power?!

124
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,276
It's not just that...

125
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,530
She can even kill people easily
if she were so inclined.

126
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,244
But these tremors...

127
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,455
Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?

128
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,165
You'll see any moment now...

129
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,596
A-A snake!

130
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,222
It's too huge!

131
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,309
Is that also Genjutsu?!

132
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,979
It's a terrifying image that
our cerebrums have created.

133
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,565
Physical influence is absolutely...

134
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,069
unthinkable!

135
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,571
No way!

136
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,292
Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!

137
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,255
Huh?!

138
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,901
Really...? Yakumo can kill people
with Genjutsu..?

139
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:38,073
So is that why the Third Hokage
tried to eliminate her?

140
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,424
Yakumo, Yakumo?!

141
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:04,433
Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei...

142
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,853
Over here... Kurenai Sensei...

143
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,198
I still can't believe it.

144
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,034
To think Yakumo would do
something like that!

145
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,787
Once every several generations,

146
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:30,167
a child is born into our Kurama Clan
with physical idiosyncrasies.

147
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,127
That child is Yakumo...

148
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,798
Moreover, what's terrifying is her
using her powers unconsciously

149
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,343
without being able to control it.

150
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,640
It's getting kind of hot.

151
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:53,899
Don't!

152
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,240
What's happening
outside the door...?

153
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,825
Don't open it!

154
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:08,997
Wh-What's this...?

155
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,422
Why's there lava here...?

156
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,932
That's an illusion our brains have
created due to Yakumo's Genjutsu.

157
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,937
But even it's an illusion,
if we were to dive into the lava,

158
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,191
our brains would determine it to be lava
and our bodies would burn up.

159
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,777
That is Yakumo's power.

160
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,864
So is that why Old Man Hokage
and Kurenai Sensei

161
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,492
tried to eliminate Yakumo?

162
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,244
That's not it.

163
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,622
What they really
attempted to kill

164
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,167
was the monster
existing inside Yakumo.

165
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,169
A monster?

166
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,715
Before too long,
Yakumo's massive powers

167
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,927
created a terrifying monster.

168
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,138
If left alone, the monster that
continues to grow would

169
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,391
someday attempt to
become one with her

170
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,893
by absorbing
Yakumo's consciousness.

171
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,313
The Third Hokage and Kurenai
determined as such

172
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:20,610
and all there was to do in order
to save Yakumo was to seal her powers.

173
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,281
A monster in her body...

174
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,202
So that's what it was...

175
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,705
I can't just sit back like this!

176
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,251
Oh!

177
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,463
Oh. My entire fortune!

178
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:45,218
I told you. If you dive into the lava,
you're body will really burn up.

179
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,179
Then does that mean
we can't get out of here?!

180
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,807
No, there is one way.

181
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,642
What's that way?!

182
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:58,231
If you seal your five senses,
the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.

183
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,860
You must escape from this world
and attack Yakumo!

184
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,862
What?! Attack Yakumo?!

185
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,626
Ow-ow-ow!

186
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,803
What? This is...Satomi Hill?!

187
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,181
Old Man Unkai!

188
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,022
It seems you safely made it
out of Yakumo's Genjutsu...

189
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,149
What the heck happened...?!

190
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,944
At the point you brought Yakumo
out of the mountain cottage,

191
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,490
you were already
caught in her Genjutsu.

192
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,574
What?!

193
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,043
Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!

194
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,004
Kiba!

195
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,506
Shino!

196
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,509
Wh-Where are we...?

197
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,929
Sakura, examine
Old Man Unkai's wounds.

198
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,013
Unkai...?

199
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,727
What happened?!
These are awful burns!

200
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,065
We were able to get out of
Yakumo's Genjutsu

201
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,359
thanks to this old man!

202
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,238
Rather, I'd say
we were driven out...

203
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:33,827
Her only target was
Yuhi Kurenai, after all...

204
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,413
Where's Kurenai Sensei now?

205
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,540
Well, probably...

206
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,410
Yakumo...

207
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,834
Kurenai Sensei...
What do you think of my paintings...?

208
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,502
Aren't they wonderful?!

209
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,088
What did you do to everyone?

210
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,634
Don't worry...
I just drove out the intruders...

211
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,514
Eventually, I must have my revenge
on the Leaf Village...

212
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,350
But first, I have some business
with you, Sensei.

213
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,562
Why include the Leaf Village as well...?

214
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,399
I should be enough of a target
for your revenge...!

215
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,693
I won't let you say
you don't know!

216
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,671
How is it?
Awesome, huh?

217
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:14,260
I have complete control now of letting
you live or killing you, Sensei.

218
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,139
Tell me the truth...

219
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:23,978
It was the Third Hokage who ordered
my father and mother killed and

220
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,733
the Kurama Clan and me eliminated
from the Leaf Village, right?

221
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:29,943
No.

222
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,911
The Third Hokage did not order
such a mission...

223
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,913
Why do you lie?!

224
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,341
Please.

225
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,802
Tell me the truth!

226
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,056
You'll vanish if you don't,
Kurenai Sensei...

227
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,100
Such a sad child...

228
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:07,230
If killing me will eliminate your suffering,
then you should do it.

229
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:12,068
If your hate will vanish along
with your suffering!

230
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,657
Why do you cry?
I won't be deceived by tears like that!

231
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:25,248
1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!

232
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:32,130
Yeah, it feels good in
every kind of weather to sweat.

233
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:41,848
So the Kurama Clan are still here!
Might Guy will take you on!

234
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,726
W-Wait, Guy!

235
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,936
Huh?! G-Guy?

236
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,739
I see. So you guys were also
caught in the Kurama Genjutsu...

237
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,907
I'm sorry.

238
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,285
Well, you're alive and
that's all that matters.

239
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,369
Thank goodness,
thank goodness.

240
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,832
Oh, you guys are back!

241
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,084
Where are the village reinforcements?!

242
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,212
There's no time to explain!

243
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,297
What?!

244
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,342
Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!

245
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,636
What's up with them?!

246
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,974
Who's that man...?
And what about everyone?

247
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,685
Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.

248
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,062
But, well...

249
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,563
Just hurry!

250
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,648
R-Right...

251
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,110
Byakugan!

252
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,824
Those jerks...

253
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,369
No, Yakumo!

254
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,208
Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei
are in the innermost room.

255
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,417
All right!

256
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,753
Hey, wait!

257
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,762
Kiba!

258
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,144
The Key to the rusted heart's door

259
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:16,192
Will always be smiling right near by

260
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,536
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

261
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,124
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

262
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,753
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

263
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:40,633
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

264
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,555
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

265
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,767
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

266
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:54,313
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

267
00:21:54,397 --> 00:22:01,404
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

268
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,742
The wind is probably testing our hearts

269
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,788
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

270
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:15,209
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

271
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:19,964
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

272
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,719
The Key to the rusted heart's door

273
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:30,600
Will always be smiling right near by

274
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,567
Everyone, what's the current situation?

275
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,153
Naruto hasn't come back
since he first went in.

276
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,531
The insects had also detected
something strange and emerged.

277
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,325
Can you use your Byakugan
to look inside?

278
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,120
There's some kind of powerful force
that's getting in the way.

279
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,332
So all we can do is watch here?

280
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,294
Does this mean that all
we can do is believe in him and wait?

281
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,464
Next time:
"The Supposed Sealed Ability"
