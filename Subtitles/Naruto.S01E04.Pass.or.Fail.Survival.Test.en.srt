1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,979
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,356
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,736
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,531
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:35,870
For no single one,

7
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,540
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:45,004
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,218
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,220
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,807
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,768
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,479
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,070
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,286
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,709
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,338
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,011
He's late.

21
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,231
Naruto!
Stay still.

22
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:50,486
Why's it that only
our squad's teacher is late?

23
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,532
The other squads have gone off
somewhere with their new teachers,

24
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,826
and Iruka Sensei's also left.

25
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,911
Don't look at me.

26
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,623
Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!

27
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,586
Hey!

28
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,340
It'll be his fault because he's late.

29
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,848
Man! You're asking for it!

30
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,433
I like stuff like this!

31
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,397
A Jonin wouldn't get caught
in such a weak booby trap.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,109
That's right. You're such an idiot...!

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,535
I got him, I got him...

34
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,581
I-I'm sorry, sir.

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,376
I tried to stop him,
but Naruto did it on his own...

36
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,961
It's all good.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,840
Get real.
Is he really a Jonin?

38
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,639
How can I put this?

39
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,058
As for my first impression
of you guys...?

40
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,102
Well, I hate you.

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,526
Pass or Fail: Survival Test

42
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,448
Let's see.

43
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,200
First off, let me have
you guys introduce yourselves.

44
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,411
Introduce ourselves...

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,496
What should we say?

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,208
Your likes, dislikes,

47
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,963
your future dream,
hobbies, things like that!

48
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:39,261
Hey! Before that, please tell us
about yourself.

49
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:44,016
Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.

50
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,562
I don't feel like telling you
guys about my likes and dislikes.

51
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,609
I've never really thought
about my future dream...

52
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,280
As for my hobbies, I have many.

53
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,700
In the end,
isn't all we know his name?

54
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,785
Yeah.

55
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,870
Next is you guys.

56
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,206
Let's start with you.

57
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,209
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

58
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,211
I like instant ramen,

59
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,297
but what I like even more
is the ramen from Ichiraku

60
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,715
that Iruka Sensei treats me to.

61
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,217
What I dislike is the three minutes

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,552
after pouring hot water
in the instant ramen.

63
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,639
My hobby is eating and
comparing ramen!

64
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,557
And my future dream...

65
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,518
is to surpass the Hokage!

66
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,562
And so I'm going to get
the entire village

67
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,023
to acknowledge my existence!

68
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,151
I see...

69
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,279
this kid's grown up in
an interesting way.

70
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,991
Okay, next.

71
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,742
I'm Sakura Haruno.

72
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:48,539
What I like...I mean, who I like is...

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,460
And, my hobby is,
I mean...

74
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,672
My future dream is...

75
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,885
And?
What about your dislikes?

76
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,804
Naruto!

77
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,684
Girls at her age are probably
more interested in love

78
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,019
than the Ninja Arts.

79
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,353
And lastly.

80
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,690
My name's...Sasuke Uchiha.

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,737
I have lots of dislikes,
but no likes in particular.

82
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,405
Oh...

83
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,407
And...

84
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,035
I don't feel like summing up
my ambition as just a dream

85
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,494
but I do have an ambition!

86
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,999
The ambition to restore my clan
and without fail...

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,460
to kill a certain man!

88
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,635
He doesn't...

89
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,804
mean me, does he?

90
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,557
Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.

91
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,559
I knew it...

92
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,686
Good!

93
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,230
The three of you are very distinctive
and interesting!

94
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,275
We'll have a mission tomorrow!

95
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,236
Yes, sir! What kind of mission?

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,240
First, we'll do what we can do
with just four people.

97
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,701
What-what-what?!

98
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,163
A survival exercise.

99
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,665
Survival exercise?

100
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,958
Why are we doing an exercise

101
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,044
even though this is supposed
to be a mission?

102
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,798
We've had more than our share
of exercises in the Academy!

103
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,591
This is no simple exercise.

104
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,470
Then...then what kind of exercise is it?

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,148
Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?

106
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:43,112
Uh, well, if I tell you,
I know you'll grow disenchanted.

107
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,655
What?

108
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,908
Of the twenty-seven graduates,

109
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,578
only nine will be recognized
as junior ninjas.

110
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,999
The remaining eighteen will
be sent back to the Academy.

111
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,795
In other words, this exercise
is an extremely difficult test

112
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,714
with a failure rate of 66% or higher!

113
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,051
See, see?

114
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,636
You got disenchanted!

115
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,388
That's crazy!

116
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,973
To have suffered that much!

117
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,643
T-Then, what was
the graduation test for?

118
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,311
Oh, that.

119
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,565
It was just to select those who have
the potential of becoming Genin.

120
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,067
Whaaaat?!

121
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,902
Well, that's the way it is.

122
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:28,073
I'll be determining whether
you pass or fail.

123
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,992
Bring your complete set
of Ninja tools!

124
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,618
We meet at five in the morning.

125
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,292
N-No way am I going to be
dropped now!

126
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,546
I've got to have my strength
recognized for real.

127
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,176
I'll be separated from Sasuke
if I fail this test.

128
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,510
This is an exercise of love!

129
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,559
Okay! You're dismissed.

130
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,979
Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.

131
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,731
You'll throw up.

132
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,077
Morning.

133
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,775
Hi, folks. Good morning!

134
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,736
You're late!

135
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,241
Well, a black cat crossed
my path, you see.

136
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,245
Ahem! Oh well...

137
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,541
Okay, it's set for 12:00!

138
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:10,467
Today's assignment is to take
these bells away from me by noon.

139
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,473
Those who can't do it won't get lunch.

140
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,433
They'll be tied to that...

141
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,395
and I'll eat my lunch
before your very eyes.

142
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,481
So that was the point...

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,358
for us not to eat breakfast...

144
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,277
But, hold on.

145
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,820
Why are there only two bells?

146
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,073
There are only two,
so at the very least,

147
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,866
one will have to go to the logs.

148
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,786
That person will be disqualified
for failing the mission...

149
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,788
and will return to the Academy.

150
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,582
It might be one person
at the very least,

151
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,751
or it could be all three of you.

152
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,254
You can use your Shuriken.

153
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,590
You won't be able to take the bells
unless you come with the intent to kill me.

154
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,136
But, that's dangerous, sir!

155
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,762
Y-Yeah, that's right!

156
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,597
You couldn't even evade
a chalkboard eraser!

157
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,474
In this world,

158
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,185
those who aren't skilled enough
tend to complain more.

159
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,563
Well, just ignore the loser...

160
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,983
Begin when I give
the "ready-go" signal.

161
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,985
Loser, loser, loser.

162
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,838
Don't be so hasty.
I didn't say start, yet.

163
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,597
No way...!

164
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,140
I didn't see him at all.

165
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,559
So this is a Jonin.

166
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,269
But, that's fine.

167
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,564
At least you came with
the intent to kill me.

168
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,984
How can I put this...?

169
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,487
I feel like I'm finally starting...
to like you guys.

170
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,198
We're going to start.

171
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,659
Ready...start!

172
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,457
What do you want to know?

173
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,504
I didn't think you just
came here to drink tea.

174
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,590
The Jonin in Naruto and company's
Group Seven...

175
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,345
What kind of teacher is he?
Is he strict?

176
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,682
You mean Kakashi?
Does he concern you?

177
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,104
I heard a rumor that concerns me.

178
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,404
What's this?

179
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,782
It's a pass-fail list of
the junior ninjas

180
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,201
Kakashi has been
in charge of up until now.

181
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,496
Let me have a look.

182
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,295
T-This is...!

183
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,928
Fundamentally, ninja must mask
their presence and hide.

184
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,064
Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...

185
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,279
Alright! Let's face off
fair and square!

186
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,447
Oh?

187
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,949
That goof.

188
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,119
Say, aren't you a bit
off kilter?

189
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,122
What's off kilter
is your hairstyle!

190
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,804
I'll teach you the first
Shinobi Battle Jutsu...

191
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,348
Taijutsu.

192
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,186
Taijutsu...?

193
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,770
That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...

194
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,773
That being said...
he's going to use weapons?

195
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:00,989
Make-Out Paradise

196
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,911
What's the matter?
Why don't you come at me?

197
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,414
But hey...what's with the book?

198
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,458
Why do you ask...?

199
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,377
It's because I was curious
about what happens next.

200
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,379
Don't worry.

201
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,506
With you guys as opponents,

202
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,424
it makes no difference
if I'm reading or not.

203
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,012
I'm going to rip you apart!

204
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,309
Darn! This time a spin kick!

205
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,187
Man!

206
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:35,941
Wha...?!

207
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,903
Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them
from behind multiple times, fool.

208
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,364
The way his hands are positioned...

209
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,407
Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!

210
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,492
No way!

211
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,618
With Naruto as his opponent,

212
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,620
that's too strong a Ninjutsu
no matter how you look at it.

213
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,957
That Sign...
It's a fire-style skill.

214
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,585
That idiot teacher's doing more
than just running around?

215
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,546
Naruto, get out of there quick!

216
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,256
You'll die!

217
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,216
Too late.

218
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,636
Leaf Village Secret!
Ultimate Taijutsu!

219
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,309
One Thousand Years of Death!

220
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,272
Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.

221
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,025
Those two are idiots.

222
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,574
Alright...

223
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,584
Even so, isn't that against the rules?

224
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,920
What're we supposed to do
about his strength?

225
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,093
Darn it!

226
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,595
It wasn't supposed to be
like this.

227
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,191
It...can't be!

228
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,444
This is more than just a rumor.

229
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,282
Kakashi's test might
be a bit difficult...

230
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,162
Even so, this means absolutely
no one has passed...!

231
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,580
That's right...

232
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,334
Kakashi has never had someone pass.

233
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,710
They have all...

234
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,337
been annihilated...

235
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,552
What's the matter?

236
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,306
You won't get lunch if you can't
take the bell by noon.

237
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,059
I know that, I say.

238
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,102
You're not very energetic,

239
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,438
considering you said that
you'd surpass the Hokage.

240
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:43,318
Darn it! Darn it!
I can fight even if I'm hungry.

241
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,241
I didn't even have dinner last night.

242
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
I shouldn't have gone on a diet.

243
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,415
I just got a bit careless earlier!

244
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:01,211
Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...

245
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,382
But...I've got to take the bell,
no matter what.

246
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,384
No matter what...

247
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,844
I'm...not...

248
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,722
turning back now!

249
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,561
I'm going to become a Ninja!

250
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,948
Security is your greatest enemy!

251
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,785
Now for my favorite
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

252
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,496
Seven...Narutos?

253
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,128
What? They're not just images?

254
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,464
Are they all real?
The real thing?

255
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,099
Not the clone,
but the shadow clone, eh.

256
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:01,855
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

257
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,190
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

258
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,869
Those aren't just images
but actual clones!

259
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,495
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!

260
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,125
It's the forbidden Jutsu
that did in Mizuki.

261
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,379
Judging from your ability,

262
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,090
that Jutsu should have
a one-minute limit.

263
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,051
Even if you talk trash,

264
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,053
Naruto is Naruto
after all is said and done...

265
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,515
You still can't beat me with that skill.

266
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,437
W-What?! Behind me?!

267
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,613
Ninja shouldn't let
the enemy take them from behind.

268
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,364
Right, Kakashi Sensei?

269
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,700
Using the Shadow Clone,

270
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,910
I had one of them come up

271
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,330
from the bottom of the river
and sneak behind you!

272
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,291
Here's one for that attack
on my butt earlier!

273
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,794
Naruto, not bad!

274
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,004
So...a diversionary tactic, eh?

275
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,966
Now...allow me to punch you!

276
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,560
What?!

277
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,069
The one who got punched was...

278
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,280
Naruto?

279
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,325
Ouch!

280
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,701
You...!

281
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,246
You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!

282
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,623
You used the Transformation Jutsu
to change yourself, didn't you?!

283
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,334
-It's you!
-You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.

284
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,545
You smell like Kakashi Sensei!

285
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,505
The smell of an old guy!

286
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,006
Why you...!

287
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,969
Hey! For the time being,
let's try undoing the Jutsu.

288
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,972
If we do that,
only the two will remain...so...

289
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,849
You should've realized that sooner,
you idiot!

290
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,811
You're me, you idiot!
Just undo the Jutsu!

291
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,487
Naruto...

292
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,864
You're embarrassing to watch...

293
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,825
That was the Substitution Jutsu,
you fool.

294
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,495
Essentially, it's a skill used
to quickly switch one's own body

295
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,914
with an object or animal.

296
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,334
This makes your enemy think
you're being attacked,

297
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,420
but then you strike during
their unguarded moment.

298
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:35,508
After letting himself get caught
by the real Naruto,

299
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,220
the Jonin fool switched bodies
with one of the clone Narutos.

300
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,681
Not only did he make Naruto
think he'd been nailed...

301
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,143
he used Naruto's own attack on him.

302
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,567
A bell?!

303
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,570
You really must have been in a hurry.

304
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,405
You've dropped a bell!

305
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,746
What the heck is this?!

306
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,250
Of course it's a trap...

307
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,253
H-H-Hey!

308
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:18,217
That jonin doesn't lower his guard
even when he's fighting Naruto.

309
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,178
The bell!

310
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,435
You have to think when using Jutsu.

311
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,438
They can be used against you.

312
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,024
Also...

313
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,612
...don't get caught in
an obvious trap, you fool.

314
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,325
A Ninja must see
through deception!

315
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,662
I know that, I say!

316
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,498
You know, I'm telling you
because you don't get it.

317
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,791
Listen up!

318
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,461
Your movements are wasteful.

319
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,797
Now!

320
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,843
He finally dropped his guard!

321
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,929
You're so...

322
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,101
No way!

323
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,477
You jerk Sasuke!

324
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,770
You're overdoing it!

325
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,999
Darn it!

326
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,794
At this rate, there's no way
I can beat Kakashi Sensei.

327
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,754
But if I don't take the bell...
I won't get lunch...

328
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,048
No...I'll fail the test!

329
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,093
He says a Ninja must see
through deception,

330
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,303
but I have no idea what that means.

331
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,638
How in the world can I take
the bell back

332
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,766
from Kakashi Sensei?!

333
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,645
Next episode:
"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision"

334
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,356
Don't miss my outstanding performance!
