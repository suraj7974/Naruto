1
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,302
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,270
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,690
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,986
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,573
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,036
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,457
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,962
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,260
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,137
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,099
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,059
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,562
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:10,196
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,908
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,161
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,584
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,254
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,562
Hey, you!

21
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,815
Are you sure you want
to look like that?

22
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,317
Yes, of course!
C'mon! So hurry hurry!

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,779
Don't regret it later.

24
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,740
Say cheese!

25
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,706
My Name Is Konohamaru!

26
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,058
I couldn't decide on how to look.

27
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,602
It took me 3 hours to decide.

28
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,815
But as you can see,
it's more like a work of art.

29
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,483
Doesn't it look great?

30
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,901
Take it over.

31
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,319
What?!

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,781
Take it over.

33
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,242
Stop saying that!

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,624
Transform!

35
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,422
Oh please, Lord Hokage...

36
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:12,067
The Sexy Jutsu...
That's quite a devious technique.

37
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,448
By the way Naruto,
where's your headband?

38
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,160
I won't wear it until the orientation.
It might get scratched

39
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,495
Well, that's just fine.

40
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,958
But the Ninja Registration Form
is a very important document

41
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,295
held in high regard by our village.

42
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,673
Why do you want to look like this?

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,842
Because!

44
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,762
Anyway, how should I know
about all that stuff?

45
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,600
Old man!
Get ready to fight!

46
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,313
I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!

47
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,110
Ouch!

48
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,030
If it's not one thing, it's another...

49
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,409
Drat! Is this a trap?

50
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,165
Are you okay,
Honorable Grandson?

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,501
May I just inform you that
there aren't any traps here...

52
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,379
Huh? What's with this runt?

53
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,880
What?!

54
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:20,928
I know this kid...
He's that Nine-Tailed boy!

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,806
He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!

56
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,142
You must have done this to me!

57
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,187
You tripped all by yourself, stupid!

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,940
Hey! Let go of him!

59
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,151
He is the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage!

60
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,449
He stopped as soon as
he learned who I am...

61
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,328
He's like my four-eyed teacher.

62
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,622
He's just like everyone else!

63
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,082
What's the matter?

64
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,084
Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?

65
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,712
Can't do it 'cuz
I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,424
As if I care!
Imbecile!

67
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,552
This guy...

68
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,889
What?!

69
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,100
Good grief...

70
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,104
Listen to me.

71
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,774
You are the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage.

72
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:21,947
Even though that scoundrel hit you,
you must not associate with his kind.

73
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,077
Nothing good will come of
your tangling with him.

74
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,329
This is your distinguished
teacher Ebisu,

75
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,248
and I am never wrong
about these things!

76
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,044
Don't you want to become
the Fifth Hokage?

77
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,005
Then allow me
to teach you Ninjutsu,

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,215
so that your dream will
become a reality.

79
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,508
That's right.

80
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:47,222
Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.

81
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,184
Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?

82
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,189
He's gone!

83
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,525
It seems he's gone after Naruto.

84
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,652
Oh no!
This is terrible!

85
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,613
Honorable Grandson!

86
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:08,160
How did he become like this?

87
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:14,083
That was the 20th sneak attack today.

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,712
And now he's in the company of Naruto.
I'm a bit worried.

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,093
I just hope he doesn't pick up
more foolishness.

90
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,691
Huh?

91
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,011
Stop following me!
What is it now?!

92
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,225
Your camouflage is pathetic.

93
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,315
You've seen through my disguise...

94
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,151
Your reputation is well-earned.

95
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,489
I will allow you to make me
your apprentice.

96
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,161
But you must first teach me that
"Sexy Jutsu" technique

97
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,371
you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.

98
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,832
You gotta be kidding.

99
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,334
I beg you to say yes, boss!

100
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,752
Huh?

101
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,837
Boss?

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,506
Boss! Boss! Boss!

103
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,968
I guess I have no choice.

104
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,556
Listen.

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,892
In order to become a skilled Ninja,

106
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,352
you must first learn to
control your Chatora.

107
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,146
Chatora?

108
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,443
Yes, Chatora.

109
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,821
Boss, I think you mean Chakra.

110
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,866
Silence!
That's what real Ninjas call it!

111
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,285
Oh! I didn't know that!

112
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,247
Whew... I'm glad he's a fool.

113
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,459
Listen. Chakra essentially means...

114
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,338
Basically, it is the energy needed
in order to use Jutsu.

115
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,547
Huh?

116
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,926
In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts
combine the Chakra,

117
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,388
the physical energy accumulated
from each cell in the body

118
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,892
with spiritual energy intensified
through training and experience.

119
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,604
This combined energy is summoned
with certain hand signs.

120
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,980
You made me think
you knew all that,

121
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,398
when you were just reading
from a scroll!

122
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,194
Much has been said about
perfecting the Ninja techniques,

123
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,405
but it really boils down
to just one thing.

124
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,366
And what is that?

125
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,660
Hard work and guts.

126
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,578
Hard work and guts?

127
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,788
That's right.

128
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,624
So be ready for the challenging tasks
I will give you.

129
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,292
Yes, boss!

130
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,587
Good. Let's start right now.
Transform for me.

131
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,047
Huh?

132
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,759
Let me see first
how much you already know.

133
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,263
But what do I transform into?

134
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,108
OK... First, transform into that lady.

135
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,068
An easy task, boss.

136
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,488
Transform!

137
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,491
Well, do I look like her?

138
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,873
Uhm... Well, the clothes do and...

139
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,960
And what's so similar
about that?!

140
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,754
Honorable Grandson.

141
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,591
If you will transform into me,
at least try to look a little cuter, OK?

142
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,428
She's scary!

143
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,391
Why am I the one who gets hit?

144
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,981
OK!
Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!

145
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,524
Yes, boss!

146
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,416
I told you I don't allow
reading here, Naruto!

147
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:36,261
This is the last test.
Put all of your effort into it!

148
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,804
Yes, boss!

149
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,389
Transform!

150
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,865
Naruto! It's you again!

151
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,829
Why is it always me...?

152
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,290
-Sorry.
-Huh?

153
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,543
It's because
I'm the Hokage's grandson.

154
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,505
Don't worry about it.

155
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,756
Huh?

156
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,385
You're now ready to perform
the Sexy Jutsu!

157
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,721
You just need more practice.

158
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,226
Yes, boss!

159
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,854
OK, keep in mind...
the point is for "boom boom boom"!

160
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:28,939
Now do it!

161
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,400
Yes, boss!
Transform!

162
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,446
What do you think?

163
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,616
That won't do!

164
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,743
More slender.

165
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,245
Yes, boss!

166
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,288
Is this okay?

167
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,083
Not yet.
More attractive.

168
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,459
Yes, boss!

169
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,586
How about now?

170
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,553
That Naruto... What is he teaching
the Honorable Grandson...?

171
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,016
Where the hell could they be...?

172
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:10,814
I am a distinguished teacher
training potential Hokage.

173
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,986
All those who interfere
will be eliminated.

174
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,259
You know I've been wondering...

175
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,804
You seem obsessed with beating
your Grandpa Hokage.

176
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,351
My name is Konohamaru.

177
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,438
It was Grandpa who gave me
that name.

178
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,940
He named me after our village.

179
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,696
It should be easy for everyone
here to remember.

180
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,782
But nobody ever calls me
by that name.

181
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:09,372
When they see me, all they see
is the grandson of Lord Hokage.

182
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,127
No one sees me for who I really am.

183
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,088
I can't stand it anymore.

184
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,715
That's why...

185
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,802
That's why I want the title
of Lord Hokage now.

186
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,601
Idiot...Who do you think
will accept you, huh?

187
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,685
Huh?

188
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,481
You won't win the title
that easily, you know.

189
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,565
What?!

190
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,318
It's not that simple.

191
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,740
If you're really serious about gaining
the title of Lord Hokage...

192
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,867
What?

193
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,622
You'll have to beat me first!

194
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,432
Lord Hokage!
I've been looking for you.

195
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,059
Iruka.

196
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,438
Did Naruto re-submit
his Ninja Registration Form?

197
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,523
Yes.

198
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,151
When I lectured to him the other night
at the ramen stand,

199
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,781
he said he will make everyone accept him
now that he's a Ninja.

200
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,741
He's been happy since then.

201
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:37,043
It might not be easy for Naruto
to realize that dream.

202
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,169
Huh?

203
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,131
As you well know,

204
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:46,720
only the villagers who fought
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago

205
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:51,224
know that the monster is sealed
inside Naruto.

206
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,687
I ruled that no one shall speak
about that incident.

207
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,733
I have severely punished those
who have broken this rule.

208
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,279
Now our children know nothing about it.

209
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,657
That is the only positive
development for Naruto.

210
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:13,496
Before the Fourth Hokage trapped
the monster and died,

211
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,499
his last wish was for the villagers
to regard Naruto as a hero.

212
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,626
A hero?

213
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,964
The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster
into the navel of a newborn baby

214
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,133
whose umbilical cord
had just been cut.

215
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,345
As the receptacle
for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

216
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,306
Naruto saved the village.

217
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,561
Unfortunately, the other villagers
don't see him like that.

218
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:42,025
Some even say that Naruto is
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.

219
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,612
Little by little, that attitude

220
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,742
has been
passed down to their own children.

221
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,580
Iruka.
Do you know?

222
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,499
What, sir?

223
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:02,337
When someone is hated and people refuse
to accept his existence,

224
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,717
he sees it in the eyes
of the people around him.

225
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,934
I have found you!

226
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,018
Huh?

227
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,857
That Demon Fox!!

228
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,862
That cold look!
It's always like that!

229
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,325
Honorable Grandson,
we have to go now.

230
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,702
No way!

231
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,080
I want to beat Grandpa right now
so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!

232
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,124
Don't get in my way!

233
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,378
A Hokage must first know about virtue,
honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,

234
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,338
judgment, obedience
and all that.

235
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,341
He must be skilled at more than
thousand techniques... And then...

236
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,301
Transform!

237
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,016
Take this! Sexy Jutsu!

238
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,229
What?
It didn't work!

239
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,983
What kind of a
disgraceful spell is that?!

240
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,152
I am a gentleman!

241
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:11,448
Such vulgar attacks
will never work on me!

242
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:17,078
Honorable Grandson!
That rascal will only make you an imbecile!

243
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,165
Stick with me and...

244
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,251
you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.

245
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,170
C'mon, let's go!

246
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,254
No way!

247
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,381
Shadow Clone Jutsu

248
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,891
Wow!
Fantastic!

249
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,399
Ha!
That's nothing.

250
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,027
I am a distinguished teacher.

251
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,821
I am not as weak as Mizuki.

252
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:07,796
Boss...

253
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,802
Transform!

254
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,554
Transform!

255
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,937
Oh, Master Ebisu...

256
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,658
I call it "the Harem Jutsu"!

257
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,664
He combined the Multiple Clones with
his own Sexy Jutsu.

258
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,959
That's another devious attack.

259
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,046
I probably won't even survive that one.

260
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,930
I can't even beat that
four-eyed teacher of mine!

261
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,642
I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!
I want to be recognized by everybody!

262
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,519
But I keep failing.

263
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,896
You think it's that easy?

264
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,356
Huh?

265
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,901
It's given only to the greatest Ninja
in the village.

266
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,863
Everybody must learn to believe in you.

267
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,243
I've been through a lot already.

268
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,246
It's been one struggle after another.

269
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,459
But after all that,
I found someone who accepts me.

270
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,796
I had to go through a lot...
Just for one person.

271
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,592
You had better push yourself.

272
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,676
For what?

273
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:43,641
The path of getting the title,
Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.

274
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,570
There's no such thing as a shortcut.

275
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,952
If you're really serious about
attaining the title of Lord Hokage

276
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,622
You'll have to beat me first.

277
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,004
Who do you think you are,
lecturing me like that?

278
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,966
I won't be your apprentice anymore.

279
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,016
From now on, you're my rival.

280
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,983
Unfortunately for you,
tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.

281
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:40,406
Still, I'll consider you an equal someday
when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.

282
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,995
Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.

283
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:15,692
You still have a long way to go
to become a real Ninja.

284
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,751
Aaah! Why do I have to be in
the same group with Sasuke?

285
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,586
The guy I hate the most?

286
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,379
Sakura keeps saying
"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!"

287
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,048
and doesn't even
pay attention to me!

288
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:07,136
It makes me so mad!
I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!

289
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,723
I'm not gonna let him be so cool
in front of Sakura!

290
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,060
Next Episode:
"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?"

291
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,105
Watch my outstanding performance!
