1
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:20,146
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,899
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,622
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,587
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,383
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,511
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,603
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,700
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,412
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,923
and melting away

17
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,927
Who're you guys?

18
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,164
I'm in a bad mood right now.

19
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,960
If you wanna continue to fight,

20
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,294
I won't go easy on you.

21
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:15,135
You stop your babbling, weakling.

22
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,807
Hey, come over here.

23
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,893
I'm gonna play
do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do on you...

24
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,103
while I snap your ribs!

25
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,313
I'll do it!

26
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,664
What?! He got both of my legs
with his string...!

27
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,383
Why you...!

28
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,850
Let's hear a nice sound.

29
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,560
Do!

30
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,771
W-What?!

31
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,481
Re!

32
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,948
Wh-Where is he attacking from?!

33
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,996
Your bones make
a really low sound, don't they?

34
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,958
Let's hear a much sharper reverberation,
shall we?

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,919
Right?

36
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,696
Next, I'll go for
a mi-fa-so tri-combination.

37
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,410
Wha...?!

38
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,124
What?!

39
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,424
Last!

40
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,053
Lions Barrage!

41
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,518
An Invitation from the Sound

42
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,145
Here you are!

43
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,064
I'm digging in!

44
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,277
Sakura! Go on, eat, eat!

45
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,240
The Chinese-style barbecued pork
ramen noodles here are fabulous!

46
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,120
Don't worry. It's my treat.

47
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,746
Right, chef?

48
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,915
You're gonna treat your girl.

49
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,084
You're growing up, aren't you, Naruto?

50
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,044
Wh-Wh-What?!

51
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,130
Wh-What the heck are
you talking about?

52
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,550
I need to have an important conversation
with Sakura today...

53
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,219
Sh-She's not my girl
or anything like that...

54
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,513
Sakura?

55
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,643
Sorry, Naruto. I was little spaced out.

56
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,854
This looks delicious.

57
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,565
Now then... Let's eat! Let's eat!

58
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:19,653
Yeah! Tell me about Sasuke
while we eat.

59
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:44,303
Sasuke told me not to tell you this,
Naruto, but...

60
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,109
It's all that guy Orochimaru's fault...

61
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,992
S-Stop!

62
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,880
Kakashi Sensei said it would be fine
and I'd like to believe that too...

63
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,884
But when he was battling Gaara...

64
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,684
Earlier today...

65
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,770
Sasuke was wearing the same expression
as the time before.

66
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,397
That's why I...

67
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,408
Orochimaru, huh?
I ran into him again a little while back.

68
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,577
Really? Where?!

69
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,456
When I was searching for
Old Lady Tsunade...

70
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,128
Die!

71
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,298
Shoot!

72
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,769
Pervy Sage and the old lady...

73
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,771
Despite the fact that
he was fighting two of them at once,

74
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,356
he was incredibly powerful.

75
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,568
He's one dangerous dude.

76
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,279
That strong...

77
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,323
It'll all be fine, believe it!

78
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,412
Sasuke wouldn't fall to
that kind of guy's enticement.

79
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,122
He's already a really powerful guy,

80
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,416
so he wouldn't need to do
that kind of thing!

81
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,255
I guarantee it!

82
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,680
Yeah!

83
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:05,360
Why does Master Orochimaru
want this guy anyway?

84
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,864
Kimimaro would have
been much better...

85
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,746
Well, if you stay in
a seedy place like this,

86
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,832
you'll just remain mediocre at best.

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,168
You'll never become strong...

88
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,754
Wh-Why...?

89
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,674
All my barrages were solid.
Yet this guy...

90
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,384
doesn't seem to have
sustained any damage.

91
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,097
If you keep on fooling around
playing Ninja with your friends,

92
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,350
you're just gonna continue to rot.

93
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,230
Come with us.

94
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:45,484
If you do,
Master Orochimaru will empower you.

95
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,909
There's no meaning
if we take you by force, he said.

96
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,745
You decide.

97
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,498
Gimme a break...

98
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,750
Master Orochimaru sure sent me
on a bothersome mission.

99
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,377
Hey! What did you decide?

100
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,420
Are you coming?

101
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,755
Or are you not coming?!

102
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,677
Decide already!

103
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,306
When a weakling like you lags,

104
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,100
it makes me wanna just finish you!

105
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,645
Try me...!

106
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,074
You...those Curse Marks...

107
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,129
Don't be so sure that

108
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,257
you're the only favorite
of Master Orochimaru.

109
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,720
One shouldn't use Curse Marks
that lightly.

110
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,350
Or rather...it looks like you're not
even able to control the Curse Marks.

111
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,645
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,

112
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,690
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.

113
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,776
It looks like you're still at first state,

114
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,112
so the speed at which they will
eat away at you is still fairly slow.

115
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,906
But when they have entirely eaten you,

116
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,784
you will lose yourself.

117
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,369
Forever.

118
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,667
In exchange for having been
empowered by Curse Marks,

119
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,045
you will be tethered
by Master Orochimaru.

120
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,547
We no longer have anything
like freedom.

121
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,052
In order to receive something,
one must discard something.

122
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,139
What is your objective?

123
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,224
Are you and your comrades
just going to comfort each other

124
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,352
in this lukewarm village...

125
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,479
then simply forget all about...

126
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,564
Itachi Uchiha?

127
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,278
Don't forget your objective.

128
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,282
This kind of village does
nothing more than shackle you!

129
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,411
Cut your stupid ties with this place.

130
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,413
If you do that, you'll...

131
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,667
be able to obtain much,
more fabulous power.

132
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,295
Don't forget your objective!

133
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,530
Thanks!

134
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,365
H-Hey Sakura.

135
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,950
I'll walk you home!

136
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,201
Huh? Don't worry about it.

137
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,579
Why, why?
The streets are dangerous at night!

138
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,167
They're well lit, so I'll be fine...

139
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,051
Sakura?

140
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,263
Thanks, Naruto.

141
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,683
But I want to go home alone tonight.

142
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,393
I see...

143
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,562
I'll be fine!

144
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,522
Yeah!

145
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,705
Why are you hanging around in a place
like this in the middle of the night?

146
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,335
One has to pass down this road
to leave the village.

147
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,672
Go home and sleep.

148
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,354
Why...

149
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,941
Why won't you tell me anything?

150
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,111
Why are you always silent like that?

151
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,655
You won't tell me one single thing.

152
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,116
Why should I have to tell you anything?!

153
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,996
I'm telling you to keep your nose
out of my business.

154
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,707
Stop bothering me
over everything I do.

155
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,215
I...make you dislike me
all the time, don't I?

156
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,927
Do you remember?

157
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,766
We just became Genin and
the Three-Man Squads were assigned...

158
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,104
You and I were alone for
the first time, here at this very spot.

159
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,107
You got mad at me.

160
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,068
See! That guy doesn't
have parents, right?

161
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,157
He's all alone and he doesn't have to deal
with parents lecturing him...

162
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,242
That's why he can sometimes
be selfish!

163
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,495
Solitude...

164
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,747
Huh?

165
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,251
Isn't the same as being scolded
by one's parents.

166
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,795
What's the matter all of a sudden...

167
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,174
You...are annoying...

168
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,900
I don't remember that.

169
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,369
Yeah, I guess...
that was long ago, after all...

170
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,122
But it all began that day.

171
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,957
Sasuke and me...

172
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,253
And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei...

173
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,736
The four of us went
on various missions, didn't we?

174
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,409
Those were tough and
difficult times, but...

175
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,086
But...

176
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,006
more than anything...

177
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,142
it was so much fun!

178
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,318
I know about your family, Sasuke...

179
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,988
But revenge...

180
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,908
that won't bring anyone happiness.

181
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,619
No one...

182
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,372
Neither you...

183
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
nor I.

184
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:26,963
As I expected...

185
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,427
I'm different from you guys...

186
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,930
I'm walking a road that's incompatible
with the rest of you.

187
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,349
The four of us worked together...

188
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,854
and it's true that there was a time
when I thought that was my road.

189
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,774
The four of us have worked together,

190
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,651
but in the end,
I decided on revenge.

191
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,906
That's been my reason for living.

192
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,496
I can't become like
you and Naruto.

193
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,081
Are you going to isolate
yourself again, Sasuke?!

194
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:06,085
You taught me that solitude
is a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!

195
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,047
Now I know exactly how that feels.

196
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,510
I have both family and friends...

197
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,888
But if you were no longer here, Sasuke...

198
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,765
for me...

199
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,728
for me it would be the same as solitude.

200
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,653
From here again...

201
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,573
we're going to start walking
our new paths individually.

202
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,200
I...!

203
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,537
I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!

204
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,957
If you would only be with me, Sasuke,

205
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,042
I won't let you regret it,
no matter what!

206
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,129
I'll make it fun every day and
you will definitely find happiness!

207
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,676
I'll do anything for you, Sasuke!

208
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,513
So...I'm begging you,
please stay here!

209
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,432
I'll even help you with your revenge!

210
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,519
I'll make it happen somehow,
I promise you...!

211
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,815
So stay here...with me...!

212
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,694
If that doesn't work for you...

213
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,949
Then take me with you...

214
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,626
You really are...annoying.

215
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,298
Don't go!

216
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,093
If you go, I'll scream and...

217
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,851
Sakura...

218
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,399
Thank you...

219
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,707
Sasuke...

220
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,308
We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.

221
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,604
What's your intention?

222
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,316
It was already decided that
you would be our leader

223
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,611
the moment you exited the village.

224
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,573
Please forgive our rudeness
up to now.

225
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,205
I don't care about any of that.

226
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,379
Let's go.

227
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,929
This is the beginning!

228
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,817
Once in a long while,

229
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,445
once in a while

230
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:25,159
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

231
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:30,331
Look like a mountain

232
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,005
Clinging to the Divine,

233
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,800
clinging to Buddha

234
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:46,514
The remnants of a person crying

235
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,268
Look like a mountain

236
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,939
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

237
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,152
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

238
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,071
Shake shake shake
Let's look

239
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,325
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

240
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,590
Look like a mountain

241
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,095
Look like a mountain

242
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,557
Look like a mountain

243
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,936
Look like a mountain

244
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,151
What? That jerk Sasuke.

245
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,696
What the heck is he thinking?
He has such a twisted personality!

246
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,574
What is it that he disliked so much
that he'd do something like this?!

247
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:51,037
Damn! I'm not about to let that guy
do whatever he wants!

248
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,082
If things come to this, I'll chase him
down to the end of the world.

249
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,794
I'll drag that guy back
even if I have to grab him by his neck!

250
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,048
Next time:
"Formation! The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!"
