1
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,602
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,818
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,862
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,324
Down a difficult road filled
with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:40,416
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,753
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,173
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,010
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,705
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,250
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,671
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,010
Water Style!

23
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,140
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,772
The same Jutsu as me?!

25
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,609
Why have you shown up too?

26
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,738
Well...I asked you to
take care of them earlier.

27
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,033
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.

28
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,206
What business does a Rogue Ninja like you

29
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,959
have in this village now?

30
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,967
Kakashi Hatake...

31
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,054
Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,658
What?! Why?! Why?!

33
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,246
Why do I have to go on a research
trip with you, Pervy Sage?

34
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,084
Oh no, this isn't just any research trip.

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,878
There's a woman
whose data I want to collect.

36
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,212
So we have to look for her first.

37
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,800
I really don't have time to accompany
you on your perverted research trip!

38
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,719
Because I have training!

39
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,554
Hm? Training?

40
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,889
I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei

41
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,683
and learn a variety of things,
like Chidori!

42
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,438
Kakashi Sensei has been
playing favorites lately!

43
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,148
Well,

44
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,152
I think that technique is
impossible for you to learn.

45
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,905
More importantly...

46
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,699
That woman is really beautiful.

47
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,118
-You want to meet her, don't you?!
-Not at all.

48
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,916
I'm not some kid who can be
cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!

49
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,584
Anyway, no!

50
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,545
Well, it can't be helped...

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,881
Oh, well...

52
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,009
I know Jutsu more amazing
than Chidori, but...

53
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,722
It can't be helped...
Maybe I'll take Sasuke?

54
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,559
Of course I'll go!

55
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,395
I'll pack my bags right away.

56
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,357
Pervy Sage, don't move!

57
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,947
I'll be darned... He's really a cute kid.

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,129
Those eyes are exactly the same
as they used to be in the past.

59
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,925
That being said,
he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan...

60
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,345
I have to assume the worst-case scenario,
just in case.

61
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,141
This is a surprise... No wonder
you copied my Jutsu...

62
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,605
So there really is a fellow
besides Itachi who has that eye.

63
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,567
Your name is Kakashi,
the Copy Ninja, wasn't it?

64
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,112
I'm the one who was surprised.

65
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,532
I saw strange men in the tea house
and wondered who they were...

66
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,994
There they were Itachi Uchiha and...

67
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,498
the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village,
Kisame Hoshigaki.

68
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,876
Well, well... You know even my name.

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,211
It's an honor.

70
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,633
I see. You're one of
the "Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist."

71
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,177
That huge sword is
the "Shark Skin," right?

72
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,642
I heard that kid Zabuza
had it out with you?

73
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,853
Yeah...

74
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,527
You are someone who's
well worth lopping off...

75
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,654
Stop it... Kisame.

76
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,579
If you were to go at it with that man,
it won't end without cost.

77
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,373
And if you spend too much time,

78
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,959
another Shinobi would come running.

79
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,044
However...

80
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,838
Don't lose sight of the goal...

81
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,758
You didn't come here to get injured!

82
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,303
Let me hear that "goal" then...?

83
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,273
Just came to find
something we're looking for.

84
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,234
Something you're looking for?

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,967
The thing you're looking for... What is it?

86
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,183
I'm different from Kisame,
I won't take time.

87
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,605
Ninja Art: Water Style. Water wall!

88
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,118
That's some Jutsu speed.
My eyes couldn't follow the Sign.

89
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,954
That Shuriken in the right
hand was a decoy...

90
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,998
to use a Water Style Jutsu to
launch an attack below my foot ...

91
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,459
That's what to expect from you, Kakashi.

92
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:02,005
Your power of analytical eye...is great.

93
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,843
A Shadow Clone?!
His Jutsu speed is too fast!

94
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,139
A water clone?!

95
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,811
The Copy Ninja has done well
this far with Jutsu of my village.

96
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,399
Nice! Kakashi!

97
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,317
Get down, Kurenai!

98
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,778
-This one is the Shadow Clone...
-Huh?

99
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,575
Kakashi! Kurenai!

100
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,994
He made the Shadow Clone body explode?!

101
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,417
A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.

102
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,046
Sakura's going to start to like me...

103
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,381
Maybe!

104
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,052
Kakashi Sensei and
Sasuke will be surprised!

105
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,897
Kakashi...!

106
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,446
Don't lower your guard...

107
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,366
He's the guy who became a division chief
of Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old...

108
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,993
To think he's this powerful...

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,414
No, you haven't seen
this guy's strength yet.

110
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,711
I didn't expect that you who are
not a member of the Uchiha clan

111
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,130
would have mastered
the Sharingan to that extent...

112
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,217
But your body isn't the "Uchiha clan" body

113
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,136
that goes with the eye.

114
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,599
That's right. As a result,
my stamina doesn't last...

115
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,063
There's a reason why the Uchiha Clan
was deemed the strongest and feared...

116
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:49,029
I'll demonstrate the true strength
of Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!

117
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,450
I-It can't be! This is bad!

118
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,954
Both of you! Don't look at his eyes!

119
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,417
Both of you! Don't look at his eyes!

120
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,466
Both of you,
absolutely do not open your eyes...

121
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,094
It's all over now if your eyes meet.

122
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,098
Only people with Sharingan can
have a go with that technique.

123
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,101
Indeed with Sharingan,

124
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,521
you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan
to a certain extent.

125
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,523
However...

126
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,403
this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,

127
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,655
Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi,
Nightmare Realm, is unbreakable.

128
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,449
The only person who can
bring me down is someone

129
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,953
using the same Kekkei Genkai,
a Sharingan user...

130
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,003
Sasuke...

131
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,275
I wonder how much you can
take without the Kekkei Genkai?

132
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,668
The one just now was...Genjutsu?

133
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,171
In the world of Tsukuyomi...

134
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,091
Both space and time...

135
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,305
and mass... I control them all.

136
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,393
For the next 72 hours...

137
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,021
I'll stab you continually with swords.

138
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,123
That's...

139
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,001
In the world of Tsukuyomi...

140
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,837
Both space and time...

141
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,802
and mass... I control them all.

142
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,640
Calm down...

143
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,725
This is Genjutsu.

144
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,146
It's best not to be optimistic
and think it's an illusion.

145
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,696
This pain is not an illusion.

146
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,661
This pain is absolutely
no different from reality.

147
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,172
How long will your spirit sustain?

148
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:34,379
There's... 71 hours 59
minutes 59 seconds left.

149
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,301
Wha...?! S-Since then...?!

150
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,516
That's all the time that has passed?!

151
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,405
What happened, Kakashi?!

152
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,366
Are you saying we should
keep our eyes closed still?!

153
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,204
N-Not...yet...

154
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,206
What happened?!

155
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,584
Just as that guy finished speaking,
you suddenly fell over!

156
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,422
Three days in that world

157
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,717
is less than a moment in
the actual world, huh...

158
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,180
But...why doesn't he kill me?

159
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,724
He could easily do so, if he wants to...

160
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:15,188
Whoa...To take that Jutsu without
causing his spirit to collapse.

161
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,399
But Itachi...

162
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,610
it's also dangerous for
you to overuse those eyes.

163
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,701
The thing you're looking for...

164
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,077
is it Sasuke?

165
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,039
No...

166
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,084
the legacy of the Fourth Hokage...

167
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,005
These guys.
What the heck are they planning...?

168
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,933
So, Naruto, is it...?

169
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,560
It's been a long time...

170
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,398
How many years has it been
since you returned to the village?

171
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,155
Kakashi...

172
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,535
I will keep Naruto under my care.

173
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,581
It was an understandable
decision of the Third Hokage

174
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,460
who appointed you to the role
of watching over Naruto...

175
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,337
But even at your level,

176
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,882
you may not be able to handle it properly.

177
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,925
What in the world are you saying?

178
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,473
I've been observing Orochimaru

179
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,643
ever since he left the village...

180
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:39,397
It was obvious that he would return
to this village sooner or later.

181
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:44,361
All told, at first I was concerned
only about him, but...

182
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,656
What is it?

183
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,825
The guy joined an organization.

184
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,411
An organization?

185
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,499
What are the details of the organization?

186
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,044
I don't know much of the details,

187
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,215
but it's a small organization known
as Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.

188
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,678
Until recently,
they weren't making any dramatic moves

189
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,888
except some cloak-and-dagger activities.

190
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,224
The biggest concern is
the members of that organization.

191
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,103
Almost all of them are
listed on the Bingo Book,

192
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:22,524
all S-rank deviant criminals.

193
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,070
That Itachi is among them.

194
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,865
If the nine of them get together,

195
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,576
their intent will not be
volunteer activities.

196
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,288
Since you've been told this much,
you already know what it means.

197
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:47,006
But recently,
Orochimaru pulled out of the organization.

198
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,758
And at that time,

199
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,137
other members of the organization
went in to action in different areas,

200
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,472
in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.

201
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,435
Is there proof that one of those
things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?

202
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,896
It's possible.

203
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,901
Because it's one of the spirits
who possess the strongest Chakra...

204
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,572
Kakashi...

205
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,741
Sooner or later,

206
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,035
that Naruto will have to
live watching his back...

207
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,998
That's his destiny.

208
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,463
For now, you should keep
your eyes on Sasuke.

209
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,467
It's necessary for you to teach
him how to use his Sharingan.

210
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:35,221
I'll take care of Naruto for a while.

211
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:46,441
The Nine-Tailed Fox inside
Naruto is your target?

212
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,865
I know that you two aren't
the only ones on the move...

213
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,370
The name of your organization
is Akatsuki, right?

214
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,500
Akatsuki?

215
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,961
Kisame! We'll take Kakashi.

216
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,047
Erase the other two.

217
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,428
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

218
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,148
Who are you?

219
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,861
The Leaf's noble, blue fierce animal...

220
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,322
Mighty Guy!

221
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,866
What a sight...

222
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,535
Shouldn't you be called a strange beast?

223
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,037
Don't underestimate that man...

224
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,998
That man is Itachi!

225
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,926
You did this to Kakashi...?

226
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,929
Don't look at Itachi's eyes, Guy!

227
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,389
You'll be caught up in his Jutsu!

228
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,475
I know that already!

229
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,519
In order to fight Kakashi,

230
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,355
I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.

231
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,776
Open your eyes, both of you!

232
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,237
B-But...

233
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,364
When you battle with the Sharingan,

234
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,533
it's not a problem if
you don't look at those eyes!

235
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,244
You work around it by gaining
insight into his movements

236
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,705
by looking constantly at his feet.

237
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,917
Now that you mention it,
you're probably right, but...

238
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,629
You're the only one who can do that.

239
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,006
That's true...

240
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,593
There's a knack to reading all
of your opponents' movements

241
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,802
only by his feet.

242
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,471
But I can't teach it to
you in this emergency.

243
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,557
Just get used it right now!

244
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,268
What should we do?

245
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,770
Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.

246
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,524
-Asuma, you are my back-up!
-Okay!

247
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:58,031
And until the reinforcements of
Anbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,

248
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,575
I will hang out with you guys.

249
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,537
Interesting... That's some nerve...

250
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,749
Kisame... Pull the plug.

251
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,960
We didn't come to have a war.

252
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,588
It's too bad,
but no more of this nonsense.

253
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,465
We're leaving.

254
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,344
Too bad... I was finally feeling motivated.

255
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,096
It can't be helped.

256
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,277
All right!

257
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,081
Here I go!

258
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,293
Y-You're putting too much spirit into it.

259
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,965
You're not training on a mountain retreat,
you know that, right?

260
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,314
A cycle of hardship, right?

261
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,277
Inside, we were crying, right?

262
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,701
But the one thing we won't give up

263
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,328
is the dream we've chosen, right?

264
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,623
It's a secondary role,

265
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,671
a role in the shadows

266
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,551
But in reaching for that dream,

267
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay centered, let us stay true

268
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,228
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

269
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,941
Over and over, we kept coming back up

270
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,738
Over and over,

271
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,076
we believed and dreamed

272
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,665
Over and over, we've seen fools

273
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:18,046
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

274
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,175
Now, it's our turn...

275
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,889
Let us bask in our dreams

276
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,069
There's a super beautiful
young lady over there!

277
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,570
She just winked at us!

278
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,406
Look, Naruto!
She must be interested in us!

279
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,408
She may be cuter than Sakura!

280
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,494
– All right, Naruto!
– Yeah!

281
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,704
Go back, train, then go to bed.

282
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,624
You always do that to me!

283
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:59,962
Next time: "Jiraiya:
Naruto's Potential Disaster!"

284
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,423
What are we gonna do about my training?!
