1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,978
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,398
Being chased by something

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,777
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,489
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,911
For no single one,

7
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:39,665
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:45,004
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,091
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,926
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,262
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,098
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,601
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,770
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:10,196
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,369
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,292
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,421
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,352
Sasuke here at Point B!

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,437
Sakura here at Point C!

22
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,567
Naruto here. I'm at Point A!

23
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,902
You're slow, Naruto!

24
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,404
Okay, the seventh squad...

25
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,198
Hm?!

26
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,908
The target has moved!

27
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,535
Follow it!

28
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,918
Alright! It's over there!

29
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,340
What's your distance
from the target?

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,053
Five meters!
I can go at anytime!

31
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,013
I'm ready, too!

32
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,515
Me, too...!

33
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,809
Okay...

34
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:24,979
Do it!

35
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,439
Uryaaah!

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,942
I got him!

37
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,319
Does he have the ribbon
on his right ear...?

38
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,196
Are you sure it's our target Tora?

39
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,408
It's the target, no mistake.

40
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,454
Alright, the mission to capture
lost pet "Tora" is complete!

41
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,918
Isn't there a mission
with a greater sense of urgency?!

42
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,548
A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!

43
00:02:55,718 --> 00:03:02,016
Ohhh! My cute Tora!
I was worried to death!

44
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,605
The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo
Madame Shijimi and Tora.

45
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,693
Serves him right, that stupid cat!

46
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,946
No wonder he ran away...

47
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,573
...Now, then!

48
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,869
The next mission for
Kakashi's seventh squad is...

49
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:30,669
An errand to the neighboring town...
to baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy...

50
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,921
Helping with digging
for potatoes, eh...

51
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,297
Nooooo!

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,716
No! No, thank you!

53
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,842
As for me,

54
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,678
I want to do like
a more exciting mission!

55
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,013
Give us something else!

56
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,473
He's got a point...

57
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,642
Man... He's a pain!

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,356
I thought it was about time
for him to get fretful...

59
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,818
You fool!
You're still bottom rookie!

60
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,153
At the start,

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,780
everyone moves up
the ladder

62
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,323
by gaining experience
from simple missions!

63
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,950
B-But!

64
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,036
It's been nothing
but blah missions so far!

65
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,498
Knock it off!

66
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,874
Naruto!

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:14,630
It's necessary to explain to you
what a mission is...

68
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,715
Listen to me!

69
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,178
Requests pour into the village
every day.

70
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,515
They range from babysitting
to assassinations...

71
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:30,312
A wide spectrum of requests are
recorded on the request list...

72
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:36,151
They are separated into A, B, C,
and D ranks in order of difficulty.

73
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,821
In the village,
everyone below me

74
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:45,244
is divided up by ability in the order of
Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.

75
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,456
We at the highest level distribute
the requests as missions

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,460
to Ninjas who have abilities
that suit said mission.

77
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,255
And, if the mission is successful,

78
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:00,718
the fee comes in from the client.

79
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,306
Nevertheless, you guys
have just become Genin...

80
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,059
rank D is about
the best you can do...

81
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,686
Hm?!

82
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,439
Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone
broth noodles,

83
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,732
so today will be miso broth...

84
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,442
Listen!

85
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,318
I-I'm sorry.

86
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,698
Maaaan!
You always lecture me, old man!

87
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:29,121
But I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!

88
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,205
Humph!

89
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,379
Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later...

90
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:49,141
This kid who could only
express himself with pranks...

91
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,936
Okay, fine!
Huh...?!

92
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,773
If you insist...

93
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,859
I'll have you do a Rank C mission...

94
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,737
You'll be bodyguards for someone.

95
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,489
Really?!

96
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,949
Ah-ha!
Who? Who?

97
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,159
A feudal lord?!

98
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,911
Or, a princess?!

99
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,246
Don't get so hasty.

100
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll introduce you now!

101
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,002
Could you please come in...?

102
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,087
Huh...?!

103
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:30,224
What's this? It's just a bunch
of darned squirts!

104
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,896
Huh...?

105
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,821
Particularly you, the smallest one
with the idiot face.

106
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,116
Are you really a Ninja?

107
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,495
Who's the smallest one with
the idiot face he's talking about...?

108
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,579
What?!

109
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,584
I'll kill him!!

110
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,044
What good will it do to
kill the old man

111
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,088
you're supposed to be
guarding, you moron?!

112
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:09,847
I'm Tazuna,
veteran bridge builder.

113
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,560
You'll be risking life and limb
in guarding me to the max

114
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,563
until I return to my land and
complete my bridge!

115
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,207
All right!

116
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,209
We're off!!

117
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,795
What're you so excited about?!

118
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,758
You see, I've never left
the village before!

119
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,180
Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!

120
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,018
I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him.
There's no need to worry.

121
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,521
...okay with this squirt?!

122
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,608
Anyone but this old dude, man...

123
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,276
He's really the worst client!

124
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,236
I'll tell him a thing or two...

125
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,071
Hey, old man!

126
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't be mocking Ninjas
so much!

127
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,201
I'm awesome, you see!

128
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,954
I'm a super-elite Ninja who
will be called Hokage one day!

129
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,790
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

130
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,209
Remember it well!!

131
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,718
The Hokage's the super top-dog
Ninja in the village, right?

132
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,639
You sure as heck don't seem like
you could become the Hokage...

133
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,016
Aaah! Shut up!

134
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,312
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to become the Hokage!

135
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:45,067
You'll have no choice
but to acknowledge me then!!

136
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,404
I'll never acknowledge you, squirt...

137
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,657
Even if you become the Hokage!

138
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,368
What?! I'll kill you!

139
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,411
I told you to stop it, you moron!

140
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:01,208
No! At least let me have
one shot, just one...

141
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,091
Say...Mr.Tazuna...?

142
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,592
What is it?

143
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,346
Your country is
"The Land of the Waves," right?

144
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,390
What of it?

145
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,642
Say, Kakashi Sensei...

146
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,602
Are there Ninjas in that land, too?

147
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,356
No, there aren't Ninjas in
the Land of the Waves...

148
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,611
But in other nations, while cultures
and customs are different,

149
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,614
hidden villages exist,
and there are Ninjas there.

150
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,204
To the many nations on the continent,

151
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,958
the existence of Shinobi Villages is
a measure of the nation's military strength.

152
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,252
In other words,

153
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,131
that is how these nations maintain
their relationships with neighboring nations.

154
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,803
Even so, the villages are not
under the control of the nations.

155
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,889
They are equal in rank.

156
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,310
On a small island like
the Land of the Waves,

157
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,645
where it is difficult to be
influenced by other nations,

158
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,565
there is no need
for a Shinobi village.

159
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,446
Among the respective nations
that possess a Shinobi Village,

160
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:19,536
the five nations of "Fire," "Water,"
"Lightning," "Wind," and "Earth,"

161
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,372
due to their large territory and
immeasurable power,

162
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,541
are called the "Five Great Nations."

163
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,004
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,

164
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,466
the Village Hidden in the Mist
of the Land of Water,

165
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,302
the Village Hidden in the Clouds
of the Land of Lightning,

166
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,554
the Village Hidden in the Sand
of the Land of Wind,

167
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,640
the Village Hidden in the Rocks
of the Land of Earth.

168
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,894
Only the leaders of
each of these Hidden Villages

169
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,396
are allowed to have
the name of Kage, the Shadow.

170
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,524
The "Hokage"

171
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,776
"Mizukage"
(Water Shadow),

172
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,902
"Raikage"
(Lightning Shadow),

173
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,070
"Kazekage"
(Wind Shadow),

174
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,321
"Tsuchikage"
(Earth Shadow),

175
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,656
the so-called
Five Kage (shadows),

176
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,035
reign supreme over
the tens of thousands of Ninjas

177
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,620
in each nation
of the whole world.

178
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,332
No kidding...
Lord Hokage is that incredible!

179
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,461
I wonder if that blah old man
is really that incredible...

180
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,588
Sounds fishy!

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,761
That can't be true! No way!

182
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,554
Hey!

183
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,559
You guys just doubted
Lord Hokage now, didn't you...?

184
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,400
Well...don't worry.

185
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:36,071
There are no Ninja battles
in Rank C missions.

186
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:40,492
Then, there's no worry of getting
into a scrape with foreign Ninjas...!

187
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,077
Of course, not.

188
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,714
What?!

189
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,674
Huh?!
W-What?

190
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,092
The first one!

191
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,606
K-Kakashi Sensei!

192
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,443
The second one...

193
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,529
The second one...

194
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,538
Ohhh...!

195
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,797
Hm?!

196
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,595
It doesn't come off!

197
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,854
W...Wow!!

198
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,031
They'll come!

199
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,700
I have to do it...
I have to!!

200
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,035
Get back, sir!!

201
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,312
Yo...

202
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,774
Kakashi Sensei...! He's alive!

203
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,235
Humph!
Show off...

204
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,906
Whaa...?! Then, what was that...?

205
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,204
So Kakashi Sensei...used Substitutions...

206
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,877
Naruto...
Sorry I didn't help you right away...

207
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,921
I got you hurt.

208
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,176
I didn't think you'd be
incapable of moving...

209
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,639
I was saved, somehow...

210
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,812
Anyhow, let me just say,
good job, Sasuke.

211
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,980
You, too, Sakura.

212
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,569
I...couldn't do anything...

213
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,821
but Sasuke...

214
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,240
It was his first real battle...

215
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,868
Didn't he feel scared, at all?

216
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:15,665
He saved me like it was nothing and
without getting any dirt on his clothes...

217
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,044
Hey...
Huh?!

218
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,171
Are you hurt...

219
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,007
scaredy cat...?

220
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,471
Sasuke!
Naruto!

221
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,642
These guys have poison
on their claws.

222
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,853
You need to
take out the poison quickly.

223
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
What?!

224
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,442
You have to open the wound and
drain the poisoned blood.

225
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,818
Don't move so much.

226
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,445
The poison will spread.

227
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,656
By the way, Mr. Tazuna...

228
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,908
W-What is it...?!

229
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,370
I have something
to talk to you about.

230
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,708
Chunin from the
Village Hidden in the Mist...

231
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,379
These guys are Ninjas known for
continuing to fight

232
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,798
no matter what the sacrifice.

233
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,510
How were you able
to detect our movements?

234
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,138
There probably wouldn't be
puddles of water

235
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,518
on a clear day like today,
when it hasn't rained for days.

236
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,980
Knowing that, why'd you leave it
to the kids to fight?

237
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,944
If I felt like it,
I could kill these guys instantly...

238
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,990
But...
I had to know...

239
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,662
who the target
of these enemies was...

240
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,373
Hm?! What do you mean?

241
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,542
In other words...

242
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,294
what I mean is I had to know
if it was you,

243
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:49,634
or one of us Shinobi...
who was being targeted.

244
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:55,515
We haven't heard anything about
you being targeted by Ninjas.

245
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,144
The content of the request was
supposed to just be

246
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,981
protection from gangs,
thieves, and the like...

247
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,317
This is a mission with
a B rank or higher.

248
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,987
The request was supposed to be

249
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,532
for backup protection
until you finished building your bridge...

250
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,286
If our enemies were to be Ninjas,

251
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,912
the mission would've been
estimated without question

252
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,331
as an expensive
"B Rank" mission.

253
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,085
It appears there's some kind
of good reason for this,

254
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,963
but being lied to in the request
won't do.

255
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,092
This is beyond the scope
of our mission.

256
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,138
This mission is too soon for us...

257
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,806
Let's give it up!

258
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,684
We need an anesthetic to
open Naruto's wound

259
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,520
and get out the poisoned blood...

260
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,398
We have to return to the village
and take him to a doctor...

261
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,233
Hmmm...

262
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,737
Hm? What...?!

263
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,784
This sure is a burden!

264
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,162
Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,
shall we go back to the village...?

265
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,339
Huh!
Oh!

266
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,307
Why am I so different?!

267
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,269
Why's it always me...
Darn it!

268
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,231
Naruto! What're you doing?!

269
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,693
I should be getting stronger...

270
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,987
Here I'm steadily carrying
out missions and

271
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,366
doing special-skill training
by myself every day...

272
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,123
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued.

273
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,753
I'll never be afraid
or a be a coward...

274
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,173
I won't lose to Sasuke...

275
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,554
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!

276
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:03,017
I'll protect you, old man...
with this Kunai knife!!

277
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,985
The mission continues!!

278
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,611
Naruto...

279
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,406
It's all well and good to
rid yourself of the poisoned blood,

280
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,450
but any more than that and
you'll bleed to death.

281
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,337
Things will get hairy if you don't
stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!

282
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,383
No! No!

283
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,802
I can't die like this, I say!

284
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,429
Show me your hand.

285
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,931
Nooo! Help me!!

286
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,308
Naruto!

287
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,311
You're really self-abusive,
aren't you!

288
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,855
That's masochistic!

289
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,279
The wound is...

290
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,323
already starting to heal...

291
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,120
Um...um...

292
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:09,417
Am I okay?
You look awfully serious...

293
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,129
Well...You should be okay.

294
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,467
Is it...the power of
the Nine-Tailed Fox...?

295
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,561
Did you say you failed?!

296
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,398
I paid a lot of money to hire
you guys

297
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,026
because you said
you were once hot-shot Ninjas!

298
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,487
Stop your darned grumbling...!!

299
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:49,123
Next time, I'll kill him with this...
head chopper!

300
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,461
I-It's really okay, right?!

301
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,590
It seems that the enemy
has hired good Ninjas...

302
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:02,345
On top of that, a tightened guard
on account of the Demon Brothers' failure

303
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,263
means that it won't be easy...

304
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,100
Just who do you think I am?!

305
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,482
This Zabuza Momochi,
who is called the demon of...

306
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,610
the Hidden Mist!!

307
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,249
We've finally landed ashore
in the Land of the Waves.

308
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,626
The guys before were
all well and good,

309
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,378
but there should be even
stronger guys lying in wait.

310
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,215
Okay! I'm going to regain
my honor and continue the mission.

311
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,841
No matter what enemy comes,

312
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,260
I'll protect the old man
this time around for sure.

313
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,638
Oh, they wasted no time.

314
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,390
An impressive-looking guy with
a huge Katana has come.

315
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,018
Next episode:
"The Assassin of the Mist!"

316
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,646
I'm going to kick butt once again!
