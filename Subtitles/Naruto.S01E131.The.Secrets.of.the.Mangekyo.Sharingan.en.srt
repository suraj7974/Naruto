1
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,475
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,485
The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan

21
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,681
No matter what darkness might lie ahead,

22
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,307
I will rush into it headfirst!

23
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,769
No matter what happens,

24
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,313
I will get my hands on that power!

25
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,741
It's getting late...

26
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,645
What was that?

27
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,023
I thought I sensed someone there just now...

28
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,904
The lights...

29
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,323
It isn't even close to bedtime yet...

30
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,787
This is...!

31
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,294
Wh-What is this...?!

32
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,132
What the hell is this?!

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,263
Uncle... Aunt...

34
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,020
Father... Mother...

35
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,197
Father? Mother?

36
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,354
There's somebody in there!

37
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,947
Move!

38
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,616
Move!

39
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,868
Move!

40
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,500
Father! Mother!

41
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,278
Big Brother!

42
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,239
Big Brother! Father and Mother are...!

43
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,200
Why? For what reason?!

44
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,703
Who the hell would do
something like this...?!

45
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,626
Big Brother...what are...?

46
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,180
What are you doing, Big Brother?!

47
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,725
You pathetic younger brother...

48
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,984
Mangekyo Sharingan!

49
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,289
Stop! Big Brother!

50
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,291
Don't make me see this kind of thing!

51
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,628
Why...?!

52
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,255
Big Brother, why did you...?!

53
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,827
Why...

54
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,082
Big Brother... Why did you...?

55
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,672
In order to measure my vessel...

56
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,342
To measure your vessel?

57
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,554
Is that all?

58
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,478
Only for that reason...
you killed everybody...?

59
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,733
That is what is important.

60
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,696
What the hell is that?

61
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,243
You gotta be kidding!

62
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,183
I'm scared...

63
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,685
I'm scared!

64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,953
Don't kill me...!

65
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,273
I don't believe it!

66
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,859
This is too unlike you, Big Brother.
I mean...

67
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,322
The reason I acted as the big brother
you desired was...

68
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,075
because I wanted to measure your vessel.

69
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,789
You have the potential
to become my opponent

70
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,960
in order for me to measure my vessel.

71
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,507
You hated me...

72
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,594
and you continued to have
the desire to surpass me.

73
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,472
That's exactly why
I will allow you to live...

74
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,975
for my own benefit.

75
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,814
You are someone who could be able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.

76
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,944
However, on one condition...

77
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,412
That you must kill your closest friend...

78
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,874
Y-You've gotta be kidding...

79
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,799
Just like I did...

80
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:57,097
Regarding Shisui Uchiha
who committed suicide last night

81
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,765
by throwing himself into the Nakano River...

82
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,604
The other one that did not show up
to the meeting is Shisui...

83
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,399
If I remember correctly...

84
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,234
you adored him like
he was your real older brother...

85
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,239
That was...your doing...?

86
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,201
Big Brother, you...killed Shisui?!

87
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:22,497
That's right...and because of
that I obtained these eyes.

88
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,586
The main hall of Nakano Shrine...

89
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,256
Underneath the seventh tatami mat
on the far right

90
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,550
is the secret gathering place of the Clan.

91
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,348
There you will find recorded
the secret of...

92
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:45,604
the raison d'être of
the Uchiha Clan's Visual Jutsu.

93
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,067
The secret of the raison d'être...?

94
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,737
If you attain these eyes,

95
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,323
you will become the third person
including myself

96
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,743
to utilize the Mangekyo Sharingan.

97
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,329
If that happens...

98
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,208
then there will have been meaning
in my allowing you to live.

99
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,919
However...at present...

100
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,632
You are not worth killing.

101
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,593
My pathetic younger brother...

102
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,722
If you want to kill me, then begrudge me!
Hate me!

103
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,935
And live in an ugly manner...

104
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,231
Run away...run away... and cling to life...

105
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,693
And one day, when you have
the same eyes as I do...

106
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,862
come and stand before me!

107
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,801
A dream...?

108
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,902
Yes...that's right.

109
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,655
The only one who survived... is that boy.

110
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,867
Didn't he have an older brother?

111
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,289
Yes, but he's gone missing...

112
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,587
It can't be true... That elite Uchiha Clan...

113
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,077
Hi, Sasuke!
What did you come to buy today?

114
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,283
Sasuke, are you on your way to school?

115
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,409
Yeah.

116
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,166
I saw Itachi earlier,
but he's very admirable, isn't he?

117
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,377
He's already become a top-class Shinobi.

118
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,256
He graduated from the Ninja Academy
at the top of his class at age seven

119
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,801
and attained the rank
of Chunin at age ten, didn't he?

120
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,679
He was able to use Sharingan
when he was eight!

121
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,349
That's true, isn't it?

122
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:13,603
That boy is truly the pride
of the Uchiha Clan.

123
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,894
Welcome home...Sasuke!

124
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,593
Sasuke...!

125
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,511
Wait a second...

126
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,513
What is it?

127
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,150
Mother?!

128
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,748
Then why only Big Brother!

129
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,713
Your brother's your brother.
And you are you.

130
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,716
Father cares deeply about both of you.

131
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,144
The main hall of Nakano Shrine...

132
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,441
Located underneath
the seventh tatami mat on the far right

133
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,235
is our clan's secret gathering place...

134
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,579
I see... So that's what it is...

135
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,209
Ninja Academy

136
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,336
Hey, Shikamaru...

137
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,464
Wanna go to the candy shop after school?

138
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,424
Huh... No way.

139
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,469
You can do that 'cuz your mother's nice,

140
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,222
but if my mother found out that I bought
myself a snack before going home,

141
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,433
I'd be in big trouble.

142
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,727
Did you hear the news...

143
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,897
that entire Uchiha Clan
was apparently murdered?

144
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,399
Yeah, my dad told me.

145
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,862
Apparently he's the only one who survived...

146
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,755
That's my boy.

147
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,010
With me, you're all
your father talks about...

148
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:25,980
I wonder...what kind of things
Father was saying to Mother...

149
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,284
If you want to kill me...

150
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,287
Begrudge me! Hate me!

151
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,672
If it's for the purpose of killing you,

152
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:55,385
I will rush headfirst into whatever
darkness which may lie ahead!

153
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,389
I will obtain that power no matter what!

154
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,684
From this point onwards, I am an avenger!

155
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,148
Sasuke is now in depths of darkness...

156
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,317
If you stop in a place like this...

157
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,112
you won't be able to catch up with Sasuke.

158
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,428
Neji, it's just like you said.

159
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,264
That guy looks like he's in
the depths of darkness right now...

160
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,436
He really hit me with
his full strength! Damn it!

161
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:57,614
Don't you consider me...
your comrade any longer?!

162
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:04,579
Don't all those things we did together
in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!

163
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:07,999
No.

164
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:13,546
I will get my hands on
that power no matter what.

165
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,799
It wasn't meaningless...

166
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:23,473
To me, you became my... closest friend.

167
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,268
We've become...friends?

168
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,438
-Then...why?!
-All the more reason why...

169
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,442
All the more reason why...

170
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,320
there's meaning in taking you down.

171
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,245
I don't fully understand but...

172
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,791
I understood that you want to
fight me with your everything!

173
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,626
Sasuke...!

174
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,400
When I recalled the parts one by one,

175
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,823
I felt as though
I had understood everything

176
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,411
Faded words

177
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:32,583
which I kept so close to me

178
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:38,172
Speechless nights,

179
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,385
a hint of warmth,

180
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,891
and this distant yearning for you

181
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,020
I live,

182
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:58,234
simply repeating this cycle

183
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:07,076
Held in my two hands

184
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,204
A droplet of time

185
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,754
Softly clutching forgotten memories

186
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

187
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,685
I'll keep these thoughts...

188
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,819
Are you trying to take me down for real?

189
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,739
I don't know any longer

190
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,866
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not!

191
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,412
Could it be that it was only I
who thought we were friends?

192
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:57,502
If that's the case,
I'm just a really lame guy...

193
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,670
Aren't I? Sasuke?

194
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,964
