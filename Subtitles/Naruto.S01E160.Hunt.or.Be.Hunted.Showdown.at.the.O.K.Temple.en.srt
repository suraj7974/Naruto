1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,207
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,686
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,289
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,010
Hmm, what?

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,681
A wanted flyer.

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,061
"This man who calls himself
Tokichi is a major criminal

18
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,648
who has killed a family of three..."

19
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,609
"He has a bird-shaped birthmark
on his chest."

20
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,321
A bird-shaped birthmark...?
It couldn't be...

21
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,740
What is it, Hinata?

22
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:57,535
I can't tell because
his face is covered with scars.

23
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,330
But he has...a bird-shaped birthmark.

24
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,253
He has a bounty on his head too?

25
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,840
What the heck is going on
with everything?

26
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,558
Hunt or Be Hunted?!
Showdown at the OK Temple

27
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,523
Where are you going, old man?

28
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,197
Just rest quietly.

29
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,200
Let go!

30
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,038
Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine...

31
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,792
What the heck can you do in that condition,
you wanted man?!

32
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,010
A bounty hunter who was
in the bar attacked last night...

33
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,098
What's the idea of a bounty
chasing after a bounty?

34
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,559
It's none of your concern!

35
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,231
Your wound again...

36
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,152
Stop!

37
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,905
D-Don't move!

38
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,077
I didn't do it...

39
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,414
Then, how do you explain
this wanted flyer?

40
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,418
That Gosunkugi did it...

41
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,673
He killed an innocent family
of three...

42
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,509
just to steal money.

43
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,221
What do you mean by that?

44
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,897
I was a swordsmith in a tiny village...

45
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:36,485
in a small country sandwiched
between two large countries.

46
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,836
I was poor,
but for me it was a happy life.

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,631
But on that festival day...

48
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:24,867
I was about to go deliver a sword
that a customer had ordered.

49
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,372
I wanted to participate in the festival
right away, so I was hurrying.

50
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,207
At that very moment...

51
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,176
For some reason,
the door was half open.

52
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,598
It's Tokichi...
I'm delivering the sword you ordered...

53
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,710
I told everyone everything
as it happened.

54
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:04,466
But...the people in the village
wouldn't believe me.

55
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,721
It's because I was the only one
who hadn't shown up at the festival.

56
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,685
And the particular shape of the sword
that stabbed through the family...

57
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,605
A swordsmith should be able
to make any kind of weapon...

58
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,399
That was the reason.

59
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,235
Stand up, Tokichi!

60
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,654
Tokichi!

61
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,114
Don't let him get away! After him!

62
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,411
And ever since...

63
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:37,249
I wandered aimlessly from town to town.

64
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,921
BOUNTY
One million ryo

65
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,176
It was something
the villagers had issued.

66
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,388
And there was one more
wanted flyer besides mine...

67
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,683
BOUNTY
Threee million yen

68
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,977
...of the man who killed the family.

69
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,614
I resolved to capture Gosunkugi
with my own hands.

70
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,412
I would clear my name and
return to my village...

71
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,886
And...to get some information about him,
if even just a little...

72
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:38,810
I became a bounty hunter despite
having a price on my own head.

73
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,453
So that's why we were in the way, huh?

74
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,874
The only way to prove my innocence
is for me to capture him myself.

75
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,419
I want to go home.

76
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,385
Will you...concede him to me?

77
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,433
We're Ninja.

78
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,560
We carry out missions we've received,
no matter what!

79
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,356
Even if the worst were to happen,
we can't let him get away.

80
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,193
Let's go...

81
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,296
Was that okay, Naruto?

82
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,966
That Gosunkugi jerk!

83
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,468
We have to capture him,
no matter what.

84
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,470
That's right.

85
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:02,436
And if that old man, Sazanami,
pushes it too far in his condition,

86
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,606
not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi,
he could end up getting killed instead.

87
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,918
Don't hold back.
I'll give you...

88
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,172
the likes of my head.

89
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,886
You're wounded,
so I can kill you whenever I want.

90
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,848
Before that, I'll be taking Gosunkugi.

91
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,312
Well, I guess I'll just have
those Shinobi kids do their best.

92
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,658
The Land of Stone,
Post Station Two...

93
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,370
It seems everything in this town...

94
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,333
politics, economics, military,
is conducted by monks.

95
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,795
It really is. Nothing but temples...

96
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,549
The temple, which could be
called the head temple,

97
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,802
is the OK Temple on that mountain.

98
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,262
Hey, Hinata. What's that bell?

99
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,807
☺That was created as
the sightseeing crown jewel

100
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,228
to recruit people to live in their temple...
The Golden Bell!

101
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,690
It's just like it is saying,
"Please steal me."

102
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,695
I know...
Gosunkugi is after that bell!

103
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,156
– Yeah.
– Yeah.

104
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,858
But how does that Gosunkugi guy
intend to steal that bell?

105
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,832
Naruto!
Huh...?

106
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,805
You guys...are Gosunkugi's...!

107
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,766
Are these guys going to corral us?!

108
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,269
Just like the time with Sazanami...

109
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
Byakugan.

110
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,818
Look out! Run!

111
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,740
Old Man Sazanami?!

112
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,242
Leave this to me!

113
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,161
All right!

114
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,121
Eat this!

115
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,425
What're you doing here...?

116
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,136
I just came to settle the score.

117
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,597
But...your wound is still...

118
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,683
I won't get in your way.

119
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,562
I'll pursue the target on my own.
This is a competition!

120
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,024
I guess it can't be helped.
I accept!

121
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,486
But we can't even start
as things stand now!

122
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,073
There are still nails in the ground...

123
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,450
He's waiting for the best moment.

124
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,619
Gosunkugi!

125
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,626
The bell...is at the top!

126
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
What...?! Could it be...?!

127
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh, no...!

128
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,927
The nails in the ground aren't moving.

129
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,054
The Jutsu has worn off!
What?!

130
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,265
Damn it! When did he...?!

131
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,726
So as the words say,
we've been "nailed down," huh?

132
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,778
They're by the bell!

133
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,988
Why that...!

134
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:28,868
Wait! Don't forget the bounty hunter
from last night is also after Gosunkugi!

135
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:34,541
No problem...! We'll get there first,
no matter what!

136
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,084
Let's go!

137
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,980
How awful...
That Gosunkugi jerk...!

138
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,064
Unforgivable!

139
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,486
Hey! Where's Gosunkugi?!

140
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,156
Naruto! He'll get away if we're too slow!

141
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,161
We don't have any time to think.
Let's take care of this in one shot!

142
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,623
Gentle Fist!

143
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,169
Akamaru!

144
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,672
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry...

145
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,135
Man-Beast Clone!

146
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,054
Fang Over Fang!

147
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,557
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

148
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,729
U-zu-ma-ki

149
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,439
Naruto Barrage!

150
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,067
Here I go...

151
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,238
I hit you with the back of the sword...

152
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,541
Where's Gosunkugi?

153
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,629
That way!

154
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,975
Gosunkugi!

155
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,852
He's ours!

156
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,362
Old man, you're going to prove
your innocence, right?!

157
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,156
If you're a bounty hunter,
then show your pride!

158
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,748
Ninja Art: Flying Nail Mist!

159
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,336
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

160
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,509
Eat this!

161
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,139
Too slow!

162
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,570
Farewell!

163
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,824
Damn it...!

164
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,704
It's not over yet!

165
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,955
What?!

166
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,165
Prepare yourself!

167
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,169
W-Wait!

168
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,628
Don't be hasty...

169
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,601
If I kill you, the one who can prove
my innocence will be gone!

170
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,271
We lose...

171
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,647
That's right...

172
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
What?!

173
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,530
Bounty Sazanami,
otherwise known as Tokichi...

174
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,742
I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!

175
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,954
And you, bounty Gosunkugi!

176
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,748
Your spree of evil deeds...

177
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,709
The number of charges
against you is incalculable...

178
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,296
A government official has ordered
you hauled in for questioning!

179
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,383
Old man...

180
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,846
Damn it. There's nothing we can do
if the opposition is a bureaucrat...

181
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,815
You murderer!

182
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,608
Give back the family you killed!

183
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,194
We'll kill you in the same way!

184
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,618
Damn it...!

185
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,419
Hey, hey, you guys!

186
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,881
You've got nerve to put up wanted flyers
without doing a decent investigation!

187
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,981
This man is the true culprit behind
the murder that occurred in this village!

188
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,614
This Gosunkugi has already been
apprehended and has confessed.

189
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,409
And the weapon has been seized...

190
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,829
Therefore this individual Tokichi
shall be acquitted!

191
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:28,084
You jerks!
You made me work for free!

192
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,335
What're you going to do about it?!

193
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,843
Why'd you do that for me?

194
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,056
I overheard some stupid tale
of woe, you see.

195
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,602
It makes no difference
to a bounty hunter...

196
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,521
But I overheard it,
and so I had no choice.

197
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:54,527
It was necessary to verify whether
or not you really are a wanted man...

198
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,279
You...

199
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,948
Not "you." Gatsu!

200
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,328
I'm also a bounty hunter...
I'm in the same trade as you!

201
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,291
Gatsu...

202
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,543
Tokichi... We're sorry.

203
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,462
Forgive us, Tokichi.

204
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,466
Good for you... Old Man Sazanami.

205
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,884
Let's go.

206
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,521
I've kind of gotten homesick

207
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,524
and really miss the Leaf Village...

208
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,071
But you know, a failed mission
means failure...

209
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,907
The Fifth Hokage's going
to scold you good, Naruto.

210
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,036
What?!

211
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,497
You failed another mission?!

212
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,960
I...don't want to go home...

213
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:22,782
So many things happen

214
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:28,496
on this endless road, huh?

215
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:34,127
Although you're strong-willed,

216
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

217
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,429
What dreams

218
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:51,310
did you chase to get here?

219
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:58,192
Even I have times when

220
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

221
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,745
When you're sad,

222
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:14,709
I'll be close to you

223
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:20,590
Even on nights when we're apart,

224
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

225
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:32,769
I'll be close to you

226
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,943
Creeping up noisily,
a round, fat guy and a skinny one!

227
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,781
Beneath the scorching rain,
a disastrous tranquility ensues.

228
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,574
Tsunade hits the jackpot!

229
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,159
Kakashi's guess is a huge bust!

230
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,328
Heard it somewhere,
this unprecented event!

231
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,288
The great acts of
Monday and Pocha!

232
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,165
Then comes Naruto...

233
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,959
Let me join in
the training too!

234
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:01,589
Next time:
"The Appearance of Strange Visitors"
