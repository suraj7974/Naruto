1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,424
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:34,887
A Town of Outlaws!
The Shadow of the Fuma Clan

22
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:39,141
It seems that the most bustling traveler's
town in the Land of Rice Paddies

23
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,810
is at the bottom of these mountains.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,395
You're going to weird places again

25
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,481
in the name of investigation,
aren't you, Pervy Sage?!

26
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,025
Please stop it already!

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,530
We had a rough time shaking
off the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.

28
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,700
I understand your point,

29
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,831
but there's no other way to find
Village Hidden in the Sound.

30
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,959
Gee, I don't like it either, but...

31
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,962
This is truly a problem...

32
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:12,049
But we have to do things
we don't like... Right?!

33
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,677
Okay, let's go!

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,721
Naruto, Sakura,
don't drag your feet!

35
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,184
Investigation, investigation!
What a pain.

36
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,103
He looks like he's having fun.

37
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,689
He hasn't learned at all.

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,946
Fuma Alley

39
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,117
– Oww!
– That's my line!

40
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,749
This is even rougher than
the traveler's town before.

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,297
Let's just take a pass on this place
and find Village Hidden in the Sound.

42
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,395
Say...
I don't have any more money.

43
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,647
I don't have any more money either!

44
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,399
Here!

45
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,193
You guys go get some food with that

46
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,154
and wait in the temple
on the outskirts of town.

47
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:23,245
Information accumulates
in this kind of place,

48
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,956
but it's not good for you guys to see.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,251
I'll sacrifice myself and check it out.

50
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,839
He's a surprisingly nice person...

51
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,345
Sakura... You're still so naïve.

52
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,389
Where should I investigate first?

53
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:47,144
Gee, how rough...
Investigations are painful.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,359
Let's leave the Pervy Sage be
and check somewhere else.

55
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,322
What's the matter, Sakura?

56
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,371
I don't think...
Sasuke's in this land anymore.

57
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,539
What's the matter?!

58
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,668
We won't know that if
we don't investigate!

59
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,919
Yeah, but...

60
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,631
Our opponent is Orochimaru.

61
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,800
Of course, things might not go easily.

62
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,345
But you know...

63
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,474
But I'm sure we'll find him!

64
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,811
Right.

65
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,940
Naruto!

66
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,654
You're...the one from before?!

67
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,867
This kid's...hurt...

68
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,494
You...?

69
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,997
Naruto!

70
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,649
Substitution, huh...?

71
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,318
We let them get away.

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,990
Don't worry...

73
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:28,078
My cute children
are making a silver trail for us.

74
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,206
They can't escape from us now...

75
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,547
It seems those two are
petty Ninja from somewhere.

76
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,842
But getting involved with us
has sealed their fate.

77
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,552
It's unfortunate for them...

78
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,557
The objective of those who sneak into
this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.

79
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,415
Sure enough, the skin of
a young woman is supple.

80
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,752
You're mean!
Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.

81
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:22,257
By the way, have you guys heard
rumors about the Sound Village?

82
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,842
The Sound Village?

83
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,012
I've never heard the name
of such a village.

84
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,932
I'll tip you handsomely if you tell me.

85
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,561
But I really don't know.

86
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,480
I've never heard of it.

87
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,816
I've heard of it!

88
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:44,071
One of my regulars knows
a lot about it.

89
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:45,823
Wanna come?

90
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,491
Yeah.

91
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,161
His home is in the back of this alley.

92
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,808
Trapped like a rat.

93
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:18,147
What, it's a seedy old man!
Hey! He's got money, right?

94
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,983
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.

95
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:26,405
You punks! Stop the idle chatter
and take care of him now!

96
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,574
Right, boss!

97
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,002
Getting infatuated with girls has sealed
your fate! Rest in peace!

98
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,769
Ninja Art:
Needle Jizo.

99
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,398
You punk...

100
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm in a hurry...

101
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,156
I think it'd be best if you
answer compliantly

102
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,870
whether or not you know
about Hidden Sound Village.

103
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,875
You're a fool if I look like
a compliant person to you!

104
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,294
You a Ninja?

105
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,796
If so?

106
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,924
Interesting!

107
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,510
We've reduced ourselves to
being thieves,

108
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,097
but we're a somewhat
famous Shinobi clan around here!

109
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,435
Instead of taking your life,
I could hire you if you want!

110
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,812
A Ninja, huh...

111
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,776
Then I don't need to go easy on you.

112
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,738
Don't be acting like a big shot, old man!

113
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,407
Shut up, you squirt!

114
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,995
A Ninja refers to one who endures.

115
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,789
Those who couldn't endure
their hunger pangs

116
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,459
and resort to use their diligently
studied Jutsu for stealing

117
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,670
are not called Ninja!

118
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,130
I won't let that pass!

119
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,217
Thinking we're fellow Shinobi,
we took pity on you.

120
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,010
Acting all conceited!

121
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,931
Regret after being sliced in two!

122
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,105
Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!

123
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,321
Rasengan!

124
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,962
You punk! How dare you
do that to the boss!

125
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,797
We won't let you do
any more than that!

126
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,092
Oh?
Hold it, you guys!

127
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,815
I didn't know you were so good!

128
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,483
That Jutsu just now...

129
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,820
I sense you must be
a person of stature!

130
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,241
If it's all right,
may I ask you your name?

131
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,872
If you don't know, then I shall tell you!

132
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,378
Women become infatuated
with his sex appeal.

133
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,964
He's strong against Shinobi,
but has a soft spot for women!

134
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,008
He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves...

135
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,970
And made his name known...

136
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:50,609
Master Jiraiya, that's me!

137
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,653
What?!

138
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,282
You guys bow your heads
and beg for your lives!

139
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,160
We'll all be killed!

140
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,538
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

141
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,835
Although we didn't know,
being so rude to Master Jiraiya,

142
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,172
reputed as one of the Legendary
Sannin of the Leaf Village!

143
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,926
We beg for your forgiveness!

144
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,680
So my name's known in this land, too...

145
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,307
Well, it's okay.

146
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,646
So is it true that you know about
Village Hidden in the Sound?

147
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,150
Yes! There were many Ninja clans
in the Land of Rice Paddies,

148
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,486
including us Fuma.

149
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,322
We divided up the roles
amongst ourselves

150
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,493
and the Ninja of this land
were doing well in their own way.

151
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,704
Until that man appeared...

152
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,125
Who was that man?

153
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,628
It's regrettable to even speak
of that name...

154
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,008
It was Orochimaru!

155
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,483
It's okay! Rest easy!

156
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,862
If germs get into the wound
and you get tetanus,

157
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,029
you won't be saved.

158
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,992
But fortunately, I have medicine,
so let me treat you.

159
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,203
They're not coming.

160
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,373
Just show us your wound.

161
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,754
Well, huh?

162
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,178
Naruto, go wait outside
till my treatment is done.

163
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,721
Huh?

164
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,855
Why do I have to be
the only one chased out?!

165
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,734
Jeez!

166
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,986
I guess it can't be helped.

167
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,161
Don't peek!

168
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,421
I know.

169
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,298
Okay, show me your wound.

170
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,282
How mean...
To hit me out of the blue...?

171
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,330
Whoa, interesting.

172
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,500
Naruto! You can come in!

173
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,627
What?!

174
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,425
A cute girl?

175
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,266
Sakura! This girl!
Who the heck is this girl?!

176
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,102
How dense. It's the Ninja
from a moment ago.

177
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,194
Come to think of it...

178
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,532
Why...?

179
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,373
I am Sasame Fuma.

180
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:45,135
Sasame... Why were you being
chased by those guys?

181
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,178
If you like, try talking about it.

182
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,681
We might be able to help.

183
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,026
They were the Sound Ninja protecting
Orochimaru's residence.

184
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,319
What?!

185
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,448
I'm sorry for mistaking you guys as
one of them the other day.

186
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,200
That doesn't matter!

187
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,162
We're also looking for Orochimaru!

188
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,914
Would you please give us the details?

189
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,125
Okay...

190
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,797
It all started with the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Rice Paddies

191
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,424
launching an attack on
a neighboring land

192
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,092
in an attempt to expand the territory.

193
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,221
The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land...

194
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,099
And there aren't that many Shinobi.

195
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,647
It was a foolhardy attack.
Losing was expected...

196
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,359
And the Shinobi clans of this land

197
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,780
who participated in
the losing battle went to ruin...

198
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,742
We the Fuma Clan as well.

199
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,579
I hear that among
the surviving Shinobi,

200
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:55,872
there are those who have left the land

201
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,084
and those who have
stooped to become thieves.

202
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,295
Even so, we've lived believing
in a restoration of the clan

203
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,631
and continued to live hiding
in the shadows.

204
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,470
At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden
in the Sound appeared before us

205
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,600
attempting to create the first full-scale
Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.

206
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,814
The emissary of
the Sound Village said...

207
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:27,028
My master Orochimaru is
gathering all sorts of Jutsu!

208
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,572
He has taken an interest
in your Jutsu well.

209
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,242
Depending on your work,

210
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,536
you might be given the chance
to serve the Feudal Lord!

211
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,498
My cousin Arashi...

212
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,085
was an up-and-coming star
for the restoration of the clan...

213
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,256
Arashi as a representative of the clan

214
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,092
headed for Village Hidden in
the Sound together with the emissary.

215
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
But...

216
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,099
And then...?

217
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,771
We waited for a notice from Arashi, but...

218
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,774
There is no word from him, huh?

219
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,657
Damn it!
He was tricked by that Orochimaru!

220
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,159
Naruto!

221
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,954
Oh...!

222
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:23,209
Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi
might be safe...

223
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,754
We don't know, right?
And so...and so...

224
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,838
Idiot...!

225
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,507
I'm going to save Arashi!

226
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,929
I have a small body and
my power is weak.

227
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,306
So no matter what I did...

228
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,516
I did nothing but become a hindrance
even in Ninjutsu training...

229
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,438
But Arashi always saved me!

230
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,442
Everyone in the village has
already given up, but...

231
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,653
So I'll find Village Hidden
in the Sound alone...

232
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,365
And so you were chased by
the Sound Ninja, right?

233
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,620
This time, it's my turn to save Arashi!

234
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,456
Sasame!

235
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,045
I...I want to be of help to Arashi!

236
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,506
Naruto!

237
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,759
Yeah...I know!

238
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,972
We have to go to Village of the Sound
to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!

239
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,391
Now instead of one,

240
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,185
it's just that there are two guys
for us to bring back.

241
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,819
I'll save your cousin, Sasame!

242
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,030
Right!

243
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,451
Eew! A spider...

244
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,499
What's this?!

245
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,465
Naruto!
Wha...! What's this?!

246
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,221
Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!

247
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:04,602
My cute children made a path
for me out of silver thread

248
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,730
and told me where you guys
were going.

249
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:17,198
67All three of you together will descend
into hell while bearing the secret!

250
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,831
Naruto! It's the Ventriloquism Jutsu!

251
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,708
He's scattering his voice
to multiple directions

252
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,501
and covering up location and number!

253
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,504
I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!

254
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,385
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

255
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,608
Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!

256
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,695
It's a large number,
but it's just Clone Jutsu.

257
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,280
No. Look closely, Jigumo!

258
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,325
The threads are getting tangled.

259
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,455
All of the clones are tangible?!
Shadow clones?!

260
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,458
If so... Kagero!

261
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,585
Understood...

262
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,880
Come out!

263
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,971
Borne to be born, lived to live,
one sunrise and one sunset...

264
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,682
The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.

265
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:29,896
Thinking that such a fleeting life
is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable...

266
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,731
Know that I'm at my best

267
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,944
when living in the dark and
deep in the ground!

268
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,157
Ninja Art:

269
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,201
Ant Lion Jutsu!

270
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,733
When I recalled the parts one by one,

271
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:21,948
I felt as though
I had understood everything

272
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

273
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:33,126
which I kept so close to me

274
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,423
Speechless nights,

275
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,385
a hint of warmth,

276
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:49,392
and this distant yearning for you

277
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,145
I live,

278
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:58,526
simply repeating this cycle

279
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:07,118
Held in my two hands

280
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,329
A droplet of time

281
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,837
Softly clutching forgotten memories

282
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

283
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,352
I'll keep these thoughts...

284
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,027
Darn it! What a pesky bunch!

285
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,823
But I won't be done in so easily!

286
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,326
I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk's butt

287
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,245
and bring back Sasuke and
Sasame's cousin!

288
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,708
It doesn't matter if you guys
are powerhouses!

289
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,921
I'll kick all of your butts,
so bring it on from anywhere!

290
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:03,216
Next episode, "Pure Betrayal,
and a Fleeting Plea!"
