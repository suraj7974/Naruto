1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,559
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,435
Funeral March for the Living

21
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,148
Wh-Why...

22
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:51,612
Why does such a good man have to...die?!

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,574
It's sad... It's so sad!

24
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,129
I remember now...

25
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,842
I forgot when,
but you showed it to me, didn't you?

26
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,304
With a twinkle in your eye,

27
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,473
you proudly said it was
a memento of your father.

28
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,727
That was the pipe box, wasn't it?
It was an amazing box.

29
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,313
No wonder you're so proud of it...

30
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:32,486
Even though I took it and smashed it,
you only laughed.

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,783
You were smiling when
we kicked you and tossed you.

32
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,494
It was a great smile.

33
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,746
Really...

34
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,376
Hold it in, Rokusuke! They'll all be gone.

35
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,336
If we let this moment go,

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,213
there will be no other chance
to get out of the village.

37
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,966
But Kanpachi is...!

38
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,593
It's for the village,

39
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:00,014
we have to do something and
make our way to that village!

40
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,859
Yeah...

41
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,236
Funerals are awesome, aren't they!

42
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,408
I wanna do that again.

43
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,624
One...two...

44
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,628
three people... got away again...

45
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,715
Looks like we can have another funeral.

46
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,862
This is...

47
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,364
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.

48
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,824
You are...?

49
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,080
Naruto Uzumaki! Right now,
I'm in the middle of training.

50
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,624
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,919
H-Hey! I said hey!

52
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,421
Hang in there!

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,680
This is training too...!

54
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,163
I can't give up yet! Not yet!

55
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,383
The escort for the ruler of
the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,

56
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,926
was completed without incident!

57
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,594
Well done.

58
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,390
That's Lady Tsunade's...!

59
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,228
Excellent dumplings are always
from the Leaf Village, aren't they?

60
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,773
That was my last one!

61
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,991
Mission Accomplished!

62
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,452
I came to pound the pirates
of the Gottani Channel

63
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,454
with the fist of love!

64
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,958
If they take this opportunity
to rehabilitate themselves,

65
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,587
it's worth while to shed a tear!

66
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,222
I'll have your team do it for me.

67
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,183
Yes?

68
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:55,564
Even though we're already busy,
that Naruto brought in more work.

69
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,568
After this, Guy has the S-rank mission.

70
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,739
The client picked him,
so he must depart today.

71
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,450
So, do it without Guy.

72
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,368
That's pretty straightforward...

73
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,247
I called Neji Hyuga, Tenten and Lee.

74
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,665
Ohh!

75
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:18,212
My pupils can undertake the fulfillment
of this mission without incident!

76
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,421
Wait...

77
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,133
Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.

78
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:28,222
Why can't it just be my pupils,
who are loved by all the world?

79
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,141
Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!

80
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,267
It just is.

81
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,151
Hidden Leaf Hospital

82
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,237
Those three people that Naruto saved
came all the way

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,657
from the Katabami Gold Mine
to request a mission.

84
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,869
Katabami Gold Mine is one of
the Land of Rivers' greatest mines,

85
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,498
but about half a year ago, hooligans
calling themselves the Kurosuki family

86
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,669
appeared on the pretext of guarding it,
and took control of the village...

87
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,714
killing villagers for
no particular reason.

88
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,383
How vile!

89
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,969
Your mission is this:

90
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,513
Once those three have
regained their strength,

91
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,184
escort them to Katabami Gold Mine
and eliminate the Kurosuki family.

92
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,894
It's a simple mission.

93
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,898
Well anyway, it must be a group
of punks who're after money.

94
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,985
Why did you call me for
such an easy mission?

95
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
Who do you think you are?

96
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:33,328
I'm busy searching for
Sasuke and training, and...!

97
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,748
You forced your way into missions
that you weren't called for.

98
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,834
It's not a Genin's place
to choose his missions!

99
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,379
Would you like to be sent back
to the Academy? Well?!

100
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,548
-Neji Hyuga!
-Yes!

101
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,383
You're the leader!

102
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,970
It will be good training for you
to try to tame the unstable.

103
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,265
I don't want to... but, I'll do it!

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,896
I'll go continue my training!

105
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,606
Hey Naruto!

106
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,321
Please excuse them. They have no manners...

107
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,950
Wait!

108
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,042
Those little brats...!

109
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,377
What the heck do they think missions are?!

110
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,963
-Umm, excuse me?
-What?!

111
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,798
The Kurosuki Family...

112
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,218
What did you say their boss' name was?

113
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,221
-Raiga!
-That's what I thought...

114
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,513
What?

115
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,892
Well, on a previous mission,
I heard a rumor about him.

116
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,229
A rumor...?

117
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:44,399
Pervy Sage hasn't returned...
I'm forced to go on a mission...

118
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,277
Oh, this is irritating...

119
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,156
-Sakura!
-Naruto?

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,326
What's going on? A bird?

121
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,205
Yesterday I found it injured
and treated it, but...

122
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,389
Sakura, that's amazing!

123
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,268
But poor thing.

124
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,937
It's separated from its friends.

125
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,069
Naruto!

126
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,531
Oh, sorry, did I intrude?

127
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,324
You intruded big time!

128
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,909
No, no!

129
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:41,081
Don't turn your back,
no need to grovel to youth.

130
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,791
Sakura, Hello!

131
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,212
-Hello!
-What did you come here for?

132
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,964
-Just to have a word.
-Huh? What the...?!

133
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,841
Oh, Sakura, goodbye!

134
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,926
-Hey! What was that?!
-She went wild, didn't she?

135
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,179
She should act her age.

136
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,017
Ichiraku

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,477
What?! The boss of the Kurosuki family

138
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,146
is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?

139
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,900
Yeah, it's exclusive information
from our respected teacher, Guy.

140
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,488
Who're the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?

141
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,781
Naruto, you said that

142
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,659
you fought in the Land of
the Waves mission, didn't you?

143
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,869
At that time...

144
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,624
Oh, Zabuza! And?

145
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,129
And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei
fought Kisame Hoshigaki.

146
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,840
I heard that
you met them there too, Naruto.

147
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,262
Oh! I know that guy!

148
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,555
Those two were once called

149
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,934
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

150
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,771
And at that time,
who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?

151
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh!

152
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,985
The man called Itachi! And then?

153
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,695
You still don't understand?

154
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,783
If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,

155
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:02,371
then he's probably tied to Itachi
who was with Kisame.

156
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,664
Oh! And?

157
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,292
Tell me, who's after Itachi?

158
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,462
I know! Sasuke!

159
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,714
That's right!

160
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,634
We can probably get
the clue to Sasuke's whereabouts

161
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,927
at Katabami Gold Mine!

162
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,595
But...

163
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,889
If that's what Guy Sensei said then...

164
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,684
Don't say anything rude!

165
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,647
It's information that's 100% reliable!

166
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,986
Starting now,
while guarding Rokusuke and the others,

167
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,822
we head toward Katabami Gold Mine

168
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,366
to fulfill our mission to
wipe out the Kurosuki family.

169
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,035
There's a shop I'm familiar
with close to the gold mine.

170
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,121
Let's make that the base.

171
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,748
What do you mean
a shop you're familiar with?

172
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,584
That's the fun part of the trip.

173
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,672
That aside, that Naruto is late...

174
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,049
If the source of the information
is Guy Sensei,

175
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,176
maybe he couldn't quite trust it?

176
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,179
That's not true!
Naruto will definitely come!

177
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,891
That's because Guy Sensei's
information is correct!

178
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,477
Whatever.

179
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,564
Here I am!

180
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,984
We're all here so...!

181
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,486
Is that for you to say?!

182
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,197
Let's go!

183
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,451
So...which way?

184
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,105
Don't be so anxious, Rokusuke,

185
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,733
Those guys will save our town.

186
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,697
It's post-meal training!

187
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,452
I won't lose!

188
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,377
I won't lose!

189
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,133
How long do you intend to rest here?!

190
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,012
If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi
from the burial...

191
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,014
Give it up...

192
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,808
How long do you think
it's been since that happened?

193
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,018
It's painful but...

194
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:42,822
I remember...this sleepiness.
The shop is close by.

195
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,034
You say you're sleepy,
and are you walking in your sleep?!

196
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,410
It's okay.

197
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:52,666
I slept while on a marathon on
this road for three days straight.

198
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,792
You are joking, right?

199
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,418
It's true.

200
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,547
The track meet of my youth
with Guy Sensei.

201
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,007
My body still remembers it.

202
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,426
I've gotten sleepy.

203
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,054
Hey, Bushy Brow, are you really okay?

204
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:11,643
That's right. In this area,
there's the scent of spicy curry.

205
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,271
Curry? Now that you mention it...

206
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,943
That's right!
Over there, it's... the Curry of Life Shop!

207
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,741
Grandma Sansho!

208
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
Oh my... Oh goodness!

209
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,287
I haven't seen you for a while!

210
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,831
-Oh my my my!
-You're looking well!

211
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,625
This is the shop Lee is familiar with?

212
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,505
That mountain is the Katabami Gold Mine

213
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,767
Grandma Sansho's curry saved my life.

214
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,353
So you're saying it's delicious curry?

215
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:59,482
No, it really saved my life.
I'm indebted to this curry.

216
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,153
It was when I'd just become a Genin ...

217
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:07,198
When Guy Sensei gave me
a special training routine.

218
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,996
Oh my, that's right. I remember.

219
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,583
Do your best!

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,587
Oh my...

221
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,964
Hey Grandma Sansho!

222
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,136
Oh my, they've come again!

223
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,145
Those people are running in their sleep.

224
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,069
Karashi! Karashi!

225
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:50,408
If you had that kind of energy,
you wouldn't lose to the bullies.

226
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:57,749
Oh my, I might have said too much.

227
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,876
Curry of Life Shop

228
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,523
Oh my! It's the third day.

229
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,817
They've been running the whole time.

230
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,364
Oh my. What a problem.

231
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,299
I wonder if he's hungry...?

232
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,476
What a pickle! He's not waking up!

233
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,770
Maybe I didn't use enough spice?

234
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,163
Karashi...

235
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,084
I've never seen a person
who works this hard.

236
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:28,631
Oh really... so you want to help
this young man too...?

237
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,819
This is the curry of life.

238
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,659
Now! Grandma Sansho went to
the trouble of making this curry.

239
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,744
Let's eat!

240
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,038
I'm digging in!

241
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:31,069
Yum! This is yummy-yum delicious!

242
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,156
Delicious! The use of spices is wonderful!

243
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,868
And this rice
goes perfectly with the curry!

244
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,217
Delicious!

245
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,096
By the way, I don't see Karashi.

246
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,891
Karashi saw how hard you worked

247
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,477
and became a bright kid
full of energy, but...

248
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,606
He got too much energy and left for town.

249
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,024
What?

250
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:14,821
I was wrong to keep telling him
to be stronger.

251
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,239
"I'm going to be a man!

252
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,741
"I'm going to be part of
the Kurosuki family," he said.

253
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:27,292
Oh my! I'm not blaming you. Don't worry.

254
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,376
It's too late.

255
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,879
I'm responsible...

256
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,380
Oh my.

257
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,173
Neji!

258
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,926
Please include Karashi's rescue
into our mission!

259
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,762
We'll bring him back from
the road of evil!

260
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,477
It's fine.

261
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,777
We'll use this shop as a base
and take a good look into the village.

262
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,071
Then we'll come up with a strategy
and spring into action.

263
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,197
Yes!

264
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,369
You guys await orders here.

265
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,915
Because it's dangerous
if the Kurosuki family finds us.

266
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,336
It's a disaster!

267
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,841
Rokusuke! Rokusuke! He's gone!

268
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,513
I'm sure he went to town alone!

269
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:23,932
That's not good!

270
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,184
If those guys find Rokusuke...!

271
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,396
Now that it's come to this,

272
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,148
we don't have time
to come up with a strategy!

273
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,900
Let's get right to it!

274
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,820
No! We'll get right to it!

275
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,200
Let's hurry.

276
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,040
Wait for me, Kanpachi, I'm coming now...

277
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,964
Someone... is coming...

278
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,011
Aw, again... I have to put on a funeral!

279
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,153
Crappy news pass us by

280
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:23,032
And you become speechless

281
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,621
My voice is way too soft

282
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,792
So you don't answer

283
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

284
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

285
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,846
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

286
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:50,351
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

287
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,105
Yeah

288
00:21:54,188 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

289
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,781
Yeah

290
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:09,328
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

291
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,957
Yeah

292
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

293
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:24,218
Yeah

294
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,610
You taught me that day.

295
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,236
If you cook with great care,

296
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,615
you can save someone's life
with just one serving of curry.

297
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,617
Even for a person like me,

298
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,244
with intense effort,
it's not an impossibility...

299
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,996
That's what I thought.

300
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,958
You were far more admirable
back then, Karashi.

301
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,002
But...

302
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,464
Next time: "A Lesson Learned!
The Iron Fist of Love!"
