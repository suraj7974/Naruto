1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:16,267
<=title>

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,936
Running like a fugitive,

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

5
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

6
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,239
My throat dry like it's withering

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,035
For no single one,

8
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,831
To none does belong,

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,712
This time is ours, right now...

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,008
Unraveling the pain,

11
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,885
Unraveling our hearts,

12
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,766
Stifling our breath,

14
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,601
Reaching for beyond,

15
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

16
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:09,695
In fighting and in love

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

18
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,827
Yes, we are on the way

19
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,501
I wanna rock...

20
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,921
Rockin' my heart

21
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,784
I see. Sakura, you've come, too.

22
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,415
Now you can formally register
for the Chunin Exam.

23
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,794
What do you mean?

24
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,588
Actually, from the start,

25
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:14,718
only three-man squads could
apply and take the exams.

26
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,972
But Sensei, you said that the decision
to take the exams

27
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,640
was up to the individual.

28
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,934
Yes... I said that.

29
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,061
Were you lying?

30
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,480
Yes, I was...

31
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,067
If I said that,

32
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,905
Sasuke and Naruto would probably
forcefully convince you to take it.

33
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,451
Even if you didn't have
the will to apply,

34
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,662
if Sasuke asks you

35
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,999
you would attempt to take
the exams half-heartedly.

36
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,461
For Sasuke's sake and,
well, Naruto's.

37
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,963
Then, if...

38
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,425
it had only been Sasuke and
Naruto who had come here?

39
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,969
I would've stopped the Exam here.

40
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,055
I wouldn't have felt like letting
them go beyond this point.

41
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,143
But...you guys came here
on your own will.

42
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,061
Sakura!

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,522
Naruto!

44
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,400
And, Sasuke!

45
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm glad you came.

46
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,033
You're a team I'm proud of.

47
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,243
Now then, go on!

48
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,038
Okay! Let's go!

49
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:53,067
Genin Takedown!
All Nine Rookies Face Off!

50
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,071
W-Wow!

51
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,700
W-What's with...this?

52
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,084
There are so many of them...

53
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,628
Could it be that they're all applicants?

54
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,513
They...all look...immensely strong...

55
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,309
Sasuke, you're late!

56
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,315
I thought I'd be able to see you
for the first time in awhile,

57
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,985
so I was waiting in excitement.

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,240
Get away from Sasuke!
Ino-Pig!

59
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,617
Oh, my. It's Sakura.

60
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,578
Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh...
Ugly!

61
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,122
What did you say?!

62
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,085
What's up with this?

63
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,840
Are you guys going to take
this bothersome Exam, too?

64
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,591
Oh, it's the idiot trio.

65
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,802
Quit calling us that!

66
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,846
Man, this is a freaking bother...

67
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,056
Shikamaru Nara.

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,059
Always complaining,
has no motivation.

69
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,811
He's a bellyaching idiot.

70
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,026
Choji Akimichi.

71
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,944
He's always eating something.

72
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,904
That's all he is, a fat idiot.

73
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:25,034
Sasuke...is mine. Bleah!

74
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,952
Ino Yamanaka.

75
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,956
She's always fighting with Sakura.
She's her rival.

76
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,374
A Sasuke-crazy idiot.

77
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,252
Yahoo, I found you!

78
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,130
My my, everybody's here.

79
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,466
H-Hello...

80
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,425
Oh...

81
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,137
Hinata Hyuga.

82
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,307
She's a weird person who turns
her eyes away whenever I look at her!

83
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,977
She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.

84
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,107
Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.

85
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,817
They're louder than I am!

86
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,612
He always brings his dog and
always has a bossy look.

87
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,863
He really annoys me!

88
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:06,992
Shino Aburame.

89
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:11,330
As for this guy, I really don't get him!

90
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,082
He's a type I'm not good with.

91
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,125
What did you say?

92
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,045
You guys, too?!
Man.

93
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,047
Ha! I see.

94
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,051
This means all nine Genin rookies
are taking the Exam, eh...!

95
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:24,968
Now then...

96
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,304
How far can we go?

97
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,014
Eh...Sasuke?

98
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:29,973
Hmph!...

99
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,101
You're mighty confident. Kiba.

100
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,853
We've trained a great deal, so...

101
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,605
We won't lose to you guys!

102
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,774
Shut up!

103
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,319
I don't know about Sasuke,
but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!

104
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,571
I'm sorry. Naruto...

105
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,116
Kiba didn't mean it like that...

106
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,034
Huh?

107
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,457
Akamaru, you've become
tasty-looking...

108
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,047
What?

109
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:09,847
Don't step on it.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,806
Huh?

111
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,142
I said, don't step on it.

112
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,060
You're...gonna eat that?

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,606
Hey, you guys!

114
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,318
You should be a little quieter.

115
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,117
You guys are the "rookie nine"...
fresh out of the academy, right?

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,913
Carrying on like that
with cute faces...Man.

117
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,583
This isn't a field trip.

118
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,668
Who're you? Acting all haughty!

119
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,922
I'm Kabuto Yakushi.
Anyway, take a good look around you.

120
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,906
Behind you...
They're from the Rain Village.

121
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,073
They're hot-tempered.

122
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,868
Everyone's tense before the Exam.

123
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,121
I thought I'd warn you guys
before you get your butts whipped...

124
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,294
I guess it can't be helped.

125
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,214
You're rookies who don't know
left from right...

126
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,508
You remind me of my old self.

127
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,303
You're Kabuto...right?

128
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,930
Yes...

129
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,932
Then, is this your second time?

130
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,308
No...

131
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,268
It's my seventh time.

132
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,603
Huh?!

133
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,608
This Exam is only held twice a year,
so it's now my fourth year.

134
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,987
Then that means you know
a lot about these exams?!

135
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,988
Kind of...

136
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,574
No kidding.
Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?

137
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,077
But you haven't passed.

138
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,996
Yeah, well, that is the case, yes...

139
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,209
Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?

140
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,545
Man, this is utterly bothersome...

141
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,384
Then, maybe I'll give a bit of
information to my cute juniors.

142
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,762
With these Ninja Info Cards.

143
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,389
Ninja Info Cards...?

144
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,349
To put it simply,

145
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,186
they're cards that have information burned
into them and coded with Chakra.

146
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,068
I spent four whole years gathering
information for this Exam.

147
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,405
There are close to two hundred
of these cards.

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,324
They are pure white to the eye...

149
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,411
To open the data on these cards...

150
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,913
What're you doing?

151
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,790
The way it works is that
no one can see the info

152
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,500
without using my Chakra...

153
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,044
For example...Like this...

154
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,507
\Whoa, awesome!
What information is this?

155
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,969
The number of test-takers and
participating nations,

156
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,972
and the number of applicants
from each respective village

157
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,851
is individually displayed.

158
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,312
Why do you think that

159
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,731
the Chunin Exam is jointly
conducted in the first place?

160
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,074
It's said it's done to deepen
friendship among nations first

161
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,495
and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,665
"It's said"?

163
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,833
That's right.

164
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,463
The real aim is in the checking of
Shinobi levels of neighboring nations

165
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,175
and keeping power balance equal.

166
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,886
Power...Equal?

167
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,515
Why such bothersome things?

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,728
If that's not done,

169
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,981
the weak nations will be invaded by
the strong nations in no time at all

170
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,067
and may end up being
controlled unilaterally.

171
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:56,114
There's a point to mutual supervision.
Probably.

172
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,032
Hmph...

173
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,784
Of those cards,

174
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,037
are there ones with
detailed individual information?

175
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,538
Yes, there are...

176
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,999
Are there ones you're concerned about?

177
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,709
Yes, there are!

178
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,006
The information for the applicants
this time around is not perfect,

179
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,092
but is burned in and saved.

180
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,260
You guys included...

181
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,556
About those "ones you're
concerned about," who you know.

182
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,851
Anything's fine, tell me their information
and I'll retrieve it for you.

183
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:30,065
Gaara of the Sand Village,
and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.

184
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,984
Oh, you even know names.

185
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,069
That makes it quick.

186
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,289
Here they are!

187
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,042
Please show me.

188
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,260
Here they are!

189
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,887
Please show me.

190
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:10,105
I don't really get what's going on,
but I'll pretend like I do.

191
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,149
Well then, first is Rock Lee.

192
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,032
He's one year older than you guys.

193
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,620
His mission experience,
twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.

194
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,789
His squad leader is Guy...

195
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,542
In just this year, his Taijutsu
has drastically improved, but...

196
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,502
His other skills are not good at all.

197
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,341
Last year, he'd attracted attention as
a Genin rookie with his ability,

198
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,636
but didn't participate
in the Chunin Exam.

199
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,891
This is his first time taking the exams,
same as you guys...

200
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,853
Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team...

201
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,234
Huh? Hyuga?

202
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,863
Next...is Gaara of the Desert.

203
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,290
His mission experience,
eight C-ranks. B-ranks...

204
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,126
Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh...

205
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,670
He's a Shinobi from a different land
and is a rookie,

206
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,714
so there is no further
detailed information.

207
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,008
But...

208
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,804
It seems he has returned from
all of his missions uninjured.

209
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:30,060
B-rank as a Genin...
But uninjured...?!

210
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,479
What is this guy?

211
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:48,495
Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,
Waterfall, Sound...

212
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,082
There are lots of exceptional Genins
from those villages

213
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,459
who have come to take
the Exam this year as well.

214
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,172
As far as the Village Hidden
in Sound goes,

215
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,175
it's a village of a small nation that
just sprang up in recent years,

216
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,135
so there isn't much information...

217
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,224
At any rate,

218
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,518
they're all Hidden Villages
with nothing but crackerjacks.

219
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,647
That kind of makes you lose
your confidence.

220
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,525
Why are you saying that now?

221
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,442
In other words...

222
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,987
all of the applicants who
have gathered here...

223
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,321
That's right!

224
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,448
Not just Lee and Gaara,

225
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,327
but they're all choice top elite
Genin from each nation.

226
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,829
Hmm.

227
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,832
This isn't going to be easy.

228
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,003
I can't go along with this!

229
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,797
They may be your subordinates now,

230
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,550
but they are children
who were my students.

231
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,676
If it's about them I know...

232
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,345
It's as you say, Iruka.

233
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,516
It's not going to be that easy.

234
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,934
You're too eager.

235
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,521
I postponed my team's test-taking
for one year

236
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,148
and took care to build up
their skills.

237
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,943
Have them take the Exam after
they've enjoyed their life a little bit more.

238
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:02,861
Hmph...

239
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,572
They might be too easygoing.

240
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,618
But they will surpass
your guys in no time.

241
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,829
That's enough.

242
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,999
That's as far as
the rookie matter goes.

243
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,542
Now then, next...

244
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,629
I'll take recommendations for Genin
other than rookies.

245
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,633
Well! Don't pour cold water on this...

246
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,971
I said that, nevertheless...

247
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,601
I wonder if even the fearless ones
are frightened just this time around.

248
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,896
Stubborn as he is,

249
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,023
he's still consumed by this atmosphere
and number of people.

250
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,358
He's tense.

251
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,568
It can't be helped.

252
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:48,990
Even though everyone is a Genin,
we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.

253
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,535
I'm very, very uneasy.

254
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:53,953
But...

255
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,874
It's kind of tough looking at
Naruto who's not himself.

256
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,669
Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.

257
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,422
Say...Naruto! Don't be so scared.

258
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,382
Huh?

259
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,769
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

260
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,648
I won't lose to any of you!
Got it?!

261
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,655
Say! What's with him?!

262
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,700
That idiot would never
get depressed! Absurd!

263
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,577
It won't do any good to
provoke everyone!

264
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,537
Don't tell me!

265
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,789
If I don't tell it to you,
who do I tell it to?!

266
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,626
-What did you say?!
-Oh, I feel better.

267
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,711
Hmph...

268
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,887
Isn't that the guy from before...?

269
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,306
The dog's bark is
bigger than its bite.

270
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,850
Is he an idiot...?

271
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,436
He's mighty high-spirited.

272
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,645
He's hot-headed, eh.

273
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,441
Lee, maybe you did
not bully him enough.

274
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,572
Did you hear?

275
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,659
Sound Village is a minor
Hidden Village of a small nation.

276
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,077
That's offensive.

277
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,456
Maybe I'll...play with them a bit.

278
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,711
Yes, being referred to as something
like leftover Shinobis and all.

279
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,881
We'll add this to his data.

280
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,303
Those Sound Shinobis
are brutal in their own way.

281
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,230
I won't lose to any of you,
you say?

282
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,648
You said it...!

283
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,900
That idiot...

284
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,195
In no time at all, he's made enemies
of his surroundings.

285
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,114
What're you talking big for?! You!

286
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,408
But, I just said what was true, I say!

287
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,540
E-Everyone, that was a joke.

288
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,834
This guy's quite an idiot, you see...

289
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,754
After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,
scatterbrained things

290
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,089
and gets carried away,

291
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,841
so please don't concern
yourself with him.

292
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,719
Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!

293
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,387
I'm going to kick your butt!

294
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,015
Shall we do it?

295
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,433
Let's do it.

296
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,834
Learn how to read atmosphere
already, you!

297
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,252
Fine!

298
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,683
These guys...are the Sound Village...

299
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,522
He dodged it!

300
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,899
I can see through that speed.

301
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,957
I see... It's that kind of attack, eh?

302
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,919
What's going on?

303
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,421
He was supposed to have evaded it.

304
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,089
Why'd that happen to his glasses?

305
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,341
Probably grazed the tip of his nose.

306
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:39,053
He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.

307
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,016
Huh?!

308
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,483
Oh! He puked?!

309
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,902
K-Kabuto?

310
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,986
Huh?!

311
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,829
Hah!

312
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,542
Hey, Kabuto!

313
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,877
Are you okay?!

314
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,587
Yeah...I'm okay.

315
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,005
Really?

316
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,550
Oh, so he's not so special.

317
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,470
Even though he's a veteran who's
been taking the exams for four whole years.

318
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,931
Write this on your card.

319
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,726
The three from Sound village...
Doubtless Chunin.

320
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,024
Kabuto should've totally read the attack...

321
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,818
But why did he vomit?

322
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,576
Lee. How about that technique just now?

323
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,787
I had no problem reading the speed.

324
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,705
There's some kind of trick...

325
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,087
Silence! Degenerates!

326
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,811
Sorry to keep you waiting...I

00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:16,609
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the
first test of the Chunin Exam.

328
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,877
It feels like the chance to show off
the fruits of our training has finally come.

329
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,337
Well, no matter what kind
of test it is,

330
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,339
it's gonna be a snap!

331
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,092
I'm picturing Sasuke and them
bowing to me and saying,

332
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,095
"Naruto, we're really no match for you."

333
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,430
Huh? Is this for real?!

334
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:14,352
Next episode: "Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!"

335
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,687
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!

336
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,774
