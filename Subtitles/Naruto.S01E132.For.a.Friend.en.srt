1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,929
For a Friend!

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,681
What did you say?!

22
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,143
You mean to say that only rookies
went after Sasuke?!

23
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,312
It really couldn't be helped...

24
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,565
the situation in
the Village being how it is...

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,656
And anyway...

26
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,200
I've taken the minimally
required measures.

27
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,998
Hey, hey!

28
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,459
Your mission has already been assigned!

29
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,587
Uh, I'm gonna go do an errand
and will be back shortly...

30
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,756
Don't worry.

31
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,763
Geez...

32
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,562
Kakashi Sensei!

33
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,648
Kakashi Sensei!

34
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:32,695
It's already been two days
since Sasuke left the village...

35
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,197
And Naruto and the others who went in
pursuit haven't come back either.

36
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,033
And neither has Lee...

37
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,871
I know. I've more or less
heard the whole story.

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,792
I...believe in Naruto!

39
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:51,255
I believe him, but if something were
to happen to Naruto and Sasuke...

40
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,137
Sakura, you don't need to
worry about anything.

41
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,598
Leave this to me.

42
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,282
Summoning Jutsu!

43
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,880
First of all, I want you guys to
fan out in all directions

44
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,299
in pursuit of Naruto and Sasuke's scent.

45
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,177
Naruto and Sasuke you said?

46
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,971
Did something happen to the two of them?

47
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,100
I'll explain later...
Right now, time is of essence.

48
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,770
Okay.

49
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,521
As soon as you confirm that
you've detected the scent,

50
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,941
call me and I'll be there immediately.

51
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,901
All right! Scatter!

52
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,832
Well, I guess since she saw them
fight before her very eyes...

53
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,627
it's useless to tell her not to worry.

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,426
Stop!

55
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,348
Damn...

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,433
I can't stop...

57
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,832
Sasuke... Stop with revenge.

58
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,125
What?!

59
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,336
Even if you were successful
in carrying out your revenge,

60
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,463
all that will come out of it
is a sense of emptiness.

61
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,049
Shut up! What do you know?!

62
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,720
Don't say that so knowingly!

63
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,972
Well...calm down.

64
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,976
Neither you nor I could
call ourselves lucky.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,478
Of that much I'm certain.

66
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,190
But it could be worse.

67
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:20,279
Both you and I have found
precious comrades, right?

68
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,243
We understand that all the more
because we've lost them once.

69
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,037
I taught you Chidori

70
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,207
because you now have precious people.

71
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,963
That power isn't something to be used
against your comrades or for revenge.

72
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:42,092
You know what that power
should be used for.

73
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,136
I'm gonna win no matter what!

74
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,430
Don't get so carried away!

75
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,767
I was too naïve...

76
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,729
Watching them, they might actually
be intent on killing each other...

77
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,450
Kakashi Sensei...

78
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,415
Please let me get there in time!

79
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,224
I already said this earlier but...

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,687
In truth, you were waiting
for this too, weren't you?

81
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,525
Neither Kakashi nor Sakura
are present right now.

82
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,363
So there's nobody here to stop us
like that time before.

83
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,989
You...!

84
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,494
This time around we're gonna
settle this for real!

85
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,665
I will take you down!

86
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,217
Chidori!

87
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,517
You idiot...

88
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,313
Same here! I'm gonna clobber you...

89
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,650
and take you back home even
if I have to drag you!

90
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,236
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

91
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,418
Rasengan!

92
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,377
It wasn't meaningless...

93
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,008
To me, you became my closest friend.

94
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:34,306
Sasuke actually came out
and said that...to me...

95
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,268
And that's exactly the reason why
I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.

96
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,749
Damn...

97
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,294
Damn you!

98
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,900
Damn...

99
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,946
He was able to counter
my full power of Chidori to that extent...

100
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,866
That jutsu...

101
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,005
Damn...

102
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,137
Naruto, to what extent...!

103
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,100
That loser...

104
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,775
Naruto...!

105
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:22,414
Well, your limit is two blows...
that's about it.

106
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,420
And if I try to use more than that...
what will happen?

107
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,966
The third blow won't initiate.

108
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,676
Remember that well.

109
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,680
If you try to initiate the Jutsu forcibly...

110
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,058
not only will the Art not
initiate properly,

111
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,642
but your Chakra will become zero...

112
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,188
In the worst case scenario
it will cost you your life!

113
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,401
Damn... I can't waste a blow...

114
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,613
It wouldn't serve any purpose
if we cancel each other like earlier.

115
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:06,124
There's...no longer any mistake about this.

116
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,926
You...really intended...

117
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,021
You really intended to...

118
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,865
Sasuke...!

119
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,623
I will use numerous speedy techniques
and Jutsu to create an opening.

120
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,878
And then...I will make a hit with Chidori.

121
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,008
Sasuke...

122
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,604
Did you know, Naruto...

123
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:15,152
Top-class Ninja should be
able to read each other's hearts

124
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,654
simply by an exchange of fists.

125
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,619
Even without saying anything...

126
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,961
You're naïve, Naruto.

127
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,674
How about it?

128
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,636
Were you really able to read inside...

129
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,764
this heart of mine?

130
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,686
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

131
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,920
Sasuke... I knew that you were always alone.

132
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,175
At first, I was relieved when I found out

133
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,345
that there was a guy similar to myself.

134
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,310
And it also made me happy...

135
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,105
To tell the truth, I really wanted
to approach you right away.

136
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:42,197
But...I wasn't able to approach you...

137
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,535
-Awesome...
-You're incredible...

138
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,995
You were always able to do everything.

139
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,542
And moreover, you were always
being praised by everyone.

140
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,432
Because you and I were so different...

141
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,020
Because I didn't want to admit it,
I decided to call you my rival.

142
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,651
I didn't want to lose to you...

143
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,571
and I felt that even more strongly...

144
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,864
because I was called a loser.

145
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,036
Even when we were in the Squad Seven,

146
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,871
I continued to feel
the same way the whole time.

147
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,749
I'm stubborn...

148
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,420
And wasn't able to express
what I really felt...

149
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,677
What I really wanted was
to become like you.

150
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:52,642
You were what I aspired to...so...

151
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,105
You are one of the ones I want to fight.

152
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,819
I was really happy when you said that!

153
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:09,242
Those were your first words...
acknowledging me...

154
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,126
You and I both knew,

155
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,754
without us even having to
have an exchange of fists!

156
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,590
From that time on...

157
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,468
Even without saying anything...

158
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,430
The fact that...

159
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,641
we are friends!

160
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,938
It's not without meaning...

161
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,900
To me you're...

162
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,155
my closest friend.

163
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:53,161
However...you're trying to
take me down for real.

164
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,705
Right now, I don't really know

165
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,001
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not.

166
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,217
Thinking that we were friends...

167
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,177
That might have been...

168
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,764
That might have been just me...

169
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,227
It's too late now!

170
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,312
Naruto!

171
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,949
If that's the case...I'm...

172
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,665
really lame, aren't I...

173
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,544
Sasuke!

174
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,646
But... It can't be helped, can it?

175
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,726
I don't know why but...

176
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,815
I don't know why...

177
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,859
But I...

178
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,198
I...

179
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,829
don't want you...

180
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,254
you to be taken away
by someone like Orochimaru!

181
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,982
You managed to divert it
with your left hand,

182
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,985
but it was meaningless.

183
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,698
You won't be able to use any hand sign

184
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,910
or that Jutsu earlier anymore.

185
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,168
This is the end!

186
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,982
Wh-What's...

187
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,234
that red Chakra...?

188
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,615
Where does he get that
kind of power from?!

189
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,911
W-What the heck...is this?!

190
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,168
His shoulder injury is healing...

191
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,922
That's unbelievable!

192
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,996
Sasuke!

193
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,417
I'm not gonna let
Orochimaru take you away!

194
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,047
I will stop you,

195
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,719
even if I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs!

196
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:15,483
When I recalled the parts one by one,

197
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:21,906
I felt as though
I had understood everything

198
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

199
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:32,625
which I kept so close to me

200
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:38,006
Speechless nights,

201
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,468
a hint of warmth,

202
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:48,933
and this distant yearning for you

203
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,186
I live,

204
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,359
simply repeating this cycle

205
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:06,868
Held in my two hands

206
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,121
A droplet of time

207
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:17,837
Softly clutching forgotten memories

208
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,715
Lost words

209
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,186
I'll keep these thoughts...

210
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,569
Don't you talk stupid like that!

211
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,615
I don't care what you're thinking anymore!

212
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,451
I won't let you go to Orochimaru's
place no matter what!

213
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:53,498
I'm taking you back to the village
even if I have to drag you there!

214
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,084
Sasuke! You're my...

215
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,380
