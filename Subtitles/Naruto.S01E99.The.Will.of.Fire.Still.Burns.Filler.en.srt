1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,565
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,651
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,279
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,616
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,335
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:50,134
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,260
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:57,057
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,782
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

17
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,588
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,234
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja

22
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,487
even though I can't
use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

23
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,073
That would be the ultimate for me!

24
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,310
All right!
I'm going to do my best again today!

25
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,565
Oh! Bushy Brow!

26
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,650
Oh... Good morning, Naruto.

27
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,113
Hey, hey, did you already get checked out
by Old Lady Tsunade?

28
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,239
How was it, how was it?

29
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:43,163
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,

30
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,666
so we must do our best!

31
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,377
You're right.

32
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,588
Bushy Brow, you should get better
as soon as possible

33
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,672
and succeed in your mis...!

34
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,924
-Naruto!
-Naruto!

35
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,885
What's the matter?

36
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,303
It's Konohamaru!

37
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,513
Huh? What's wrong with Konohamaru?

38
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,224
He's in trouble.

39
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,810
In trouble?!

40
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,981
The Will of Fire Still Burns

41
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,489
At this rate,
we will have to open it by force.

42
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:21,410
Try it! Who do you think I am?!

43
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,203
I am the grandson of the Third Hokage!

44
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,915
If you go against me, then...

45
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,087
It means you're going against the Hokage!

46
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:37,009
We need Lady Tsunade
to assume her position immediately.

47
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,067
Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!

48
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,985
You'll get something even more terrible
if you come close to me.

49
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,489
Honorable grandson! Even for you...

50
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,661
There are things that can
and cannot be forgiven!

51
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,204
Shut up!

52
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,501
What is all this commotion
so early in the morning?

53
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,378
It's hurting my head.

54
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,545
Lady Tsunade...

55
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,679
-It's just one kid... What're you doing?
-Yes...

56
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,640
Get rid of him!

57
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,938
But it's the grandson of the Third Hokage!

58
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,607
It doesn't matter if
he's the grandson or the great grandson.

59
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,359
I am the granddaughter
of the First Hokage!

60
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,825
He might just open his eyes if he
gets roughed up a little. Now move it!

61
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,326
-Yes!
-Yes!

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,497
Wait!

63
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,541
Naruto?!

64
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,669
Hey, hold on there.

65
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,713
I don't really know what's going on,

66
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,383
but don't be so rough with Konohamaru,
Old Lady Tsunade.

67
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,385
An acquaintance of yours?

68
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,262
Yes, yes...

69
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,058
I'll do the convincing, leave it to me.

70
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,310
Then, do something by the end of the day!

71
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,025
Oh, Lady Tsunade... Please wait!

72
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,992
Excuse me.

73
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,495
Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has already
been discharged from the hospital.

74
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,458
I'm actually here to see Lee today.
Is he in the rehabilitation room?

75
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,672
Not yet. That's not like him to be late.

76
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,341
I see.

77
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,602
The probability of a successful surgery
is 50%, at best.

78
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,063
And if it fails, you'll die!

79
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,701
Hey, Konohamaru.
What are you doing in there?!

80
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,166
Hurry up and come out.
Then let's go eat some ramen.

81
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,590
Don't worry. It's on me!

82
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,055
You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!

83
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,561
All right! You can have eggs too!
How about that!

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,232
At least answer me!

85
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,317
Shut up, you fool!

86
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,946
You called me a fool!

87
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,574
Open up already! I'll break in! Hey!

88
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,035
Try if you can!

89
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:54,164
W-Why you...!

90
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,089
-Naruto...
-Naruto!

91
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,766
Oh, Lee... You're here.

92
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,228
S-Sakura!

93
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,189
I wanted to bring you this.

94
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,405
F-For... me?

95
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,407
Th-Thank you very much!

96
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,704
I-I'm sorry, Sakura.

97
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,830
No worries.

98
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,960
Sasuke is now recuperating at home.

99
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,795
Thanks to Lady Tsunade.

100
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,882
At this rate, seems like he'll be able
to get back to his duties very soon.

101
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,344
I see. That's very good.

102
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,806
Lady Tsunade is great, after all.

103
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,060
I think if you had her take a look,
you'd get better very quickly.

104
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,025
Yes...

105
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,612
But if there is something that I can do,

106
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,946
please feel free to tell me.

107
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,203
Thank you very much,Sakura.

108
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,955
Then I'll see you soon.

109
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,263
I would think that at least
one bar would be open.

110
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,809
There's no way.
What time do you think it is right now?

111
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,771
I can't drink sake, and I can't gamble.

112
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,858
This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,
is no fun at all.

113
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,985
Just like the Third Hokage.

114
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,153
Lady Tsunade!

115
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,948
Oh, I'm tired.

116
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,285
I just want to sit down and
have a drink somewhere.

117
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,540
I understand.

118
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,544
I will take you to a place where
you can sit and have a drink.

119
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,046
What?

120
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,050
But I will have you do your work!

121
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,604
Here now, go ahead. It's hot.

122
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,819
Shizune...you've suddenly
become very strict!

123
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:33,782
I haven't gotten strict.
It's probably that you were not aware.

124
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,034
Not aware?!

125
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,954
"If I can't get in the room,
then I don't have to work."

126
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,790
Isn't that what you were thinking?

127
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,419
And that's why you left it up to Naruto.

128
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,713
Could be...

129
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,466
This is the most recent list of Ninja.

130
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,470
The names and lineups of
the groups have changed a lot.

131
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:59,683
So please look through them.
And I mean, look through all of it!

132
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,394
Oh bother.

133
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,105
They have sweet rice cakes, too.

134
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,566
I don't like sweet things!

135
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,529
Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!

136
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:18,035
At least tell me why you're doing this!

137
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,495
Konohamaru!

138
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,080
Darn!

139
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,791
Everybody came here because
they're worried about you!

140
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,461
If you don't come out,
I'm going to drag you out of there!

141
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,254
Naruto Sacred Technique...

142
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,048
Sexy Jutsu!

143
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,888
Konohamaru, come out!

144
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:44,770
Konohamaru, hurry!

145
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:55,614
Hey! Say something at least!
This is so embarrassing!

146
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,744
Don't fool around with me!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

147
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,706
-Stop it already, Konohamaru!
-Stop it already, Konohamaru!

148
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,084
One, two...

149
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,048
-Uh, what is this?
-What the...?!

150
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,260
What's going on?!

151
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,639
Are you okay? Naruto?

152
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,020
This is the Old Man's room.

153
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,323
Eight D-rank missions,
three C-rank missions...

154
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,410
I see, very much like the Kurenai team.

155
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,165
We can easily figure out
what the Third Hokage was thinking.

156
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,547
This is the same as their parents' team.

157
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,718
I see.

158
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:05,684
Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty
and is well-balanced.

159
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,496
My shoulders are stiff.

160
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,582
I'm going to go get
some fresh air outside.

161
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,734
Success...

162
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,282
Success...

163
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,004
Naruto...

164
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,466
Uh... Darn!

165
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,886
If that's how you're going to be,
then I'm not going to go easy on you.

166
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,721
This is the Old Man's room!

167
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,349
I won't let anybody
use this room besides him!

168
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,810
The Old Man's...?

169
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,605
That's why, as his grandson,
I'm going to protect it!

170
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,483
Fool! This isn't the time for that!

171
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,902
The Leaf Village is in great danger!

172
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,030
So what?! It doesn't matter to me.

173
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,199
Are you seriously saying that?!

174
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,704
Oh, now I'm mad!

175
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:54,918
And I can easily tear down one
or two doors with my new powers...!

176
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,294
-Naruto!
-Naruto!

177
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,092
Old Lady Tsunade... Oh! Watch out!

178
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,857
W-Wow...

179
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,332
Listen Konohamaru.

180
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,834
The Hidden Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now!

181
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:22,797
Our forces have dropped to almost half,
and we have to finish our missions!

182
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,761
That's what I taught you!

183
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,807
Yeah... um... well...

184
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,434
But if we don't accomplish our missions,

185
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:39,189
that's letting other countries know
that the village has been weakened.

186
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,900
That's what Iruka Sensei taught you!

187
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,910
Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?

188
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,371
It's not that! It's not that at all.

189
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,581
Then what is it?

190
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,419
Soon, nobody will call me
honorable grandson.

191
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,546
Then I'll just become
plain old Konohamaru.

192
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,008
So what's wrong with plain old Konohamaru?

193
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,510
No...

194
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:13,473
Why, why?! You hated
being called honorable grandson!

195
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,145
Everybody's going to forget
about the Old Man.

196
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,107
The Old Man.

197
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,652
They're going to forget what
a great Ninja he was,

198
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,321
they're just going to put him away
like an old ashtray.

199
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,535
The new Hokage will make all kinds
of changes in the Leaf Village.

200
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,829
That's not true!

201
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,622
The Hidden Leaf Village is
the Hidden Leaf Village.

202
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,292
And besides,
nobody will forget about the Old Man!

203
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,503
No! They will never forget about him!

204
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,048
They will forget, I guarantee it.

205
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,592
-They won't forget!
-That's a lie!

206
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,054
It's not a lie!
You can't believe what I am saying?!

207
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,514
That's right, I can't!

208
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,016
Oh boy!

209
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,310
Come with me, Konohamaru!

210
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,521
We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade
to promise

211
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,107
that she won't change
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

212
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,400
And then on top of that,

213
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,236
we can get everybody to promise us
that they won't forget about the Old Man!

214
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,738
What?

215
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,990
Isn't that what you want?

216
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,542
I can't believe that I let
Lady Tsunade out of my sight!

217
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,592
Did you find her, Tonton?

218
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,692
Revitalizing the cells, I see.

219
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,038
-I've found you Lady Tsunade.
-What?

220
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,420
Lady Tsunade is studying?!

221
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,632
Be quiet! I can't concentrate.

222
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,301
Concentrate?!

223
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,971
I've never heard you use that word
except when you're gambling.

224
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,766
Is that Shizune's voice?

225
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,976
Shizune...

226
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,732
Do you remember that Medical Ninja
by the name of Kabuto?

227
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,113
-What about him?
-His ability to create new cells.

228
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,158
I was researching ways to use
that power on the patients.

229
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,869
For Lee?

230
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:46,835
If the 50% chance becomes 51%,
it's worth a try.

231
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:51,339
It really depends on the individual's traits.

232
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,385
Even for you,
it might be hard to acquire those powers.

233
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,265
I'll just have to try.

234
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,769
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

235
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,865
It can't be helped, Konohamaru.

236
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,493
I am the Third Hokage, after all.

237
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,329
If you don't like it,
you should just quit!

238
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,417
Everybody from the village is my family.

239
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,296
To protect the family,
that is the duty of a Hokage.

240
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,800
Oh! Old Man!

241
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,859
Just for today,
I'm making a special exception.

242
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,282
What's the matter Konohamaru?

243
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,076
Don't you want to see Old Lady Tsunade?

244
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,286
No.

245
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:16,549
I'll just have to do it.
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

246
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,804
It can't be helped, Konohamaru.
I am the Third Hokage, after all.

247
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,143
It can't be helped.
I am the honorable grandson, after all.

248
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:28,603
Huh?

249
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,482
I am Konohamaru of
the Hidden Leaf Village, after all!

250
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,611
H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!

251
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,865
What's going on with him? Hey Konohamaru!

252
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,457
-Lady Tsunade?
-Nothing...

253
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,519
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

254
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:14,983
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

255
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:19,821
On your still shoulder

256
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,492
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

257
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

258
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

259
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,507
"Each one of us

260
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,512
glows differently,"

261
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,348
you say laughingly

262
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:53,688
but you look most dazzling

263
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,234
Like a comet,

264
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:04,157
like the rainbow after the storm

265
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,870
You bring light

266
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,456
into my heart

267
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost

268
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:22,467
can be the answer

269
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:28,306
Let's promise

270
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,017
we won't cheat

271
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,021
Uh...like a shooting star, we do go ahead.

272
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,692
Back then, Sensei taught me

273
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,529
that I would grow up to become
a great Ninja

274
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,991
through lots of effort and
competition with my rivals.

275
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,951
His words put me at ease.

276
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,538
A path opened up for me
just when I was unsure of myself.

277
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,374
I realized that all I had to do
was try my best.

278
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,460
But now...

279
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,839
Next time: "Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi"
