1
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,175
Summoning Jutsu!

2
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,646
Oh, long time no see.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,774
We don't have much time
to get nostalgic.

4
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:24,900
We've got a mission.

5
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,032
That I see over there
is the Village of Artisans, isn't it?

6
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:35,745
Yeah. It's a village of professionals
who develop Ninja tools.

7
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,372
The exceptional Ninja tools
they develop are also

8
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:41,333
supplied to us
in the Five Great Nations...

9
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:45,212
But there's been
a strange rumor recently.

10
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,089
A strange rumor?

11
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,467
Something about them developing
the ultimate weapon

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,720
and attempting to antagonize
the Five Great Nations.

13
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,182
In other words, we should
search the village and...

14
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,895
verify whether or not
there is that ultimate weapon, right?

15
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,229
That's about the size of it.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,231
Piece of cake.

17
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:33,886
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

18
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:40,309
into your hands

19
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:59,286
The distance created between us
became too big,

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,876
because we were always together

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,091
Your honest reply, "See you..."

22
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:17,388
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

23
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:23,894
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

24
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

25
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,360
even if I'm not by your side

26
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:37,575
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

27
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:44,123
into your hands

28
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:49,712
I can feel it so close,

29
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:55,593
Our two hearts

30
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,436
Hey! Something strange is going on.

31
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,396
What is it?!

32
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,149
There's not a soul in the village!

33
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,860
I also found something terrible
on top of that.

34
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,944
What?!

35
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,620
It's that.

36
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,540
The coffin of Seimei, the founder of
the Village of Artisans.

37
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,000
Even his body is...

38
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,170
This is serious.

39
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,133
The artisans abandoned their village.
Where in the world did they go?

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,472
The Targeted Shukaku

41
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,398
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

42
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:57,112
Maybe I'll treat myself and have
two eggs in my ramen today.

43
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,284
Huh?

44
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,333
What's going on there?!

45
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,835
Did I keep you waiting by any chance?

46
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,880
Not really. I just got here a bit before.

47
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,008
That's good... Then, here.

48
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,886
I made sure to hand it to you.

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,056
Yeah, yeah. What a pain.

50
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,767
Just a minute!

51
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,395
What're you guys doing...

52
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,106
all in secret in a place like this
without even asking me?!

53
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,108
–Naruto?
–Huh?

54
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,694
You're terrible, just terrible, Sakura!

55
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,613
Here you won't even go out
on a date with me at all!

56
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,950
Why're you talking gibberish
all of a sudden?

57
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,285
Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch...

58
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,914
An errand for the Old Lady?

59
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,584
Yes. It seems a new poison
was discovered or something.

60
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,170
I delivered a list of
research medicinal substance

61
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,047
for Shikamaru's father to prepare.

62
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,424
Oh, that's it?!

63
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,634
Jeez, you jump to conclusions.

64
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,387
Oh, come to think of it,

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,058
an update report from Temari
has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.

66
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,810
An update report?

67
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,311
So? What exactly?

68
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:16,025
I heard that the Village Hidden in
the Sand started Ninja education,

69
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,318
imitating the curriculum program
of the Leaf's.

70
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,322
It seems that Temari and her brothers
are working as instructors.

71
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,866
Instructors?!

72
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,453
Is that harsh woman fit to be
something like an instructor...?

73
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,539
Really? That Gaara, huh...?

74
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,010
This is hands-on training.

75
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,180
Choose from among these
a Ninja tool that suits you.

76
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,433
What is it?

77
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,146
Do we absolutely have to choose?!

78
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,608
What do you mean?

79
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:02,112
We'll end up hurting the other person
if we use a weapon.

80
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,239
We might kill them.

81
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,492
A weapon is...

82
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,798
No, never mind...

83
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,346
A mission isn't a game.

84
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,141
If you were to enter a field of battle
with that frame of mind, you'd die.

85
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,185
I-I'm sorry.

86
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,438
You got Gaara angry because
you ask stupid questions.

87
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,815
You are in trouble.

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,365
The three of us will conduct
hands-on training.

89
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,534
Gather in the respective class
of your choice.

90
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,996
Gaara, put a smile on!

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,708
They'll get scared and nobody will
choose you with that sulky look.

92
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,506
My dad said that Gaara
was the Sand's ultimate weapon.

93
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,844
Yeah. He's so powerful that the village
would be destroyed, if he got mad.

94
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,888
He's scary, so let's not bother.

95
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,640
All right, I'm with Temari.

96
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,016
I'll be with Kankuro!

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,644
– Me too!
– Me too!

98
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,062
– Me too!
– Me too!

99
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,523
Please be my teacher.

100
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,075
Earlier, he was trying to
teach me something...

101
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,042
Excuse me... Please be my teacher.

102
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,838
Are you okay with me?

103
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,923
Please teach me!

104
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,305
This is cool.

105
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,265
That's too big!

106
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,766
I'll take this.

107
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,576
What's your name?

108
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,536
I'm Matsuri.

109
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,997
Matsuri, choose a weapon.

110
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,813
What's the matter?

111
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,449
Come at me with that weapon
with the intent to kill me.

112
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
Yes, sir...

113
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,415
They say an ogre with Iron Club
is invincible. But you are no ogre.

114
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,711
Yes, sir. Please tell me
what I should choose.

115
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,762
The weapon called the Rope Javelin.

116
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,055
Rope Javelin...

117
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,272
The sharp blade on the end of the rope

118
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:28,110
is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,
rather than for attack.

119
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,738
And you seal off an enemy's movement
with the rope.

120
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,037
Practice until you can control it
as a part of your body.

121
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,163
Yes, sir!

122
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,277
Damn. Who are you guys?!

123
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,870
Is this all
the Sand Village Shinobi have?

124
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,872
Wait.

125
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:26,084
Leave this guy alive.
We can use him to draw that one out.

126
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,095
Hang in there! What is it?!
What happened?

127
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,307
Take me to Gaara... Quickly.

128
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,048
What's the matter?

129
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,969
My mother and father were hit with
countless weapons right in front of me.

130
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,472
So I...

131
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,268
For what purpose
do you hold a weapon?

132
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,146
He...

133
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,149
What are...

134
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,570
...these two to you?!

135
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,492
Th-These guys are...

136
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,953
...my friends!

137
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,997
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!

138
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,375
I'll clobber you!

139
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,086
He said that to me.

140
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,097
That's what we're after: Gaara.

141
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,315
Gaara, we were
just coming to get you.

142
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,152
The patrol Ninja was
attacked by somebody.

143
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,863
Guys calling themselves
The Four Celestials

144
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,826
brandishing strange weapons,
said to tell Gaara that...

145
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:28,790
"We declare a challenge to you,
the ultimate weapon.

146
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,710
"If you don't accept the challenge,

147
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,715
"we will take away one person
close to you every day...

148
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,301
"and they shall
pay the price for you."

149
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,686
You there.

150
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,188
Are you Gaara's student?

151
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,611
You shall be the first sacrifice.

152
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,255
What's this Rope Javelin?!

153
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,507
Wait!

154
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,304
The enemy went northeast...

155
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,598
Matsuri has become a first sacrifice...

156
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,352
But the real target of the guys who
call themselves the Four Celestials is...

157
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,187
you, Gaara.

158
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,522
Yeah...

159
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,190
This must be brought to
a Jonin Council at once...

160
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,701
In the northeastern direction

161
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,871
where the ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials left,

162
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,165
there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,

163
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,334
with the Land of Rivers
sandwiched between.

164
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,129
Therefore, we will be requesting
the assistance of the Leaf...

165
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,092
Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.

166
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,761
Form a unit and prepare for
pursuit immediately.

167
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,223
Hold it.

168
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,475
The enemy is after Gaara.

169
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,478
That would be like walking
right into a trap they laid.

170
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,565
That's right.
Why won't you send a party?!

171
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,735
It might be a diversionary tactic
by the enemy.

172
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,655
The village will become shorthanded
if we send out pursuers.

173
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,075
Then you at least could
come with us, right, Baki?!

174
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,916
Most likely, the enemy is
after Shukaku.

175
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,003
Gaara is the Sand's ultimate weapon.

176
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,297
If we know that...

177
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,218
But it's also a dangerous
double-edged sword to the village.

178
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,680
If they would do us the favor
facing each other and perishing...

179
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,811
Then at least
I should go with them.

180
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,606
No. You have a different mission.

181
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,816
Just send those three!

182
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,825
Hey, how about it?!

183
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,495
I've been given
a different mission, you see...

184
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,081
Go. She's your student, right?

185
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,921
Let's go, Kankuro.

186
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,978
Will it be okay with her?!

187
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,189
She's just a kid.

188
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,483
Will he come?!

189
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:47,030
If he doesn't come, we'll just sacrifice
those close to him one after another.

190
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,118
That is...?

191
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,962
It's a message from the Sand Village!

192
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,466
Gaara? Why?

193
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,011
Who knows?
The goal is a challenge to Gaara.

194
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,098
The hostage is a Ninja school student.

195
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,227
The enemy is escaping in the direction of
the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.

196
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,398
Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are
chasing after them.

197
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,651
At this point, that's all we know.

198
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,321
You want me to set up an operation
to stop the overconfident jerks

199
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,866
who challenged Gaara
just with that information?

200
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,412
Yeah. We're on friendly terms
with the Sand Village, so.

201
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,081
Just a minute.

202
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:42,919
They came during the Sasuke incident
with much less information than now.

203
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,505
Things are more bothersome
than that time!

204
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,590
Our range would widen significantly
if we ambushed them

205
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,884
instead of pursuing them.

206
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,220
There's also the incident in question
in the Village of Artisans,

207
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,514
and the Jonin and Chunin
are all away...

208
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,725
– Shizune...
– Yes, ma'am!

209
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,937
Those are the only Genin
we can use now.

210
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,356
Take the Genin you want to use

211
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,693
and leave the village
within thirty minutes!

212
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,363
Sakura's name isn't on here.

213
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,700
Yeah. She's doing
Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.

214
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,371
I'll accept the mission.
But I have one condition.

215
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,249
Please let me borrow Sakura.

216
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,668
Sakura?

217
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,638
It's almost time!
Is this everyone, Shikamaru?!

218
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,474
One person still hasn't come.

219
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,225
Could that be...?

220
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,479
Sorry to keep you waiting!

221
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:48,067
I can't do a mission hungry.
So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.

222
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,737
What?! That's not fair just you
getting to eat! I'll also...

223
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,450
All right! Now we've got
all our members together! We're off!

224
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,620
Huh? What? This is it?!

225
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,705
I'd heard this was an operation
with a mobilization

226
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,457
of the Genin
remaining in the village!

227
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,334
This is everyone, I tell you!

228
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,044
That's messed up!

229
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,213
Setting aside Sakura who's training,

230
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,341
there should still be
Shino, Neji and Hinata!

231
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,886
No mistake. It's weird Akamaru and I
being the only Ninja

232
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,763
with search ability.

233
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,642
So is this team
a go-for-it super attack-type?

234
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,270
Yeah. I name us
Team Return the Favor.

235
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,482
What lame naming!

236
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:32,570
The guys from the Sand Village
helped us during the Sasuke incident!

237
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:36,157
In a manner, this operation will be
returning the favor from that time!

238
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,495
All right! Guys, let's make sure to
return the favor from that time.

239
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,956
You're not the leader!

240
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,668
Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader
of this platoon, right?!

241
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,253
That's right...

242
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,590
Jeez, then let's settle on a strategy
and get going as soon as possible.

243
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,426
Are we going in one line
as we did for the Sasuke incident?

244
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,265
There's no doubting the conditions
are similar to the Sasuke incident.

245
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,811
However, the strategies for pursuit
and ambush are completely different!

246
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,857
We can't follow them with Byakugan
or by using Akamaru's nose.

247
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,400
No mistake about that.

248
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,194
It's unconventional, but since these are
all the people we've got,

249
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,865
we'll act in groups of two basis
as Two-Man Cells.

250
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,617
Solo action is prohibited
no matter what the case!

251
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,745
We owe a debt to the Ninja in
the Sand Village.

252
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,917
However, although this is to repay a debt,
no way will we produce casualties!

253
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,712
Yeah, I got it.

254
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,303
– Follow me, Ino.
– Right!

255
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,388
Choji, you go with Kiba...

256
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,557
I'm counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.

257
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,683
Right...

258
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,185
Lee, you're with Naruto...

259
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,064
Right. Please refrain
from selfish actions.

260
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,358
You don't need to remind me like that.

261
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:57,071
Also, the four people Naruto mentioned
earlier have left before us.

262
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:01,284
Four people, do you mean
Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?

263
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,870
Yeah. The four will be
going their separate ways

264
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,872
and won't take part in future battles!

265
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,040
Why not?!

266
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,543
Isn't that an incredible waste
of battle strength?!

267
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,963
In place of that, we get a wider range
of search action...

268
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,801
And we'll have them focus on
medical action in the case of battle starting.

269
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:23,181
I have been entrusted with your lives
and this is my strategy!

270
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,094
All right, just wait, Gaara!

271
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,222
I'll make sure to return the favor!

272
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,061
The Key to the rusted heart's door

273
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:16,025
Will always be smiling right near by

274
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,536
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

275
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,124
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

276
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,628
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

277
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,633
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

278
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,054
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

279
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:50,059
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

280
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:54,147
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

281
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:01,237
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

282
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,867
The wind is probably testing our hearts

283
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,788
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

284
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:15,418
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

285
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,256
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

286
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,719
The Key to the rusted heart's door

287
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:30,641
Will always be smiling right near by

288
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:42,278
One of the enemies uses wind, huh?
Interesting. I will be her opponent!

289
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,616
Then I'll take on the guy who brandishes
the sword that looks like a kid's toy.

290
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,951
We'll take care of this.
You go ahead, Gaara.

291
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,162
But, will it be okay?

292
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,457
We don't need your help
to deal with these chumps.

293
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,377
You hurry, Gaara. That girl is
your student, isn't she?

294
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,380
Next time: "Sand Alliance
with The Leaf Shinobi"
