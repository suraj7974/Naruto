1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,146
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,567
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,904
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,414
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,587
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,219
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,603
Leaving nothing behind,

10
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

11
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

12
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,742
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

13
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

14
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

15
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,881
and melting away

16
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,143
Where's the other one?

17
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,228
Hey...

18
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,898
Who are you looking for?

19
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,655
I'll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.

20
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,913
This is my ability...
specializing in assassination, of course.

21
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:05,626
You can't beat me by just having
a good nose and nails...

22
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,671
You can't beat my ability!

23
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,934
Akamaru... I'm sorry...

24
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,771
Akamaru...
We've always done things together.

25
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,982
We were together
whenever and wherever.

26
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,570
However this one time, I'm sunk.

27
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,908
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,

28
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,536
and I can even create parts
that are only you.

29
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,622
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition...

30
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,041
a sharing of the flesh is what it'll be.

31
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,628
A sharing...?

32
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,046
That's right!

33
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,633
And a cruel way of killing
that only I can accomplish...

34
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,138
the gradual scraping off
of just your cells!

35
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,015
I see...

36
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,149
If that's the case...!

37
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,037
If I do this...
what's gonna happen?

38
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:28,292
Suicide?! That's ridiculous!

39
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,296
Die with me...

40
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,967
To Each His Own Battle

41
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,830
What are you thinking?!

42
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:21,178
It's just as I thought...
We are sharing one body, right?

43
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,471
Damn it!

44
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,768
Entering my opponent's body
to avoid any attacks...

45
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,604
that is my Jutsu's greatest advantage.

46
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,273
There hasn't been
a single one before now

47
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,858
who's done this sort of thing.

48
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,611
Are you in pain?

49
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,365
All right then, let's get comfortable now.

50
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,078
Yikes, you idiot!
Stop it!

51
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,538
It's too late!

52
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,598
There's not enough blood...

53
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,495
Damn!

54
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:32,958
Damn...

55
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,961
Where'd he go?

56
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,436
So he left his little dog behind
and fled.

57
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,983
It's the right decision,
but he's more cold-hearted than me.

58
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,747
What?!
It couldn't be!

59
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,355
What a relief...
He's still breathing.

60
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,860
What a relief!

61
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,130
Akamaru... You really gave it your best.

62
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,467
Because of you, I was able to hold up
the enemy for a while.

63
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,761
We've caused injuries
upon the enemy too.

64
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:13,392
It's enough... You've done enough.

65
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,454
-His name is Akamaru.
-Huh?

66
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,708
Mom... Sis...

67
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,171
From today, you'll take care of him...
Okay?

68
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,256
I will?

69
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,526
I'm Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.

70
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,162
You!

71
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,052
We've been together forever.

72
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,891
Nice catch, Akamaru!

73
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,021
All right, you did well!

74
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,232
Here we go!

75
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,784
Be more serious about it!

76
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,331
Stop being such a baby!

77
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,499
Mom...

78
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,758
Listen, Kiba...

79
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,927
It's not just you.

80
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,428
Akamaru and you,

81
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,389
the two of you need
to become strong together.

82
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,893
With Akamaru... Together?

83
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,690
Akamaru...

84
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,326
That's right.

85
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,292
Way to go Akamaru! You did it!

86
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,877
Mid-air Dynamic Marking!

87
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,340
Next is mid-air triple somersault!
Take your aim!

88
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,016
Yahoo!

89
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,314
Yahoo!

90
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,706
We'll be together forever
from now on too...

91
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,918
I'll protect you from now on!

92
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,761
That jerk!

93
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,348
Setting up a trap on me!

94
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,196
I'll kill you!

95
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,203
Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!

96
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,380
Sakon!

97
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,841
Sakon!

98
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,139
Blah blah blah.
You're such a nuisance, Big Brother.

99
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,934
Your yelling stings my eyes...

100
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,728
Big Brother!

101
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,106
I'll kill him... is what I'd like to do,

102
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,149
but it's almost time for my sleep.

103
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,903
Capture those bastards alive in my place.

104
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,240
When I wake up,
I'll kill them.

105
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,326
All right, Sakon?
Capture them alive...

106
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,871
Yeah, I got it...
But...

107
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,208
The killing part,
we'll do it together.

108
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,199
If I carelessly attack,

109
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,535
he dodges
and I end up attacking myself!

110
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,984
Behold!

111
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,152
Willow Dance!

112
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,346
You!

113
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,740
Bones?

114
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,836
This is my...Kekkei Genkai.

115
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,825
What's with this guy...?

116
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,495
Is he attacking with bones sticking out
from all over his body?

117
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,743
He's grabbed his own bone!

118
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,298
It'll be soon...

119
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:30,305
He's turning the bone...
into a sword!

120
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,817
It's futile. It's not just ordinary bone.

121
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:48,239
The highest density bone is hard as steel.

122
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,702
So what?! I'll break that bone!

123
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,206
I possess Five Dances.

124
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:03,296
You'd better not think
you know my strength after just this much.

125
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,381
What?!

126
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,928
I'll specially show you...

127
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,348
the Camellia Dance next .

128
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,726
Come!

129
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,145
I'll crush you!

130
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,033
I did it!

131
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,285
It's a Substitution?!

132
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,918
There!

133
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,670
Damn!

134
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,225
They're getting closer and closer.

135
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,645
Damn!

136
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,240
This isn't good, traces of blood!

137
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:17,579
Damn, I did save Akamaru
for the time being,

138
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,748
but maybe I went too far.

139
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,271
This smell...
What does it mean?

140
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,943
Why... Why is it that even those guys
are headed to a place like this?!

141
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,738
I don't understand anymore.

142
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,824
In any case,
we need to leave this place quickly.

143
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,205
I can't...

144
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,416
I'm starting to feel light-headed
from the pain and loss of blood...

145
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,711
My body won't move at all either...

146
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,176
Akamaru...

147
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,045
He left just his coat...

148
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,215
Huh?

149
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,931
So he fled by floating down the river...

150
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,975
Damn!

151
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,898
Damn!

152
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,949
Damn...

153
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,034
This is it!

154
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,789
So, I've cornered you, you stinking rat!

155
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,003
Pretty impressive...

156
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,757
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.

157
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,302
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?

158
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,930
Since it's a pretty complicated song...

159
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,600
Well now...

160
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,810
Not only did you
immediately understand

161
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,980
that I'm manipulating these guys
with my flute,

162
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:53,276
you understood how difficult this song is.
You're a pretty impressive punk.

163
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,406
But you can't completely
understand this song.

164
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:04,329
You're so right...
since art is so foreign to me.

165
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,000
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,

166
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,171
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns

167
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,841
to control each and every movement
of those guys.

168
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:21,262
I'm pretty confident
when it comes to just analyzing,

169
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,306
but this time it's not looking good.

170
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,144
The reason is that

171
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,856
I don't understand
musical notes whatsoever.

172
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,693
There's no one that's heard
this song and lived.

173
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,864
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!

174
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,837
The melody's changed!

175
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,314
For the first time, I spoke to you

176
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,484
And you smiled

177
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,861
For the first time, I was able to speak

178
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,864
In my own words

179
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,453
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

180
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:32,750
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

181
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,756
My clumsy attempts with words

182
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,345
You listened without turning away

183
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

184
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:55,606
But you don't feel anything for me,

185
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,942
do you?

186
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,737
I feel so sad

187
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,863
But...

188
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,115
For the first time, I spoke to you

189
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,452
And you smiled

190
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,746
For the first time, I was able to speak

191
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,082
In my own words

192
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,418
For the first time, I spoke to you

193
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,755
And you smiled

194
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,007
For the first time, I was able to speak

195
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,260
In my own words

196
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,057
For the first time, I spoke to you

197
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,985
Attacks and defense without gaps
using three Summoned bodies.

198
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,572
I hate to admit, but she may
be a pretty good Shogi player.

199
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,700
Plus I don't have much Ninja tools left...

200
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,828
Man, it feels like I'm playing
without rooks or bishops.

201
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,789
Now then...shall I go?

202
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:57,376
Cry or laugh,
I can only give it my all here!

203
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,631
Next time,
"Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!"
