1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,649
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,336
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,006
Now

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,896
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,492
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:20,247
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,135
And the next match.

20
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,640
This year's rookie looks challenging...

21
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,105
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka

22
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,733
It's here, it's here, it's here!

23
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,860
What we've been waiting for!

24
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,071
It's finally my turn!

25
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,657
Yeah! Lucky us!

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,618
If it's this guy,
we'll absolutely win, Akamaru!

27
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,958
Show us how much you've grown.

28
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,213
I'm going to do it!

29
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,426
Akamaru Unleashed! Who's Top Dog Now?

30
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,934
The seventh battle,
Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.

31
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,866
I got sick of waiting!

32
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,202
It's finally time for me to shine!
Believe it!

33
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,122
That's my line!

34
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,291
With you as my opponent,
I've as good as won!

35
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,792
Right, Akamaru?

36
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,754
Don't get excited!

37
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,382
You won't be able to beat me!

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,758
Why you little...!

39
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,596
Hey! Don't bring your puppy!

40
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,222
He'll get in the way of the match!

41
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,515
You fool!

42
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,684
Akamaru's going to fight with me.

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,187
Hey, hey! Is that okay?

44
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,355
Yes.

45
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,692
Animals and insects are treated
the same as ninja tools.

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,111
There's no problem.

47
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,740
Well, that's fine!

48
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,742
It's a perfect handicap!

49
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,244
Talking tough!

50
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,454
Then...

51
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,916
Akamaru, don't put a paw in this.

52
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,500
I'll fight him by myself!

53
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,212
Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like this!

54
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,924
It's finally come.

55
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,596
Naruto, huh?

56
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,849
I'm sorry, but he can't beat Kiba...

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,435
Kakashi.

58
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,603
Naruto...

59
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,688
I-I want to support you, but...

60
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,900
Kiba's on my team...

61
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,196
Kiba will get mad...

62
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,031
But...

63
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,286
Naruto...

64
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,873
Kiba's lucky.

65
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,632
I don't know how strong he's become
since this guy became a Genin...

66
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,176
Today we'll run through Transformation Jutsu.

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,011
You'll change yourself into Lord Hokage...

68
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,431
His ability was "that," so...

69
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,646
Transform!

70
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,074
So noisy...

71
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,034
I was sleeping comfortably...

72
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,915
T-That was a joke! I-I did it on purpose!

73
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,917
Enough, Naruto!

74
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,836
It's your third year at the academy!

75
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,504
Wha...?

76
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,382
Goodness sake, who is that guy?

77
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,428
We've just switched to this class
and already found someone funny.

78
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,847
That guy, he's on a roll.

79
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,350
He's an attention-seeker, huh?

80
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,561
One more time, fool!

81
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,521
Transform!

82
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,906
You...

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,075
Is it possible...?

84
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,502
Hey hey, are you serious?

85
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,089
You've been here for three years and can't
even do a respectable transformation?

86
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,552
All of you watch now!

87
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,057
I will absolutely someday become
the true and a real Hokage!

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,477
Lame!

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,728
What Hokage?!

90
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,988
Some sympathy at the very least...

91
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,407
I'll do you in, in one clean blow!

92
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:10,871
Really? But you can't beat me!

93
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,916
I said not to act tough.

94
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,384
Well then. Please begin!

95
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,972
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All-Four Jutsu!

96
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,688
Here I come!

97
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,819
Fast!

98
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,584
It will be a while 'til
he opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.

99
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,503
Just as I thought.

100
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,506
That Naruto can't be equal to Kiba.

101
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,091
Naruto...

102
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,801
That was too embarrassing to watch.

103
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,471
See...

104
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,142
What was that? That guy is weak.

105
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,897
Naruto!

106
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:21,984
Huh?

107
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,866
Yes, that's it...

108
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,626
I'll surpass Hokage!

109
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,132
Then everyone in the village will
acknowledge my existence!

110
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,384
Those are his words...

111
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,095
I've always made fun of them, too.

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,853
This is the Jonin...a true Ninja...

113
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,396
I have to escape...

114
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,772
If I stay like this...

115
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,777
I'll really, really be killed!

116
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,905
Are you hurt...

117
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,991
Scaredy cat?

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,037
You just need to become stronger than me!

119
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,174
Darn you!

120
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,135
You!

121
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,470
What are you doing all of a sudden?!

122
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,937
T-This stupid coward is...

123
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,441
absolutely...not the Sasuke I know!

124
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,235
Don't mess with me!

125
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,908
W-What?

126
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,870
But, it was wrong!

127
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,670
Hey...

128
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,256
are you hurt?

129
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,884
Scaredy cat?

130
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:26,692
I won't change my words,
that's my way of Ninja!

131
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,623
Naruto...

132
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,667
Say it to everyone!

133
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,336
Don't...

134
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,256
Don't...

135
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,841
underestimate me!

136
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,054
Yeah!

137
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,516
He seems to have grown to say such thing.

138
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,476
Naruto...!

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,478
Go, Naruto!

140
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,189
What are you talking about,
bleeding like that?

141
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,442
Your tough talk has gone too far!

142
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:13,155
I didn't use my power fully...
to observe your strength first!

143
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,660
You too, cut out the tough talk
and use the dog or whatever you want!

144
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,039
You'll regret this...

145
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,458
Let's go Akamaru!

146
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,214
Smoke Ball?

147
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,549
Take this!

148
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,198
I can't see! This is bad!

149
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,159
I have to get out of the smoke...
or I'll be done for.

150
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,580
It worked!

151
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,377
What is it...?

152
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,004
Shoot...I can't see anything.

153
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,855
Yeah! We did it!

154
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,901
Yay! Good job, Akama...!

155
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,206
A-Akamaru...

156
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,541
Why?

157
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,636
Why?

158
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,472
You took the bait!

159
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,185
Y-You!

160
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,270
Transform Jutsu?!

161
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,231
Ouch! Shoot!
Let go!

162
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,444
You smell like a dog!

163
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,196
W-Where's Akamaru?!

164
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,281
Over here!

165
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,909
Akamaru! Darn!

166
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,245
No way!

167
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,955
That's Naruto?!

168
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,832
An equal match with Kiba...

169
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,876
No, it may be more than equal!

170
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,005
Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu
to Transform Jutsu, that's a clever trick.

171
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,924
Naruto shouldn't be able to do that...

172
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,844
His timing at using Jutsu's is very good.

173
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,014
What? He's better than I thought.

174
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,644
But, to get mad like that after
biting the opponent himself...

175
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,354
What a funny guy.

176
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,149
N-Naruto...amazing!

177
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,318
That's amazing, Naruto!

178
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,576
You got a little bit stronger.

179
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,078
But it's over.

180
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,538
Next, I'll attack you seriously.

181
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,457
Oh really?!

182
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,002
But you will absolutely not beat me!

183
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,923
During this exam, he's matured again.

184
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,968
This is a surprise...

185
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,931
That's Naruto, the perpetual goof...?

186
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,143
Evidently it's no longer "that" Naruto.

187
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,269
Yeah.

188
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,732
I wonder, what kind
of trick Kakashi used...?

189
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,109
Still...

190
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,410
Huh?

191
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,004
As for the development of
my Kiba and Akamaru,

192
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,215
it's probably more than Naruto.

193
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,388
Naruto...I'll take Akamaru...back!

194
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,740
W-What's this?!

195
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,327
What did you feed him? His fur turned red!

196
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,581
That's why he's called "Akamaru", red boy.

197
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,375
Food Pills huh...?

198
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,919
That Kiba...

199
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,046
He intends to end it with this.

200
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,881
Here we go, Akamaru!

201
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,968
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry...!

202
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,398
Man Beast Clones!

203
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,070
T-There's something wrong with their eyes!

204
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,031
He's using some weird drug!

205
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,825
Isn't this doping? Is this okay?!

206
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,662
Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.

207
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,999
You, that's all you say!

208
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,709
What?!

209
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,919
What did that guy eat?

210
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,463
It's Food Pills.

211
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,256
F-Food Pills?

212
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,468
Food Pills are a secret medicine
that people in the military take

213
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:31,056
and fight for three days and
three nights without a break...

214
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,058
They're high in protein,
easily absorbed and

215
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,021
have some types of component
that influence agitation or sedation...

216
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:45,779
Kiba and Akamaru's Chakra must
be doubled right now...

217
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,614
It's over with this...

218
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,949
Let's go! All-Four...

219
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,661
Jutsu!

220
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,266
N-Naruto!

221
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,688
That Naruto is in danger!

222
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,400
Kiba's the gung-ho fighter type
who will attack

223
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,112
like a beast with Chakra wired
throughout his body.

224
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,989
And the Food Pills that double one's
Chakra are quite simply...

225
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,702
the perfect pill for Kiba.

226
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,705
Naruto...

227
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,876
This isn't good...
There's no way to counterattack...

228
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,379
All I can do is gather all
the Chakra in my legs

229
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,214
and do my best to escape...!

230
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,298
At this rate...

231
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,680
Here's my chance!

232
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,724
Take this!

233
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,726
Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!

234
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,398
Fang Over Fang!

235
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,875
This is the difference in our true powers.

236
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,093
I'm going...

237
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,637
to become the Hokage.

238
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,766
I can't lose here...!

239
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,226
You? Hokage?!

240
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,520
When you're weaker than me?

241
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,484
I'll become Hokage for you!

242
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:05,001
You know deep down inside
that you can't become the Hokage.

243
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,628
So quit acting tough!

244
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,718
You're wrong, Kiba...

245
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,180
Naruto...

246
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,808
He's not that weak...

247
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:26,648
I'll receive the name... of Lord Hokage!

248
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,028
All of you, just watch!

249
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,032
Naruto, unlike me...

250
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,660
he has always believed in his own worth.

251
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,007
I thought it was really amazing...

252
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,261
It must have been really hard...

253
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,187
I understand that.

254
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,191
And yet before not even one person...

255
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,490
tried to see Naruto.

256
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,998
Hey, that's the kid...

257
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,043
I heard he's the only one... who failed.

258
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,462
Serves him right!

259
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,507
It's trouble if a kid like that
becomes a Ninja.

260
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,925
After all, that kid is really...

261
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,803
Stop! Anything further is taboo.

262
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,559
Nobody tried to acknowledge real Naruto.

263
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,735
Clone Jutsu!

264
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,458
But now...

265
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,463
Everyone's watching...

266
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,889
Stand up! Naruto!

267
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,980
Everyone is acknowledging him!

268
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,957
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage...

269
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,712
You...will be the loser!

270
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,228
Hey, can you hear it?

271
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:17,318
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

272
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,536
The ocean spans limitlessly

273
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:35,753
Please keep that smile on your face forever

274
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,219
Or else I'll cry

275
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,390
You won't have to search around you

276
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,269
It's all ok now.

277
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,899
Everyone

278
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,111
is inside this hand

279
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:05,324
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

280
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,912
When you forget what happiness is

281
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,916
Just sing.

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Light is born, and darkness was born

283
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

284
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,056
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

285
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,311
Hey, can you hear it?

286
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,109
That Kiba, he sure is stupid.

287
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,903
Think hard about your Jutsu
when you use them.

288
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,323
Otherwise, your opponents
will take advantage of the Jutsu.

289
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:49,077
Well, the outcome of you and me
could be seen from the beginning.

290
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,537
The way you've torn me apart up until now,

291
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,332
I'll give it back all at once!

292
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,795
Next episode: "Surprise Attack!
Naruto's Secret Weapon!"

293
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,506
This is the trick I've been saving up!
