1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:12,012
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,743
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,495
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,999
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,420
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,329
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,929
What do you mean by
monitoring Akamaru?

17
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,598
You know about the incident

18
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,227
where someone from outside
infiltrated the village, right?

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,728
Yeah, I know about that.

20
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,857
But I heard that Kiba and the others
resolved that incident without any trouble.

21
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:51,362
That's right.
Damn! That Kiba!

22
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,825
I want a mission where
I totally kick an enemy's butt.

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,701
To be exact, that's wrong.

24
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,036
What?

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,622
Before Kiba and the others
had the intruder in custody...

26
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,833
he swallowed a pellet
and killed himself.

27
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,876
What? Suicide...?

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,002
In the investigation that followed,

29
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,296
it was revealed that the enemy
was a Shinobi

30
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,590
from another land that uses
a unique tactic.

31
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:17,721
Perhaps he took his own life
in order to seal that power.

32
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,643
What's the "unique" tactic?

33
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,647
Something you would call
a biological weapon.

34
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,066
Biological weapon?

35
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,363
It's a particular pathogen...

36
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,700
a terrible weapon where someone
infected will gradually lose oneself

37
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,995
and have their body taken over.

38
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,874
But how is that connected
with monitoring Akamaru?

39
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,669
Could it be that Akamaru was...?!

40
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,634
There's a possibility he's infected.

41
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,690
He still doesn't look so well.

42
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,984
Y-Yeah...

43
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,778
Since Akamaru's not
in his best condition,

44
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm skipping training today as well.

45
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,616
Okay...

46
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:25,998
Oh!

47
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,505
Wh-What're you doing, Shino?!

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,054
Shino, do something quick!

49
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,268
Shino!

50
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,447
The insects suddenly
stopped listening to me.

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,950
Jeez, give me a break.

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,409
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,957
We'll head back early
for the time being. See ya.

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,544
I hope... Akamaru gets better soon.

55
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,880
Shino?

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,344
It's the first time the insects
have attacked a comrade...

57
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,311
What is it, Akamaru?

58
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,983
Oh, shoot! I've been spotted!

59
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,529
What're you doing, Naruto?

60
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,364
Wh-What, you ask?

61
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,035
I'm developing a new Jutsu,
believe it!

62
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,871
So as for me, I'm busy and...

63
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:59,383
Kiba's Long Day

64
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,108
Is there no mistake, Sis?

65
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,695
I'd say the possibility
at this point is around fifty-fifty.

66
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,450
I still haven't been able to identify it,

67
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,120
but these are the lab results of
the blood drawn from Akamaru...

68
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,457
But! It could be some kind of mistake!

69
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,837
Do you think I, a veterinarian,
would make such a mistake?

70
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,632
Yeah... You're right.

71
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,472
What is it, Akamaru?!

72
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,562
Let go! Let go!

73
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,732
Akamaru, it's Naruto. It's okay to let go.

74
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,445
Hey, Akamaru!

75
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,906
Akamaru!

76
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,369
What did you do that for Akamaru?

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,626
I mean, what're you doing
in the front yard of my house?

78
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,088
Huh? Well, that's...

79
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,048
Anyway, come in.

80
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,551
For the time being, I have to fulfill
my responsibility as the owner.

81
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,636
What?

82
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,138
What?!

83
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:34,937
Geez! Biting a comrade
of the same village can't be allowed!

84
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,189
Are you training him properly, Kiba?!

85
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,031
All right. It's finished! Perfect if
I do say so myself!

86
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:57,543
Sis! That looks just like
a surgical scar!

87
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,630
What? Really?
I thought it turned out well, though...

88
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,715
Sorry, Naruto.

89
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,801
Have Sakura or someone
patch them up for you!

90
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,136
Hm? Right...

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,055
See ya.
Right.

92
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,850
See you later too, Miss Hana!

93
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,152
Akamaru...

94
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,364
I'm telling you,

95
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,325
there's nothing else other than
my pants getting all torn up.

96
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,831
Shino's insects attacked Akamaru...

97
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,792
He even attacked Naruto, whom
he should know very well.

98
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,548
There's trouble, Lady Tsunade!

99
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,310
It seems they were attacked
by someone

100
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,270
in the middle of night training.

101
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,482
Looks like they launched
a sneak attack with quite a few men.

102
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,068
No, it seems there was just one culprit.

103
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,446
What?! All of this by one person?!

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,073
To be precise, that's not correct.

105
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,704
It's one animal.

106
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,166
There's no doubt.

107
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,544
There's trouble, Kiba!

108
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,879
You're talking about the incident

109
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,256
where Shinobi were attacked during
night training last night, right...?

110
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,175
It-It can't be!

111
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,054
It seems it's as you said, Sis...

112
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,889
I can smell blood from Akamaru.

113
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,782
That's Kiba Inuzuka's
Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?

114
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,077
You jerks.
What do you want with Akamaru?!

115
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,455
A warrant...?

116
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,790
Kiba...!

117
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,875
Yes, there's no mistake.

118
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,337
Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,714
the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept

120
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,217
under the supervision
of the Anbu Black Ops.

121
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,807
– Damn it!
– Kiba!

122
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,811
We should obey
the Lady Hokage's order.

123
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,451
Damn it!

124
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,787
Akamaru...

125
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,293
Here.

126
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,838
Thanks, Sis.

127
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,341
This contains medicine that I prepared,

128
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,719
so give it to the vet over there.

129
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,096
Right. I'm off, then.

130
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,329
Naruto...?

131
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,334
What's the idea of Akamaru
being detained?!

132
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,920
Akamaru is the culprit from
last night's incident.

133
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,797
We have sufficient proof as well.

134
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,300
At this point, it's an unavoidable measure.

135
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:38,680
The Medical Team is now desperately
looking for a way to save Akamaru.

136
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,766
Don't worry too much.

137
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,895
If...that doesn't work either,
what'll happen to Akamaru?

138
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,106
At that time...

139
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,901
there'll be nothing left to do
but to put Akamaru down!

140
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,111
Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital

141
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,781
You don't need to worry.

142
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,699
The Medical Corps will figure
something out soon.

143
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,117
Right...

144
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,161
Take care on your way home.

145
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,704
Right.

146
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,751
Akamaru...

147
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,130
I won't hand you over to anyone.

148
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,762
It seems Kiba Inuzuka
has taken Akamaru and fled.

149
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,099
Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?

150
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,351
In preparation for the worst,

151
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,770
have the Special Pursuit Corps
stand by here!

152
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,814
The Special Pursuit Corps...

153
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:33,026
C-Could it be that you're really
going to kill Akamaru...Grandma?

154
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,947
Grandma Tsunade!

155
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,575
It's hard for me, too.

156
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,623
Damn it!

157
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,504
Did you find them?!
No!

158
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,173
Kiba!

159
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,175
Kiba!

160
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,145
He's rapidly getting worse.

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,981
Akamaru!

162
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,734
Where are they?
They should be around here.

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,120
I swore to protect him,
no matter what!

164
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:31,001
I swore never I'd never let him go through
that experience ever again...!

165
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,053
The Special Pursuit Corps
has assembled.

166
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,514
Show the team in.

167
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,107
Kiba! Where are you?!

168
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,961
I guess I was able to hide
my tracks somewhat...

169
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,471
This is a serum for Akamaru
that the Medical Corps whipped up.

170
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,681
I can't guarantee the level of effect.

171
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:31,353
There's maybe a fifty-percent chance
of survival.

172
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,271
There's also a risk of side-effects

173
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,815
that would cause Akamaru
to go even more berserk.

174
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,235
In the event that happens...

175
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,364
It's an unavoidable measure,
but Akamaru must...

176
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,408
Reporting!

177
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:50,622
The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has
lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.

178
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,873
Lady Tsunade.

179
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,516
That way?!

180
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,518
Akamaru...

181
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,936
Kiba!

182
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,863
Wh-What's that?

183
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,448
It's Akamaru...

184
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,908
But...

185
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,413
I won't hand over Akamaru to anyone!

186
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,914
What're you doing?!

187
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,458
Have you come to kill Akamaru?!

188
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,253
No! I just came out of concern!

189
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,173
You lie! The Lady Hokage said it,
didn't she?!

190
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,843
There'll be nothing else to do
but to kill Akamaru.

191
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,350
You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!

192
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,979
I won't hand over Akamaru
to anyone!

193
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,940
This isn't the time
to be doing that!

194
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,652
Something called the Special Pursuit Corps
or whatever is coming after Akamaru!

195
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,945
What?!

196
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,662
The Pursuit Corps should
be here soon.

197
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,957
Akamaru will really be
in trouble if that happens!

198
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,836
You and I have to do
something before that!

199
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,464
This isn't the time to be fighting!

200
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,386
Shut up!

201
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,270
Why don't you get it, Kiba?!

202
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,772
Shut up!

203
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,442
All right! I've sighted Akamaru!

204
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,702
Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!

205
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,081
C-Could it be...the Pursuit Corps is...

206
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
Sis!

207
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,924
You gotta be... joking, right?

208
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,884
Sis!

209
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,346
What're you going to do
to Akamaru with that?

210
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,724
This is medicine I received
from the Hokage.

211
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm going to inject it into Akamaru.

212
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,522
Then Akamaru will be saved?!

213
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,941
The probability is fifty-fifty.

214
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,279
If it fails and side-effects are produced,

215
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,615
Akamaru's symptoms will
get even worse.

216
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,576
All we can do now is take
a chance on this.

217
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,205
If the worst happens and it fails...

218
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,499
You understand, right, Kiba?

219
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,668
Damn it...

220
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,211
Even if it's only fifty percent,

221
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,880
there's a possibility that Akamaru
will be saved.

222
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:50,009
We've gotta do this!
I'll also help out, miss!

223
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,180
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

224
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,476
Kiba, what about you?!

225
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,771
If you're not going to do anything,
you're in the way, so beat it!

226
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,482
Let's go, Kiba.

227
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,950
Just leave that coward be.

228
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,411
You're ready, right?
Let's go, Naruto!

229
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,038
We'll save you now, Akamaru!

230
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,626
Aim for the legs!
Immobilize Akamaru!

231
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,711
Right!

232
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,988
Since it's come to this,
I have no choice.

233
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,991
I must terminate Akamaru.

234
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,493
Stop!

235
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,039
I said stop... Akamaru.

236
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,958
Kiba!
Kiba?

237
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,880
Akamaru...

238
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,556
Have you forgotten...my scent?

239
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:27,357
We were always together from
when we were little, weren't we?

240
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,996
Akamaru...

241
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:48,294
Why...why...did you become like this?

242
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,967
Please remember... Akamaru!

243
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,637
Kiba!

244
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,974
I'm sorry, Akamaru...

245
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,603
I put you through nothing but
painful experiences.

246
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:13,069
I'm sorry, Akamaru...
I couldn't protect you...

247
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,784
I'm sorry... Akamaru...

248
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,249
I'm a terrible master. But...

249
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,716
I'll...always be with you.

250
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,035
Kiba...

251
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,083
Kiba!

252
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,214
It really would've been touch and go

253
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,966
if the Medical Corps had been
even a little late in arriving.

254
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,927
Without a doubt,

255
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,765
he would've lost his life if Akamaru's attack
had hit Kiba's vital spot...

256
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,645
Really, it could have been
much worse.

257
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:30,688
That's wrong...

258
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,148
Huh? Kiba?!

259
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,778
When he came at me with
his final attack,

260
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,323
Akamaru just barely missed
my vital spots.

261
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:47,789
He drained all his remaining strength
in order to desperately control himself.

262
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,002
Akamaru was battling desperately
with himself.

263
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,964
That's admirable, Akamaru!

264
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,425
Thanks...

265
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,302
Akamaru.

266
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:16,359
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

267
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:23,282
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

268
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,464
Yellow Moon.

269
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:45,304
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

270
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:50,727
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

271
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,483
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

272
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:04,490
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

273
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:11,080
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

274
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:18,046
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

275
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:24,969
A magical chord change, in a restless city

276
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:31,809
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

277
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,319
In this world, there remain mysteries
yet unsolved.

278
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,449
We came to the Hidden Leaf Village
in search of mystery

279
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,410
and encountered a succession
of hair-raising terror.

280
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,662
However, we charge forward
without being daunted

281
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,372
by the forest that bares its fangs.

282
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,791
And then at last...!

283
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,084
We witness with our own eyes,

284
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,170
the creature of the legend handed down
from generation to generation.

285
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:03,424
Next time:
"A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:
The Onbaa!
