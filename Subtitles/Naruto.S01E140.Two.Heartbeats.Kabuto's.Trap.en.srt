1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,507
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,054
Two Heartbeats:
Kabuto's Trap

22
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,599
Huh?!

23
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,438
It can't be!

24
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,277
Even if you put up a bluff
I can foresee ...

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,615
that you are already...finished.

26
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,011
Poor thing.

27
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,015
This child is trembling
like a puppy

28
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,726
Now, Kabuto...

29
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,896
Get rid of her,
but don't make her suffer.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,981
I understand.

31
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,904
Sasuke...

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,659
I-I'll do anything for you!

33
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,538
So I'm begging you...
Please stay here!

34
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,794
You are really annoying.

35
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,754
Please don't go!

36
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,802
Sakura...

37
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,389
Thank you...

38
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,771
Sasuke...

39
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,069
Wait!
Hmm?

40
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,032
Did you...say something?

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,491
Wait!

42
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,581
Where's Sasuke!
Where is Sasuke?

43
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,918
It couldn't be that...
your body is already Sasuke's...?

44
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,755
There's no need to keep it
a secret any longer.

45
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:38,260
It's all right, Kabuto,
go on and tell her.

46
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,021
He was a little late
in getting here.

47
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,566
Lord Orochimaru wasn't able to
wait for Sasuke,

48
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,361
and already had been reincarnated
into another vessel.

49
00:03:55,861 --> 00:04:00,074
So Sasuke is all right?!
Somewhere in this building...

50
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,411
Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke
the Curse Mark,

51
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,831
so he could wait for
the next opportunity to reincarnate.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,625
But...

53
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,129
Not all humans can
tolerate Curse Marks.

54
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,939
No way, there's no way
that Sasuke could be...

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,318
That's right, Sasuke wasn't able
to tolerate the Curse Mark

56
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,444
and so he died.

57
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,447
That's a lie.

58
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,908
It has to be a lie!

59
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,998
What would telling a lie
like that accomplish?

60
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,876
To someone that's going to die...
As you are?

61
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,172
If you want to see him that badly
I'll let you see him.

62
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,508
When you die, you can see him
in the other world.

63
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,413
Sasuke...

64
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,500
Sakura!

65
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,672
Sakura, don't you believe...

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,550
what a guy like him says!

67
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,634
Naruto!

68
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,514
So it's Naruto, I thought you'd drowned
and died a long time ago but...

69
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,517
When I make a promise
I don't give up.

70
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,436
That's my Way of Ninja!

71
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,023
I ain't gonna die,
until I get Sasuke back!

72
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,484
This is interesting!

73
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,573
Sakura, go hide!

74
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,161
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,541
I'm over here!

76
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,670
Hey stupid, over here!
Over here, over here!

77
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,466
Where're you looking?
I'm over here! Over here!

78
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,094
What're you doing? Hey!

79
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,025
So you've used up all
your Kunai Knives...

80
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,614
I'm gonna...completely blow you away!

81
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,800
How annoying!

82
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,387
Fire Style:
Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!

83
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,770
– Ouch!
– That's hot!

84
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,733
– Yikes!
– Oww!

85
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,038
You're too slow!

86
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,498
Rasengan!

87
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,847
Naruto!

88
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,772
Since you and Orochimaru are here,

89
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,482
it means Sasuke is probably here too!

90
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,944
Tell us the truth right now!

91
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:16,038
Wh-What the heck?
My body won't move...

92
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,544
Have a good look at yourself.

93
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,007
Wh-What's this?

94
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,468
Those are Chakra Threads.

95
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,261
Chakra Threads?

96
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,724
While you were attacking earlier,

97
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,685
I wrapped the thread around you.

98
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:45,150
Take a good look at where
that thread is connected.

99
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,989
That's right.

100
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,617
Those Chakra Threads are...

101
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,205
connected to my heart's
Chakra Network.

102
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,335
And Naruto, the thread that's
wrapped around you

103
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:09,132
is connected through my Chakra Network
to your organs and to your heart.

104
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,472
See, can you hear that?

105
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:21,270
My heart and your heart will
eventually become connected as one!

106
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,856
– Damn!
– Naruto!

107
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:31,029
It's no use. That thread is formulated
and spun with Chakra

108
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,948
and it will absolutely not break.

109
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,457
Now our hearts are
completely synchronized...

110
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,628
The Chakra which passes
through this thread

111
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:51,842
via the Chakra Network from my heart
is controlling your heart ,you see.

112
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,804
It's no use, even though
it's my heart...

113
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:01,268
If my heart beat gets faster,
your heart will get faster too...

114
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,396
And when my heart stops beating...

115
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,733
you will die too!

116
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,904
Don't! If you stop your heart,
you'll die too!

117
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,909
That's right.
But that doesn't mean much.

118
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:22,164
Since I've already promised
my body to Lord Orochimaru...

119
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,938
Wh-What the heck are
you gonna do?!

120
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,443
If I crush this heart...

121
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,989
you will die too!

122
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,871
If I crush this heart...

123
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,959
you will die too!

124
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,836
Now, together we will...

125
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,382
Naruto!

126
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:18,095
How's it feel to have
your heart seized?

127
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,471
It'll be all right...

128
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,265
You'll be out of your misery
right away!

129
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,065
Stop it!

130
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:36,071
How foolish, if you kill me
Naruto will die too.

131
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,031
What I'm gonna cut...

132
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,491
is this!

133
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,289
There's no use you know,

134
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:51,086
It's impossible to cut thread formulated
and made from Chakra.

135
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,554
Even Lady Tsunade's great strength
wouldn't be able to break it.

136
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,148
What should I...
What should I do?!

137
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,942
Naruto is suffering right
in front of my eyes and yet...

138
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,070
I can't do anything!

139
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,450
Sakura...!

140
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,455
I...absolutely will not lose!

141
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,625
Until I've fulfilled my promise!

142
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,213
You bravado ends there.

143
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,259
Now, shall we die together?

144
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,471
And go to the place where
Sasuke is waiting?

145
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,410
Naruto!

146
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,205
Sakura!

147
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,166
– Sasame?!
– Sakura...

148
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,503
Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!

149
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,102
Naruto!

150
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,565
Naruto!

151
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,530
Naruto?!
Hey, are you okay? Naruto!

152
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,074
No way...

153
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,535
It can't be...

154
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,411
No way!

155
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,540
Naruto!

156
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,475
Ahh... My chest right now
is beating with joy.

157
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,438
Idiot! It was a waste for me
to have worried!

158
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,108
Sorry, Sakura...

159
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,943
You're so worthless!

160
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,825
That's right, Sasame!
Why are you here?

161
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,910
Well, it's...

162
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,372
I was saved by Sasame,
you know.

163
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,790
Me too.

164
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,710
What do you mean?

165
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,047
Water came rushing into that
trap pit we were in earlier...

166
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,856
That's it! The lid to the pit!

167
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,653
Damn!

168
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,706
When the water reached
the ceiling,

169
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,085
I desperately tried to open the lid,
but wasn't able to escape...

170
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,677
I was told by Master Jiraiya
to go to where Hanzaki is.

171
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,433
But I got concerned about Arashi,
so I came...

172
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,487
Naruto!

173
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,991
Hey! Thanks!

174
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
Th-The frog spoke...!

175
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,707
Well, come to think of it,

176
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,544
there's no way you could open the lid
of the trap by pushing on it.

177
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,629
Geez!

178
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,091
But how come the thread that
I couldn't cut with the Kunai Knife,

179
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,844
be cut when I wrapped it
with Sasame's tag?

180
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,100
Because the Chakra Thread
is a Secret Technique

181
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,019
within the secrets of
our Fuuma Ninja Technique...

182
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,688
Of the Fuuma?!

183
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:23,525
Oh I see...
So who the heck is this?!

184
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,112
Oh!

185
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,835
She is...from earlier!

186
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,256
Mistress Kagero...

187
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,135
She's a Fuuma Jonin.

188
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,761
Sasame!

189
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,348
Sasame...

190
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:01,730
I was resurrected
by Lord Orochimaru...

191
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,066
You! You're being tricked
by Orochimaru!

192
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,609
Where is Sasuke?

193
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,739
And Arashi?
Where's Sasame's cousin!

194
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,034
Lord Orochimaru is...

195
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,789
going to raise our Fuuma clan...

196
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,500
to the center stage
of Shinobi again.

197
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,795
You're still talking about
that stuff?!

198
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,132
At least tell Sasame the truth!

199
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,562
So it's there! He's in there!

200
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:52,238
Sasame and Arashi...
You two were so close...

201
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,537
Then it'd be better
if you didn't see him.

202
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,480
Mistress Kagero ...

203
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,111
What do you want to do, Sasame?

204
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,656
Do you want to wait here?

205
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,082
I will see him!
No matter what's in store for me!

206
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,544
I came all the way here
to see Arashi!

207
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,505
Yeah! You've got guts!

208
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,675
All right! Let's go together!

209
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,218
Yeah! Let's go!

210
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,311
Sasame...

211
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,486
There might be some sort of trap...

212
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,196
Leave it to me!

213
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,752
Orochimaru?!

214
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,719
Good of you to come, Sasame...

215
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,221
Why...?

216
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,610
Arashi...!

217
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,030
Arashi!

218
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,491
Arashi?

219
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,203
I'm no longer...

220
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,041
Arashi...

221
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,564
Wh-What the heck is going on?!

222
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:40,073
The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin
were combined into one...

223
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,534
and I've been reborn as
the ultimate Ninja you see...

224
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:51,793
Now, I'll show you
my ultimate Ninjutsu...

225
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,503
Sasame!

226
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,465
No... Arashi...

227
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,969
Damn, Orochimaru!

228
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,889
I will not forgive him,
no matter what!

229
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,441
When I recalled the parts one by one,

230
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:21,781
I felt as though
I had understood everything

231
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

232
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:32,625
which I kept so close to me

233
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:38,423
Speechless nights,

234
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,093
a hint of warmth, and

235
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:49,100
and this distant yearning for you

236
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,103
I live,

237
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:57,942
simply repeating this cycle

238
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:07,118
Held in my two hands

239
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,871
A droplet of time

240
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,754
Softly clutching forgotten memories

241
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

242
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,810
I'll keep these thoughts...

243
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,026
Sorry... I'm sorry, Naruto.

244
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,279
I haven't been able to do anything,
after all.

245
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,866
I'm always dragging you down.
I hadn't changed at all.

246
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:51,412
But Naruto, Sasame,
you two taught me.

247
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,166
That's why I want to change
the kind of person I am!

248
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,045
This time, this time,
it's my turn to give it my all!

249
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,881
Next time, "Sakura's Determination!"
