1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,909
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,922
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,733
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,651
If "Heaven" does not exist,

20
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,402
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

21
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,362
If "Earth" does not exist,

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,405
run the fields in search
of an advantage.

23
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,243
Open the series of Heaven and Earth,
and the perilous way shall be redressed...

24
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,997
This is namely the secret of
"the one that guides..."

25
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,041
What's that?

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,460
It probably has to do with the scroll.

27
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:11,549
I think this means we're supposed
to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.

28
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,856
Okay then, I'm going to open it.

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,828
Huh? What's this?

30
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,746
A man...?

31
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,831
A person...?

32
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,754
This is...a Summoning Jutsu!

33
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,591
Naruto! Sakura!
Let go of the scroll!

34
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,508
Oh...

35
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,062
Wha...?!

36
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,231
Y-You...

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,325
Hi!

38
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,244
It's been a long time.

39
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:30,336
Surviving the Cut!
The Rookie Nine Together Again!

40
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,218
W-What's going on?

41
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,722
It appears you guys have had
a rough time of it.

42
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,140
What?!

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,936
Why are you appearing with
a Summoning?

44
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,146
At the end of this second exam,

45
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,192
we Chunin are to
welcome the test-takers.

46
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,486
I just happened to be given

47
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,906
the important task of being
the messenger for you guys.

48
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,075
Messenger...?!

49
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,790
Just in time.

50
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,251
Everyone...

51
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,714
Congratulations on surviving
the second exam.

52
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,218
To celebrate your passing,

53
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,930
I'd like to treat you to
some Ichiraku ramen, but...

54
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,307
Ohh... Cool!

55
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,475
Uh-oh...

56
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,185
H-Hey, Naruto!

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,354
-Listen to the end...
-Cool! Cool!

58
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,149
Ramen! Ramen!
Believe it!

59
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,861
I've done great job!
I'm the greatest!

60
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,781
I so want to eat ramen!
Believe it!

61
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,742
He's got so much energy.

62
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,786
Yaaaay!

63
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,704
Shut up!

64
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:52,167
Man, that scatterbrained part
of you is the same as always, eh.

65
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,713
I see.

66
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,630
Huh?

67
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,259
If we had looked at the scroll
in the middle of the exam,

68
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,555
what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?

69
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,062
Sasuke, you're a sharp one,
as usual.

70
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,275
You guessed right.

71
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:22,239
The rules of this exam were to test
your conclusive mission execution ability.

72
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,199
To put it simply,

73
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:29,413
in the case of the scrolls being opened
contrary to the rules...

74
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,331
In the case of them being opened...?

75
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:41,133
I was ordered to knock unconscious
the test-takers in front of me

76
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,053
until the end of the exam.

77
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,557
Good thing you didn't open the scroll.

78
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,145
Kabuto, thank you!

79
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,730
Phew!

80
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,232
That was seriously close...

81
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,445
Oh yeah, Sensei!

82
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,863
Huh?

83
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,157
By the way,
what're the letters on that wall?

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,868
They're kind of vermiculated and

85
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,329
we don't understand
their meaning at all.

86
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,457
Never mind, never mind!

87
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,667
We passed!

88
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:21,632
No...explaining that is
one more of my duties.

89
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,093
What, really?

90
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,595
I'm saying that's right.

91
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,014
Give it a read.

92
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,560
These are Chunin instructions
Master Hokage recorded.

93
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,562
Instructions?!

94
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,855
That's right!

95
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,110
Heaven in this text
refers to the human head.

96
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,029
Earth refers to the human body.

97
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,447
No kidding...

98
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,990
If "Heaven" does not exist,

99
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,493
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

100
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,370
In other words...

101
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,957
If your weaknesses are
inside your head, Naruto...

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,044
learn various logics in
preparing for your missions.

103
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,338
Hah! So meddlesome!

104
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,758
If "Earth" does not exist,

105
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,511
run through the fields
in search of an advantage.

106
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,597
If your weaknesses are in
your physical strength, Sakura,

107
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:16,228
it means you must not
slack off on your daily training.

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,859
And if you combine both
Heaven and Earth...

109
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,945
Any perilous mission is the right way...

110
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,113
In other words...

111
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,826
what can also be called a rule
of might and become a safe mission.

112
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,495
Then, what about
the spot with the missing letter?

113
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,958
The letter refers to Chunin.

114
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:43,380
The one letter for "person" that
was in the scroll from earlier goes there.

115
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,008
These five days of survival
were to test

116
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,678
the test-takers' fundamental
abilities as Chunin.

117
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,223
And you guys cleared it in fine style.

118
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,852
Chunin is of unit-leader class.

119
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,854
They have the responsibility
of leading a team.

120
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,816
Be more deeply aware of
the necessity of physical strength...

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,612
and knowledge in missions!

122
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,866
I want you to take on
the next step,

123
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,784
never forgetting these
Chunin instructions.

124
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,081
That is all of the messenger task
I was given.

125
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,169
Got it!

126
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,721
Huh?

127
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:41,647
But, as for the final third exam,
don't push it too far.

128
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,774
Especially you, Naruto.

129
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,151
-You're the biggest worry...
-Iruka Sensei.

130
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,946
From when I received the
Leaf headband,

131
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,115
I was no longer
an Academy student, you know?!

132
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,159
There's nothing to worry!
Believe it!

133
00:08:55,702 --> 00:09:00,207
Also, this is the proof you
gave me that I'm full-fledged, right?!

134
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,669
That I'm scatterbrained may
not have changed,

135
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,046
but I'm not a kid anymore!

136
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,591
I'm now...

137
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,888
A Ninja!

138
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,439
I see.

139
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,191
I'm sorry, Naruto.

140
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,116
I know their strength the best.

141
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,409
If it's futile anyway,

142
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,411
I would like to give them
the final word personally.

143
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:41,999
If you're that hung up on it,
I can leave that team to you.

144
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,336
To think you'd play the devil's advocate...

145
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,839
Thank you very much.

146
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,217
But, they're Kakashi's, right?

147
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,470
If he's the one who
recommended them,

148
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,307
I thought I could count on them.

149
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,479
Stay out of it!

150
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:10,777
They're not your students anymore.
They're my subordinates now.

151
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,828
The one who might truly understand

152
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,459
the strength of these kids.
might be you, Kakashi.

153
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,719
How is it?

154
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,388
Does the Curse Mark still hurt?

155
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,431
No.

156
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,641
Thanks to you,
it's gotten quite a bit better.

157
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:48,565
Anyway, Orochimaru is one
of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?

158
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,026
He's a S-rank bingo book
rouge Shinobi

159
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,071
who even the Anbu couldn't touch, right?

160
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,157
I heard that he'd already died, but...

161
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,911
Why'd he come to this village now...?

162
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,755
There's a kid I want, you see.

163
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:18,053
This kid inherits the abilities
of the Uchiha clan, so...

164
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,934
It's...

165
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,520
It's probably Sasuke, right?

166
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,479
Huh?!

167
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,564
Master Anko!

168
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,777
Twenty-one second exam
finishers have been confirmed.

169
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,030
As for the third exam, according
to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,

170
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,241
preliminaries are planned for
the first time in five years.

171
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,660
The second exam is over.

172
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,880
For the time being,
continue the exams as is,

173
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,426
but while keeping
an eye on his movements.

174
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,510
Yes...

175
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,110
First off, congratulations on
finishing the second exam.

176
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,574
There were seventy-eight
test-takers for the second exam.

177
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,326
To think twenty-one have
made it this far.

178
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,123
I said to make it less than half,
but I'd really thought about single digits.

179
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm hungry!

180
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,599
There are still this many remaining?

181
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,058
This is such a major pain.

182
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,897
Sasuke and others have passed, too.

183
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,857
Of course...

184
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,114
We went to that much trouble
to save them...

185
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,617
It'd all be for naught if they didn't pass.

186
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,998
Your team didn't do too bad.

187
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,626
I guess they were lucky.

188
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,339
But as long as my team is around,
they can't go any higher.

189
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,050
After all, whether you
like it or not,

190
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,177
ability talks at the next barrier.

191
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,055
Well, adolescence can sometimes
be bittersweet and

192
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,224
can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi...

193
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,310
Did you say something?

194
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:35,148
Oh my God!

195
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,529
Not bad, my rival Kakashi.

196
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,658
But that part of you is so hip...
which is what annoys me!

197
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,037
So that's Guy Sensei's eternal rival, eh?

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,249
Guy Sensei totally loses visually...

199
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,461
Guy Sensei is the hippest
of all the teachers!

200
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,504
He shines!

201
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,421
Okay!

202
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,385
Please watch, Guy Sensei!
I'll shine, too!

203
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:23,572
I don't ever want to see
tears of those dear to me again.

204
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,032
So...

205
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,244
I won't ever lose again!

206
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,537
Guy Sensei.

207
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,748
Sure enough, the outstanding candidates
have gathered.

208
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,754
Sasuke Uchiha, eh?

209
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,970
I'll get you back for my arms,
Sasuke Uchiha...

210
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,014
At any cost.

211
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,904
To think a mere seven teams
are left of the twenty-six...

212
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,410
Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.

213
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,332
Akamaru's acting strange...

214
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,213
Those Sand Village guys...

215
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,135
Naruto passed, too.

216
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,387
Thank goodness...

217
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,516
What, all the Leaf Village
rookies are here.

218
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,310
Say! Say!

219
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,481
Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and
even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!

220
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,691
It feels like everyone's assembled.

221
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:46,154
Humph...I don't have a very good feeling.

222
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,701
To think this many are left...

223
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,121
Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies...

224
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,584
So that's why they fought
in recommending them.

225
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,046
Now then, we will now have
the explanation of the third exam

226
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,631
from Master Hokage.

227
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,549
Listen carefully, everybody!

228
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,303
Now then, if you will,
Master Hokage.

229
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,304
All right.

230
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,692
Before the explanation of
the third exam that we will start from now,

231
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:28,238
I have just one thing I want
to tell everyone flat out.

232
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,368
About the true purpose of these exams.

233
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,161
True purpose...?!

234
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:41,334
Why do allied nations conduct
the exams on a conjoint basis?

235
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,711
Huh?

236
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:48,216
Raising the levels of the shinobi
and friendship among allied nations.

237
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,137
It won't do to have the wrong idea
of the true meaning of that statement.

238
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,180
These exams are so to speak...

239
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,182
So to speak...?

240
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,361
A microcosm of battle
between allied nations.

241
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,322
What does that mean?

242
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,117
If we look back on history,

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,036
the allied nations of today were
once neighboring nations

244
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,750
that continued to vie with
each other and battle for power.

245
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:27,714
In order to avoid a futile crushing
of each others' military strength,

246
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,175
those nations mutually selected
a place to battle.

247
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:36,139
And that was how the
Chunin Exams originally began.

248
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:44,022
W-Why do we have
to do such a thing?

249
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,649
We're not doing this to
select Chunins?!

250
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:53,323
There is no question that these exams
are to select Shinobi

251
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,617
worthy of becoming Chunin.

252
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,286
But on the other hand,

253
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,289
these exams also provide a venue

254
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:06,127
for Shinobi who carry their nation's pride
on their backs to fight for their lives!

255
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,546
Nation's pride...?

256
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,635
Many feudal lords and those of
prominence from many nations

257
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:19,349
who request Shinobi for work
are invited to this third exam as guests.

258
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,062
And, the feudal lords and
Head Ninja of each Village

259
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:28,358
of the nations will watch your battles.

260
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,361
If the gap in national power
becomes unbridgeable,

261
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,531
the strong nations are inundated
with job requests.

262
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:39,452
The requests of nations deemed
weak, on the other hand, decline.

263
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,037
And therewithal,

264
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,877
we can exert pressure upon
each neighboring nation...

265
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:52,465
That is to say, just how much military
strength our Village is developing and has.

266
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,427
Even so, why is it necessary for
us to fight for our lives?!

267
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,515
The nation's strength is
the Village's strength.

268
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,142
The Village's strength is
the Shinobi's strength.

269
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,691
And the true strength of the Shinobi
is created only in a fight for one's life!

270
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:15,530
This exam is a place to see
the strength of home country Shinobi,

271
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,615
and a place to display this as well.

272
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,494
It is because it's an exam where
you truly fight for your life

273
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,620
that this has meaning.

274
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:26,916
It's for this very reason that
your forerunners fought in this exam,

275
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,086
a dream worth striving for.

276
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,092
Then why...
use the expression "friendship"?!

277
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,554
I said it at the start, didn't I?!

278
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,765
That it won't do for you to have
the wrong idea of the meaning!

279
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:49,230
It's a custom where balance is
preserved by fighting and removing life.

280
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,024
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.

281
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,027
This is a fight for life with
the pride of the village and

282
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,030
one's own dream on the line.

283
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,206
Heh, I'm convinced.

284
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,042
Anything is fine.

285
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:14,130
Just tell us the content of
that fight-for-life test.

286
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,048
Very well.

287
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:20,345
Now then, this is where I'd like to
explain the third exam.

288
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,429
But actually...

289
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:31,272
Master Hokage, please allow me,
Hayate Gekko,

290
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,066
who was given the task of judge,
to speak first.

291
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,318
I leave it to you...

292
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,112
Nice to meet you, everyone...

293
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,452
Umm, there's something...
I'd like you all to do...

294
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,997
before the third exam.

295
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,478
Hey, can you hear it?

296
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,939
The clear,

297
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:18,695
blue sky goes on and on

298
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,536
The ocean spans limitlessly

299
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:35,628
Please keep that smile on your face forever

300
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:43,469
Or else I'll cry

301
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

302
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,935
It's all ok now.

303
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:56,774
Everyone is inside

304
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:00,069
this hand

305
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:05,324
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

306
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,746
When you forget what happiness is

307
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,708
Just sing.

308
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:19,005
Light is born, and darkness was born

309
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,299
The two are one

310
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:27,680
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

311
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:33,269
Hey, can you hear it?

312
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,234
What's the idea?
Sudden preliminaries?

313
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:44,697
Didn't we just get to the tower?
Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.

314
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,617
It's too much for you, Sasuke!
Please, drop out!

315
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,078
You're in no condition
to fight properly!

316
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,038
No matter what you say,

317
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,457
I'm going to tell the teachers
about that bruise.

318
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,837
Next episode: "Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!"

319
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,839
Sasuke, I'm scared.

320
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,925
<=sign>1
