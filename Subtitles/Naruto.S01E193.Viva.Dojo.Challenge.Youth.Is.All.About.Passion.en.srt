1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,970
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:57,224
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:12,656
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,395
Viva Dojo Challenge!
Youth is all about Passion!

16
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:48,484
It's been a while, hasn't it, Naruto?
Were you alone on a mission this time?

17
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,154
I just went to deliver
Grandma Tsunade's letter...

18
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,991
Is that so? Then you should
report to Lady Tsunade right away.

19
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,701
I know!

20
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,622
I've only been away for a week,

21
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,291
but it seems as though
an awful lot has changed.

22
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,794
DOJO CHALLENGERS,
COME THIS WAY

23
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,088
That sign wasn't here before, either.

24
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,965
Dojo challenge?

25
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,430
MAKE-OUR VIOLENCE 3

26
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,641
This way?

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,729
This is a tight squeeze.

28
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,439
Is that it?

29
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:33,070
PASSION DOJO
"Passion Dojo."
Who on earth built this?

30
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,117
I've been waiting for you!

31
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,368
Huh?

32
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,370
You've come here
for a Dojo challenge, right?

33
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,208
Well, then.
Come at me from anywhere you like!

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,711
Huh? Bushy Brow?

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,714
If you don't make a move,
I'm coming at you!

36
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,215
What? Wait, hold it.

37
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,010
Hey, it's me!
It's only me, Bushy Brow!

38
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,431
Naruto!

39
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,518
Hey, that was close, I tell you!

40
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,897
So the first Dojo challenger
will be you, Naruto!

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,607
Well, I couldn't wish for
a better opponent!

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,025
Huh?

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,860
I'm going to go at this for real!

44
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,862
W-Wait just a minute!

45
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,405
Leaf Hurricane!

46
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,036
Here...

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,371
So you just came to view the grounds?

48
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,001
Then you should have said so
in the first place.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,798
I never even got a chance to tell you.
You just suddenly attacked me.

50
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,843
I'm really sorry about that.

51
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,680
Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,893
Yes. I have been working on it
for quite some time

53
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,312
and finally completed it 6 days ago.

54
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,149
This flyer was distributed
not only in Hidden Leaf Village,

55
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,610
but in all the nearby
towns and villages as well.

56
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,153
You don't say?

57
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,615
I've been away on a mission
and have only just returned...

58
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,741
Is that so?

59
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,619
But why a Dojo?

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,996
It's all for training.

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,998
For training?

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,919
Well, actually, I've been busy
with missions lately

63
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,964
and have not been able to set aside
as much time for training as I'd like to.

64
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,008
And even on those occasions when
I was able to take time out...

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,389
it was difficult to find practice partners,
so I wasn't able to train efficiently.

66
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,851
Just when I was wondering
what I ought to do about it

67
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,646
YOUTH
I saw something in a village
I visited on a mission...

68
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,775
I request a challenge!

69
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,988
Please come this way.

70
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,197
Okay...

71
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,705
I have traveled near and far
in search of training...

72
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,207
I'd like to have a practice match.

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,920
But if I should win,
I'll claim your marquee.

74
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,217
A Dojo challenge, huh?
Very well, I shall have a match with you.

75
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,722
Here I come!

76
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,019
If I were to open my own Dojo,

77
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:14,314
someone with confidence in his skills
will surely come to challenge me!

78
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,987
So, I opened the Dojo thinking
it would give me good practice,

79
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,033
but nobody has come
to challenge me yet...

80
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,037
Hmmm... Is that so?

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,919
Say, since you're here, Naruto,
won't you try out for a Dojo challenge?

82
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,090
If you win,
I'll give you the sign I painted myself.

83
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,468
I have no need for such things.

84
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,054
Don't say that!
Please, by all means!

85
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,894
C-Come to think of it,
I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!

86
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,145
I'd better go right away!

87
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,271
See you later!

88
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,648
Naruto!

89
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,902
Please be my first!

90
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,573
Damn it. I waited so much time
thanks to Bushy Brow.

91
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,409
Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.

92
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,872
I'd better steer clear of Bushy Brow's Dojo
for the time being.

93
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,957
What's that I hear about Lee's Dojo?

94
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,502
Intense Brow Sensei...?

95
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,507
Naruto, what do you mean by that?

96
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:27,304
Do you mean to tell me
that he opened a Dojo to train himself

97
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:31,100
while I was away from the village
on a mission?

98
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,686
Splendid, if I may say so
about my own student!

99
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,732
I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!

100
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,321
But the all-important Dojo challengers
are yet to appear... Not a single one.

101
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,784
Damn those Dojo challengers!

102
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,453
To think that Lee's earnest hopes
have come to naught...

103
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:55,165
I'll search high and low
and give them a hit they can not forget!

104
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,251
But, if you do that,

105
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,670
you'll just make even less people
want to visit for a challenge.

106
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,632
Ah, that's right...
Whatever shall I do then?!

107
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:10,430
I've got it. If no one come
to challenge his Dojo, then...

108
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:17,688
Why don't I myself go to Lee's Dojo,
disguised as a Dojo challenger?

109
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,651
I'll play the part of Lee's first!

110
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,871
A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.

111
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,040
He wouldn't dream that
this was me, no way.

112
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,460
Here I come, Lee.

113
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,045
Guy Sensei!

114
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,258
I finally found you.

115
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,845
If it isn't Sakura!
What is going on?

116
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,099
Guy, forgive me for bothering you
when you've only just returned, but...

117
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,728
an emergency relief request has come in
from Shikamaru's squad,

118
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,314
which was assigned to
transport unit duty.

119
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,568
We know nothing whatsoever about
the true nature and scale of the enemy.

120
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,905
Therefore... there is a possibility of this
developing into something major

121
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,449
if we err in our initial encounter.

122
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,453
Judging from reports,
they should be nearby.

123
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,996
They're close by.

124
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,458
First, you go reconnoiter
to confirm the situation.

125
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,503
If they seem to need additional relief,
I will make immediate arrangements.

126
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,548
Yes, roger that.

127
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,389
Can that strange getup
have some significance?

128
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,392
I don't know...

129
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,776
What's with that strange fellow?

130
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,780
Well, no matter.
I'll borrow his form

131
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,115
to infiltrate Leaf Village.

132
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,705
The Village Hidden in the Leaves'
secrets...

133
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,209
I, Nanafushi,
shall investigate every last detail!

134
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,130
Was that guy really
looking for a Dojo challenge?

135
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,884
Yeah. That's what he claimed to be,
so there can be no doubt.

136
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,552
He says he came
because he saw the flyers.

137
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,888
I wonder if he got lost or something...

138
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,518
Intense Brow Sensei, how long
do you intend to keep us waiting?

139
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,899
Naruto, I think, after all, I'd like
to have you be a Dojo challenger...

140
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,487
Oh no.

141
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,948
I'll go look for him!

142
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,908
Naruto!

143
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,869
Let's work up a youthful sweat with me!

144
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,374
Oh, he returned after all.

145
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,043
I knew that get up would be problematic.

146
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,006
What?
What's the problem?

147
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,009
Huh?

148
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,679
Sensei...?
What's with the strange disguise?

149
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,180
Everyone can still tell it's you!

150
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,269
I...I didn't think it was
such a great idea, either.

151
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,397
What's the matter?

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,151
Don't tell me these guys
have discovered my true identify!

153
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,028
Intense Brow Sensei!

154
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,530
Sensei!

155
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,785
Quit lollygagging
and get over to Lee's Dojo!

156
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,622
If you don't go, then I'll have to fight him!
Come on!

157
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,083
Be seeing you...!

158
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,753
I guess you could say...

159
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,546
That's typical of him...

160
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,758
I'm safe thanks to this guy...

161
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,720
I should attach myself to him for a while
and scope out the situation in the village.

162
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,933
What is this place?

163
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,227
This is Lee's Dojo!

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:49,107
But, really... Couldn't you have
come up with a little better disguise?

165
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,443
Well, never mind!

166
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:55,072
Lee must be tired of waiting,
so try to do a good acting job!

167
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,033
Acting?
What is he talking about?

168
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,703
I've brought him with me, Bushy Brow!

169
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,207
I've been waiting for you...!

170
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,169
Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!

171
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,712
Huh...?

172
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,632
Please come this way!

173
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,884
Um...um.

174
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,930
At time like this, you're supposed to say,
"I request a challenge match," right?

175
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,598
I-I see...

176
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,643
I-I request a challenge match!

177
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:29,481
Do I hear that familiar call?
You indeed are a Dojo challenger!

178
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:35,362
Fair enough! If you win,
you can have my marquee!

179
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,700
Could it be that I've been
mistaken for a Dojo challenger?

180
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,369
Oh my god...

181
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,288
Huh?!
He's just a kid...

182
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,959
Well, it can't be helped.
I'll go easy on him...

183
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,086
Okay! Here I come!

184
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,796
– Ready!
– Huh?

185
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,131
He disappeared?

186
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,718
Huh...?

187
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,596
Wh-What happened...?

188
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,227
This little brat...!

189
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,981
Take that! And that!
And this! And that!

190
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,482
He's strong!

191
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,696
What's going on?!

192
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,160
I know you're only acting, but you're still
giving him too much of a break, Sensei.

193
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,415
Oh, I see. He's not fighting back because
it'll ruin his disguise!

194
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:36,173
Even if I had nine lives,
I'd never survive this fellow...

195
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,135
I think I'd better wave a white flag
and withdraw here.

196
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,639
I-I concede...

197
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,685
Then that means...I did it!

198
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,855
I splendidly fought off
my first Dojo challenger!

199
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,565
No, that's not it at all!

200
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,902
What he means by "concede"

201
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,613
is that he concedes
to be a Dojo challenger, right?

202
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,367
In other words,
he's just been warming up,

203
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,329
and now comes
the real challenge, right?

204
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,665
No, that's not it at all!

205
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,376
So that's what you meant, after all...

206
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,338
I thought it was odd that

207
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,716
that an experienced Dojo challenger
would surrender.

208
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,594
It's not odd!
There's nothing odd about it at all!

209
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,056
Well, then, I'll have to really
get down to business now, too!

210
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,976
What! You mean you haven't even
really gotten started yet?

211
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,941
Hey! Intense Brow Sensei
is a pretty good actor!

212
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:42,113
He's even taking more hits so that
Bushy Brow won't know it's him.

213
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,202
What?
You were only attacked by monkeys?

214
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,580
They were after the snacks
that Choji procured

215
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,415
but the important load is safe.!

216
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,211
My snacks ... by a monkey...

217
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,257
Ino mistook that for
an enemy's attack

218
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,050
and sent out
an emergency relief request.

219
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,177
But, it was so sudden!

220
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,139
Anyway, it's your fault
for procuring so many snacks!

221
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,100
These snacks were available
only for a limited time,

222
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,060
and moreover,
only available in the Land of Tea,

223
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,604
the Super-rare
"Green tea Pork-flavored" chips!

224
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,316
For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin
to refrain from buying

225
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,735
a limited offering of snacks
once one has found them!

226
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,696
Like I care about stuff like that!

227
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,864
What?
What?!

228
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,203
Shikamaru, things are tough for you,
aren't they?

229
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,416
Right back at you. That outfit...
Did something happen?

230
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,877
Huh? What about my outfit...?

231
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,546
Here.

232
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,426
Oh, that's right!
I haven't got time for dallying here!

233
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,052
I've got to get over to Lee's dojo!

234
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,013
Just wait for me, Lee!

235
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,149
You're overdoing
on purposefully getting beaten, Sensei...

236
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,614
Is he finished now?

237
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,282
Whoa, hold it! Time out!

238
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,580
Fight back a little, will you?!

239
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,291
It's impossible, I tell you.

240
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,627
If Lee doesn't
find this challenging enough,

241
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,297
I might get stuck being his opponent.

242
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,174
Actually...

243
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,968
It's been one extreme mission
after another lately,

244
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,720
and I haven't gotten any sleep at all...

245
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,930
What? You don't say...

246
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,142
If I got a little rest,
I think I might recover, but...

247
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,732
While I take a rest,
won't you be his opponent for a while?

248
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,858
What?!

249
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,318
I'm begging you!

250
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,030
Wh-What is that?

251
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,990
I'm coming, Lee!

252
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,494
G-Guy?

253
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,829
I thought he already entered the village
a while ago...

254
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,000
S-Sorry to keep you waiting!

255
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,255
You've weathered such an attack
and you're still undamaged...

256
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,423
You're quite a fellow!

257
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,801
The world is vast...

258
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,345
To think that such
an awesome Dojo challenger exists!

259
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,348
It was worth building this Dojo!

260
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,143
There's no way I could win
with only Taijutsu!

261
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,313
If that's the case,
then with I'll fight my way...

262
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,773
Here I come!

263
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,775
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

264
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,780
But, of course! He's well acquainted
with Ninjutsu too!

265
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,990
Leaf Hurricane!

266
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,285
The real body is... right above me!

267
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,499
Primary Lotus!

268
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,170
Is this a clone, too?

269
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,632
Got you!

270
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,968
Here I go, one more time!

271
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,429
Another Shadow Clone?

272
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,638
Nope...!

273
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,725
Stop it, Lee.

274
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,727
S-Sakura?

275
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,688
– Be nice, now!
– Don't be too hard on me.

276
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,356
– Please!
– Don't be mean!

277
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,778
So many Sakura...
Guy Sensei! I'm moved!

278
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,531
I've never known such happiness
before in my life!

279
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,074
Wha...?!

280
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,620
We did it!

281
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,127
I guess I forgot...
that this is a fight with a challenger.

282
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,506
Just as one might expect...
But I won't fall for the same trick again!

283
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,094
Even though they may look like Sakura,
they're really just phony Transformation!

284
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,264
How can you say that, Lee!

285
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,559
Hurry back, Sensei!

286
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,190
For brats,
they fight such a high-level fight...

287
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,026
– Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs...
– How about this?!

288
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,569
I wonder if the rumors that

289
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,279
– they lost its vigor were just lies?
– In that case...

290
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,864
– I guess I need to
– Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

291
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,491
investigate this further...

292
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,077
This disguise is problematic...

293
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,498
I get a feeling
I will be embroiled in trouble again.

294
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,086
Let's go with this.
Well then, shall I be taking my leave?

295
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,215
Hold it right there!

296
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,717
The real thing!

297
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,471
I see that you are Rock Lee,
master of this Dojo.

298
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,266
Oh no.
I guess I'll have to play along with him...

299
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,979
Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee,
master of this dojo...

300
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,860
I am a Dojo challenger!

301
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,865
Rock Lee, I shall defeat you
and claim your marquee!

302
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,368
Here I come!

303
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,586
You fight a pretty good fight.

304
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,630
You, too...

305
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,344
H-Help!

306
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,804
B-Bushy Brow?!

307
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,307
Dynamic Entry!

308
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,937
A-Another Dojo challenger?!

309
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,399
Intense Brow Sensei!
What took you so long?!

310
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,154
N-Naruto...what's the meaning of this?

311
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,991
If you can't dodge
even this much of an attack,

312
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,242
you are not worth all the talk!

313
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,370
Your training is inadequate!

314
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,789
N-No... This is... I mean...

315
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,626
It's about Million years too early for you
to be building your own Dojo!

316
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:34,257
I must straighten that spoiled attitude
of yours with my own fist!

317
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,931
Forgive me Lee...
It's my whip of love!

318
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,436
So, the true identity of the challenger
was you, Guy Sensei!

319
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:51,441
What? You're Lee?
Then, who was I punching?

320
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,823
Who's that guy?

321
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,785
Good grief...

322
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,582
Come in!
Oh, it's you, Guy...

323
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,126
And you're with Naruto and Lee.

324
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,714
That's perfect.
I was just about to call you all.

325
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,758
Has something happened?

326
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,594
Just now, some intelligence came in...

327
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,221
A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys,
by the name of Nanafushi,

328
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,974
is said to have been seeking
inside information on our village.

329
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,228
He may already have
infiltrated the village.

330
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:34,108
I want you to go search for this Nanafushi
immediately and capture him...

331
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,487
Oh!

332
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,821
That man...

333
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,990
You have an idea of where he might be?

334
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,492
– It's this guy!
– It's this man!

335
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,292
I don't really know what's going on...
but our mission is complete!

336
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,586
Well then, we'll be going.

337
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,005
Hey! Don't just leave him here!

338
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,840
Oh! Guy Sensei!

339
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:03,596
Explain what happened!
Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!

340
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,193
In the small hours of the morning
when the trees and grasses are asleep

341
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,279
and the forest is deafly calm...

342
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:49,035
A signpost standing forlorn
starts telling of the destruction of a clan.

343
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:54,957
Suddenly with a strike of thunder,
heavy rain begins to fall down.

344
00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:00,379
What could be the true identity
of the Iron Castle that appeared?!

345
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,925
Next Time: "The Mysterious Curse
of the Haunted Castle"
