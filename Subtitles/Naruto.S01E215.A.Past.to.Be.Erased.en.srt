1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,139
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,831
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,308
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,315
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,529
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,708
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:36,180
A Past to Be Erased

15
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,599
That mark...

16
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,769
I saw the same one on the guys
that attacked this village!

17
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,106
- That's a lie!
- It's not a lie! This mark...

18
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,316
Same from that night...

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,627
N-No! Spare me!

20
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,173
Stop!

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,696
This is the same mark from
that time.

22
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,864
No way!

23
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,284
But this wasn't in
the medical team's report.

24
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,035
Byakugan!

25
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,790
It seems this is a particular mark
that only emerges

26
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,834
when he sweats...

27
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,294
You guys get out!

28
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,753
Why?

29
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,172
I'm going to take care of him.

30
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,884
Say what?! I won't let you do that!

31
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,971
Why do you protect him?
Is the Leaf Village also in cahoots?

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,639
No, that's not it!

33
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,852
He doesn't remember
a thing from the past...

34
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,689
He has no memory.

35
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,149
No memory?

36
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,820
It's memory loss.
We came in search of his memory.

37
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:19,241
Then you should know now.
He's a dirty bandit!

38
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,369
Whether or not he has a memory
makes no difference to me!

39
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,704
Calm down!

40
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,290
It would only be in vain
to kill someone

41
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,666
who has no memory of
committing a crime.

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,876
Shut up!

43
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,921
If you really want to have
your revenge,

44
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,132
do so as much as you like
after getting his memory back...

45
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,051
I won't stop you at that time.

46
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,223
I won't let you do that even if
he gets his memory back!

47
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,976
It's as Neji says.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,270
We'll also find out the identity
of the guys who attacked

49
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,731
if his memory returns
and we get him to talk.

50
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,777
We might be able to save the village
if we can use him to cut a deal...

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,156
We have to keep him alive now.
We won't run away or hide!

52
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,078
Keep quiet... He won't let Menma live
unless we tell him this.

53
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,834
I'm going to sew up the wound.
Hold his arms and legs.

54
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,303
That girl is...

55
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,545
I just can't believe it.
He's the embodiment of good nature...

56
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,588
To think he'd be a comrade
of the bandits.

57
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,800
I wonder if he became a good guy
after losing his memory.

58
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:04,346
He just has the same mark as those guys
due to some sort of circumstance.

59
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,348
Even if he lost his memory,

60
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,685
he wouldn't become this good-natured
of a guy if he was a bad person.

61
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,604
Either way, we'll know everything
if he get his memory back.

62
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,193
I was...a comrade of the bandits,
wasn't I?

63
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,738
You heard us talking earlier?

64
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:28,787
Don't worry about it.
We don't know any of the details. Okay?

65
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,792
Heal that wound for now...

66
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,012
I'm going to have
a look around the area.

67
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,180
You understand, right?

68
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,932
Your friends and that guy will die
if you try anything funny.

69
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,435
Do as you like when that happens.

70
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,506
It's done...

71
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,429
Fuki...

72
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,267
You heard, didn't you?

73
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,312
I can't stand it, after all!

74
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,523
Let's get him. Let's avenge everyone!

75
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,774
Stop!

76
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,319
It's still not certain that
Menma's one of their comrades!

77
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,572
You're just as much to blame
if you protect him!

78
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,031
– Right!
– Right!

79
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,324
What's the ruckus?!

80
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,118
Naruto?

81
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,411
Tenten...!

82
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,246
Why did you let him out of the hut?!

83
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,790
Sorry. I dozed off...

84
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,002
I got careless thinking
he couldn't move...

85
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,256
Guys, stop! He has no memory!

86
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,468
So he doesn't even know if
he's one of their comrades or not...!

87
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,012
We warned you before!

88
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,307
You guys are just as much to blame
if you protect him any further!

89
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,767
Get them!

90
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,977
Stop it!

91
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,272
We should get away for now!

92
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,482
I'm...fine...

93
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,942
What?

94
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:08,739
Of course, everyone's angry.
I...should be punished.

95
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,823
You'll be killed!

96
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,116
That's fine!

97
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,826
What're you saying, Menma?!

98
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,166
Byakugan!

99
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,882
It's them!

100
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,759
The bridge! Raise the bridge!

101
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,094
-Right!
-Got it!

102
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,454
Be careful of the Leaf Ninja and
secure an entrance route!

103
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,664
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

104
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,874
Now's our chance.
Everyone hide!

105
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,002
You, too!

106
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,755
We can take care of this ourselves!

107
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,800
Come on, Fuki!

108
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,770
They've come from two spots!

109
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,898
Where'd they go?!

110
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,149
They vanished.

111
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,234
Be quiet!

112
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,118
The wind...

113
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,453
I get it.

114
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,330
They've trapped us
in a Genjutsu

115
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,125
with a different tone mixed in
with the sound of the wind!

116
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,046
Be careful!
We're now inside their Jutsu!

117
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,841
You noticed too late!

118
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,555
M-My body...

119
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,639
It's heavy...

120
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,725
This is bad... Is it Paralysis?!

121
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,103
Canceling Sound!

122
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,483
The Paralysis is released.

123
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,194
You backstabber!

124
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,362
Here they come!

125
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,364
I'll leave those guys to you!

126
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,825
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

127
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,703
It's futile!

128
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,292
Heh, what's the matter?
Finished already?!

129
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,253
I don't even have a scratch on me...

130
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,299
This is what I was after!

131
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,508
Wha...?!

132
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,806
What's happening?
I'm getting an amazing power.

133
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,308
Here I go!

134
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,601
Rotation!

135
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,564
Now, prepare yourself!

136
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,275
You won't get away!

137
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,383
Here...

138
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,510
This is precious to you, right?

139
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,354
Behind you!

140
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,605
You jerk!

141
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,445
Your voice... It's back!

142
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,697
Th-Thank you...

143
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,034
Now, let's go back to the others.

144
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,119
Right.

145
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,207
Menma! You okay?

146
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,625
Yeah...

147
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,544
We took care of most of them!

148
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,964
What about their leader?
What about Shiin?!

149
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,051
I chased after him,
but he got away...

150
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,344
This is bad...

151
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,889
Now that Shiin knows the villagers
won't abandon their homes and get out,

152
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,433
he'll use his last resort.

153
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:11,273
There is a dam built upriver to secure
water resources during a drought.

154
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:16,361
There is enough water for the village
to last a year, even if it doesn't rain.

155
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,364
The dam has been rigged to blow up

156
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,784
and to sweep away
the entire village with a flood.

157
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,330
All they care about
is the mine.

158
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,000
We can't stop something like a flood

159
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,461
unless we move mountains
or something!

160
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,545
Mountains...

161
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,382
That's it.
We should move mountains!

162
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,052
Naruto! Take me to the mine.

163
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,345
Wha...?

164
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,599
There should be a bunch of
Letter Bombs in the mine!

165
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,769
Letter Bombs?!
What're you going to do with those?!

166
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,938
I'm going to blow up
the mine itself.

167
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,149
The crumbled dirt and sand will
fill up the valley

168
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,234
and the flood can be stopped.

169
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,827
Damn it! He's started!
Let's hurry, Menma!

170
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:10,332
Naruto... There's something
I have to tell you.

171
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,083
Make it later!

172
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,003
I haven't lost my memory.

173
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,633
Yeah... But stopping
the flood comes first!

174
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,594
No, I'd like you to listen now.

175
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:28,016
I lost my parents when I was little
and was raised in Shiin's clan.

176
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,063
They were a small Shinobi clan even
in the Land of Rice Paddies.

177
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,984
But they still had ambitious plans...

178
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,071
However, a Shinobi village was created
in the Land of Rice Paddies

179
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,822
about a year ago.

180
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,158
It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.

181
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,619
The Village Hidden in the Sound!

182
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,914
Clan members confident in their skill

183
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,708
drifted over to Hidden Sound Village
one after another.

184
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,255
Eventually jobs from
the feudal lord stopped coming.

185
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,552
Shiin the leader of the clan that
had lost its means of livelihood

186
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,346
set his eyes on the mine in this village...

187
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,227
The plan was to just threaten
and chase off the villagers.

188
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,440
But I encountered
unexpected resistance,

189
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,402
and I got scared and tried to escape...

190
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,157
What're you hesitating for?
Hurry up and take care of him.

191
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,451
Father! Father!

192
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,124
Stop it!

193
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,837
You... You jerk!

194
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,549
Look out!

195
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,727
I'm a member of a clan that
has committed crimes.

196
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,105
It would've been better if
I'd just died like that...

197
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,859
How easy things would've been
if I could've died then...

198
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,574
I got scared thinking about
the villagers who died...

199
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,327
I wanted to forget.

200
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,289
And so I cowardly escaped into
a Jutsu passed down through the clan

201
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,416
that erases memory.

202
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,086
However, the Jutsu didn't work
very well...

203
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:26,301
I only temporarily lost my memory
and it came back in a few hours.

204
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,559
Then you had your memory
the whole time?!

205
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,810
I'm sorry...

206
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,812
Knock it off!

207
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:42,651
Then why didn't you tell me about
that honestly from the start?!

208
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,110
If you had, it would've been...

209
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,239
I didn't have the courage to make
the crimes of the clan public.

210
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,621
But I thought the clan must
not commit any further crimes.

211
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,085
So I pretended to lose
my memory.

212
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,713
And to prevent the clan from
adding to their crimes...

213
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,259
I wanted to bring some of you
Leaf Shinobi here

214
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,053
and have you help out.

215
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,972
I knew of Shiin's next plan.

216
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,310
There must not be any
more village casualties.

217
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,107
Stopping that is my duty
for having survived.

218
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,316
Duty...?

219
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,528
I needed the help
of the Leaf Shinobi

220
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:31,241
before Shiin could
execute his next plan...

221
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,664
I wanted to round them all up
during the attack earlier.

222
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,292
But since things have come this far,
I'll stop the flood.

223
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,004
Thanks, Naruto...

224
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,303
I leave Shiin to you.
Find and stop him, no matter what.

225
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,348
You... This...?

226
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,933
This is goodbye.

227
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,353
Somebody has to blow up
the Letter Bombs inside...

228
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,481
If you do that, you'll...!

229
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:07,777
Thanks to you, my life has
taken on more meaning...

230
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,496
What's that sound?

231
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,167
There are intermittent explosions
occurring upriver...

232
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,420
The village will be engulfed in
a mudslide if the dam breaks!

233
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,838
No...!

234
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,922
Neji...

235
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,439
It's coming!

236
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,121
Goodbye...

237
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,998
Naruto...

238
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:07,962
Menma!

239
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,261
Wh-What happened...?

240
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,224
It seems the crumbled mountain
stopped the mudslide...

241
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,352
Then, that means the village is saved?

242
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,436
Yeah...

243
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,938
– Thank goodness!
– That's a relief...

244
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,456
H-How can that be?!

245
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,835
Menma!!

246
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,884
That jerk...!

247
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,596
He won't get away!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

248
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,017
Hold it!

249
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,980
Interfering with our plan!

250
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,278
You think such a Jutsu will work
on me... Huh?!

251
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,200
Die!

252
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,123
I'll stop you in Menma's place!

253
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,083
What?!

254
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,085
Rasengan!

255
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,435
He sacrificed his life to save
the village, huh...?

256
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,439
No matter what his past was,
he was a good guy at heart...

257
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,357
Mister...

258
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,653
I wanted to say a word of apology.

259
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:59,157
Not being able to remember
anything until the end

260
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,910
might have been salvation for him...

261
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,510
It was a promise, right?
To eat this with you.

262
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,889
You don't need
to say anything to him?

263
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,517
He'll be fine if he has an appetite.
I know how he is.

264
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,354
He'll overcome it on his own
as time passes.

265
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:34,609
For a while he'll probably remember
each time he eats ramen...

266
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,944
That's fine.

267
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,988
People can get stronger
precisely because

268
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,782
they have feelings
that are never forgotten...

269
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,868
That's what's called growth.

270
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,002
Damn... This is good!

271
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,095
Menma...

272
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:10,019
The Key to the rusted heart's door

273
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:15,858
Will always be smiling right near by

274
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:26,285
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

275
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:30,873
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

276
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,420
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

277
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:40,425
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

278
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,388
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

279
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,892
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

280
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:54,188
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

281
00:21:54,272 --> 00:22:01,112
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

282
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:05,616
The wind is probably testing our hearts

283
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,413
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

284
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:15,251
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

285
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,048
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

286
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

287
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,183
Will always be smiling right near by

288
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,400
The Village Hidden in the Sand
requested an auxiliary force?

289
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,611
Ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials

290
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,780
took one of Sand Village's Ninja
candidates as a hostage

291
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,240
and escaped towards
the Land of Fire.

292
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,867
Presently, Gaara and others
are chasing them.

293
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,952
That means an ambush, doesn't it?

294
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,496
I will leave the strategy up to you.

295
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,041
Take some Genin you can use
and leave within half an hour.

296
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,125
That's all.

297
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,543
– Hold on please.
– What is it?

298
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,337
Let me borrow Sakura.

299
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,548
Next time: "The Targeted Shukaku"
