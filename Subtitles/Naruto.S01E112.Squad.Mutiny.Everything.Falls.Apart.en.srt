1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:20,354
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:24,608
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,779
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:34,160
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,165
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:44,378
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:49,300
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,470
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,016
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,603
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,197
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,700
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,210
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,963
and melting away

17
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,219
Byakugan!

18
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,103
Caught 'em!

19
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,774
All right! All right!
I'll drag Sasuke back without fail!

20
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,443
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,

21
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,780
but I'm gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!

22
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,448
Me, too!

23
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,284
Don't be so hasty.

24
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,453
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy...

25
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,998
we'll make direct contact
with the target!

26
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,921
It looks like they haven't
noticed us yet.

27
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,175
Huh? Sasuke isn't there.

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,596
It appears that...

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640
he's inside that "coffin."

30
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,167
What's this?

31
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,086
I poked the bush for kicks

32
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,839
and out comes not even a snake,
but just two bugs.

33
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,677
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,971
We didn't come here to fight.

35
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,932
We just came here to negotiate!

36
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,060
Huh, then...
What are they?!

37
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,038
There's no point
to that Smoke Bomb.

38
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,624
You can't run away from me.

39
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,086
It's string that's thinner and stronger
than wire that you can hardly see.

40
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,048
My string is placed all over this place.

41
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,052
Darn.

42
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,932
Those two types of wires
on the trap were on purpose...

43
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,476
It was actually a triple trap.

44
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,229
Darn.

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,943
Didn't think they had one
with such ability in the group...

46
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,114
You will be...!

47
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,201
What's going on...? My body...

48
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,165
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

49
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,044
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,341
But... There is one with
ability like this, too.

51
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,594
Thanks for getting caught so nicely
in my strategy.

52
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,682
Darn... But...

53
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,935
I have this kind of ability, too.

54
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,522
Where did it come from?

55
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,400
Earth Style Barrier!

56
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,319
Earth Dome Prison!

57
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,084
Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!

58
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,896
Darn!
Where is this?

59
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,816
Inside of that big guy's barrier.

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,322
Darn!

61
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,709
These guys are mine.
I want to recover as much as possible.

62
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,379
Once you're done eating,
catch up with us,

63
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,672
we're going ahead.

64
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,723
Come quickly.

65
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,769
Let us out! You!

66
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,604
Be quiet, Naruto!

67
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,568
From the looks of it,
it just looks like a dirt wall...

68
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:06,033
It's their Jutsu,
there must be some kind of trap.

69
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,745
I don't know what it's made of,

70
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,414
but we're just going to
have to tear this wall down!

71
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,334
Even though
it's dangerous to be careless,

72
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,004
actually it's more dangerous
to remain silent here.

73
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,888
Tunneling Fang!

74
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,292
The wall is restoring itself...

75
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,131
Hey...

76
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,257
I saw that.

77
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,176
Let us out!

78
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,767
It's not just a dirt wall, after all.

79
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,215
Byakugan!

80
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,141
Th-This is...

81
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,643
What is it? What's happening?

82
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,499
This is bad.
Chakra's getting sucked up...

83
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:30,219
Darn... I didn't expect that
they would just keep us in the barrier,

84
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,013
but I didn't predict that
they would suck our Chakra either.

85
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:46,610
Man. How dare they!
Let us out of here already!

86
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,392
I've had a good amount of Chakra.
Thank you for the meal.

87
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,243
I feel like my body energy
is being sucked out.

88
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,964
It won't be good if
we stay like this here, Shikamaru.

89
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,467
It was careless to get caught

90
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,512
before we even figured out
our enemy's powers.

91
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,889
On top of all that...inside here.

92
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,983
Darn! I'm going to make an air hole
before all my Chakra is gone!

93
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,067
Akamaru!

94
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,779
The Food Pills!

95
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,005
Akamaru!
Human Mimicry Ninja Art!

96
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,550
And for me,
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!

97
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,316
Fang Over Fang!

98
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,241
All right! Good going, Kiba.

99
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,759
It's useless...

100
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,945
Darn! It starts to restore
the moment it's hit.

101
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,491
Same with the ground.

102
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,810
At this rate, we won't be able to
keep up for another ten minutes.

103
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,271
We'll lose all our Chakra
and be totally annihilated...

104
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,418
I can't use the Rasengan that
requires extremely difficult Chakra control

105
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,754
especially in a place like this
that sucks the Chakra out of us.

106
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,300
Darn!

107
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,835
Hey, I want you to listen to me!
I want to talk to your leader.

108
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:20,008
We won't go after Sasuke anymore,
so let us out of here!

109
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,259
Hey...

110
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,137
Shikamaru, what are you saying?

111
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,308
Pleading for your life,
how interesting...

112
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:34,314
But you guys are my prey,
I can't let you out.

113
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:40,278
Then...just let me out on my own.

114
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,410
This battle...

115
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,664
is such a pain.

116
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,459
You! Do you know
what you're saying?

117
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,547
Shut up, Kiba, be quiet...

118
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,298
What?!

119
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,010
A split in the group, huh?

120
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,348
Seems like you're the leader, but...

121
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,850
I didn't think you would be
the only one begging for your life!

122
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,856
You really see a human's true nature
when one is pushed to the edge of death.

123
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,276
You're such a low-life creature,

124
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,822
you're not qualified to be responsible
for the lives of your platoon members.

125
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,122
I've saved the most
important thing for last...

126
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,501
To abandon Sasuke and
to even sell out on your own platoon...

127
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,337
Is that what it means
to be a Chunin of the Leaf?

128
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,467
Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

129
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,052
He is a comrade!

130
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,346
Therefore, I will put my life on the line
to help him!

131
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,223
That's the way of the Leaf Village.

132
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,769
Someone like you deserves to die...
I won't let you out.

133
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,107
Shikamaru! I believed in you,
but now I've lost confidence in you!

134
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,275
Let's take this outside!

135
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,319
Hey, we can't get out!
You fool!

136
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,654
That's why we're in this situation!

137
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,822
What do you mean by "fool"?

138
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,073
I'm just speaking the truth, fool!

139
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,658
Oh! You said "fool" again!

140
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,369
Everybody, be quiet for a second!

141
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,207
Choji?

142
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,434
Now he's squatting down.
What is he thinking?

143
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,942
Hey! Why are you eating snacks
all of a sudden?!

144
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,612
Choji binge eats when he gets upset...

145
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,365
Geez, another useless guy.

146
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,368
It can't be helped!
In this case, Shadow Clone...!

147
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,577
Stop it.

148
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,082
The enemy's Chakra is placed
all over that wall.

149
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,294
Even if you are able to scratch it,
the wall will restore itself right away.

150
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,298
In other words, it's useless
unless we can attack it

151
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,052
with a Taijutsu that has enough power
to destroy this wall with one blow.

152
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,472
Somebody that has a Taijutsu
with greater destructive power than mine

153
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,140
would be Choji, but...

154
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,602
At this rate...

155
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,696
Darn, what do we do!

156
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,827
Neji... I'm sorry, but can you use
the rest of the Chakra you have

157
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,873
to observe the wall behind you
and the wall behind Choji?

158
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,293
I got it.
Shikamaru! You be quiet!

159
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,628
Naruto!

160
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,296
You still don't understand?!

161
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,508
Remember what Shikamaru said
when he gathered everyone!

162
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:55,765
Even I can't just sit back
and be a sluggard.

163
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,018
Because I'm responsible
for your lives.

164
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,440
Choji, don't raise your voice
too much from here.

165
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,194
Kiba, dent that wall
behind Neji and Choji again!

166
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,280
Y-Yeah...

167
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,284
Huh! I don't fully understand
what's going on,

168
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,869
but I'll go wild one more time!

169
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,414
Tunneling Fang!

170
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,422
Huh! No matter how hard you try,
it's useless!

171
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,823
Huh, I see...

172
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,033
It's over there.

173
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,454
Neji!

174
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,874
Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.

175
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,418
Choji, are you ready?!

176
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,004
Okay! Any time!

177
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,423
All right, let's do this.

178
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,592
What's happening?!

179
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:18,681
Like I said earlier,
the wall's surface is planted with Chakra.

180
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:25,480
But even this tough wall could have
an area that have a thin layer of Chakra.

181
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,066
That is what Shikamaru speculated.

182
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,278
How...How did you get all of that?

183
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,240
Think about what happened earlier.

184
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,160
Because he noticed that
there were areas that restored quickly

185
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,288
and others that didn't so quickly

186
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,667
when Kiba and Akamaru attacked
the wall surface.

187
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,801
In other words, he guessed that
those areas that didn't restore quickly

188
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,845
probably has a thin layer
of Chakra.

189
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:03,726
On top of all that,
by cleverly talking to the enemy,

190
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,062
he figured out the position
of the enemy outside of the wall.

191
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,777
He guessed that
the wall furthest from the enemy

192
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,447
probably had the thinnest point
of Chakra,

193
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,242
so that's what he wanted to confirm.

194
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,078
That's what it is, correct?

195
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,878
I see, in order to trick the enemy,
you must trick your friends first.

196
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,007
I didn't see that there was
such a plan behind that conversation.

197
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,052
Then, Choji realized the plan

198
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,306
and the reason why he was eating
was to replenish his Chakra.

199
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,350
These two...

200
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,271
They haven't been working together
as a team all these years for nothing.

201
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,232
I'm depending on you, Choji.
Yeah!

202
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,737
Expansion Jutsu!

203
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,865
All right, let's go!

204
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,750
Human Boulder!

205
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,274
What?!

206
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:58,591
Choji... You are awesome, after all!

207
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,650
Once in a long while,

208
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,278
once in a while

209
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:24,909
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

210
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:30,248
Look like a mountain

211
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,838
Clinging to the Divine,

212
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,758
clinging to Buddha

213
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:46,472
The remnants of a person crying

214
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,643
Look like a mountain

215
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,814
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

216
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

217
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,946
Shake shake shake
Let's look

218
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

219
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:20,840
Look like a mountain

220
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,928
Look like a mountain

221
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,515
Look like a mountain

222
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,936
Look like a mountain

223
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,817
Huh? What are you saying
all of a sudden, Choji!

224
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,611
There's no way that's possible!

225
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,196
But, Choji is right.

226
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,281
If we keep lagging, we won't be able
to catch up with Sasuke.

227
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,076
But still...
Don't worry. I have an idea.

228
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,577
Choji, are you possibly thinking...

229
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,162
Do you have a plan or something?

230
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,455
Yeah.
Hey! Choji!

231
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,042
That's right!
I have that secret weapon of mine!

232
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,462
Next time:
"Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!"

233
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,381
I'm the one who will defeat that guy!
