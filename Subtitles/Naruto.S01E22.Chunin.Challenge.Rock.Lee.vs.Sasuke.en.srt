1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,270
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,494
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,331
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,799
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,718
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,932
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,904
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,952
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,417
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,087
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,972
Hey, you there.

21
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,390
Identify yourself.

22
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,351
I'm not obliged to answer...

23
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,685
What...?!

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,605
Cute...

25
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,530
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats...

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,867
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.

27
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,910
Yeah...

28
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,498
It appears this year's
test-takers will be amusing.

29
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,751
For us proctors too, eh...

30
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,296
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!

31
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,674
Don't pull.

32
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,851
Sasuke... Sasuke Uchiha, eh.

33
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,816
Does that kid concern you?

34
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,900
Hmph...

35
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,616
Lee, let's go.

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,826
What're you doing?

37
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,453
You guys go on ahead.

38
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,039
I have something I want to check out.

39
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,918
What's that about?

40
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,169
Why should I know?

41
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,220
You, with the unpleasant look.
Wait a minute!

42
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:00,764
Huh?

43
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,396
– Oh!
– Yikes!

44
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,941
What is it?

45
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,903
Why don't you fight with me
here now?

46
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,782
Chunin Challenge:
Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,246
A fight here now...?

48
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,247
Yes.

49
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,131
My name's Rock Lee.

50
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,092
When asking a person their name,

51
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,094
I'm supposed to give
my own name first, right?

52
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,096
Sasuke Uchiha...

53
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,099
Hmph... So you knew?

54
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,519
I want to fight with you!

55
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,524
I want to test out how effective
my techniques will be

56
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,612
against the descendant of the
clan reputed for genius Ninjas.

57
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,364
Also...

58
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,996
Sakura. Love.

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,460
Noooo!
Those lower eyelashes are awful!

60
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,253
The hairstyle is awful, too!

61
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,256
Those bushy eyebrows,
just too intense!

62
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,466
Everything is...!

63
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,802
You're an angel!

64
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,640
Noooooo!

65
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,270
You are good at it.
Then, how about...?

66
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,164
Really... That was super close.

67
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,960
You! Don't throw strange stuff!

68
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,337
I was dodging for my life!

69
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,174
You don't have to resent me that much.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,178
It's Sasuke again!
Darn it! Darn it!

71
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,432
To be honest, you're a naive one,

72
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,102
knowing the name of Uchiha
and challenging me.

73
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,649
Do you want to realize
what this name is, Bushy-Brow?

74
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,986
I insist.

75
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,404
I'm lucky...

76
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,324
to be able to have a bout with
the number one rookie right away.

77
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,120
And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!

78
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,330
Wait!

79
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,259
I AM going to take out
the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!

80
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,012
Hey, you...!

81
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,013
Big deal.

82
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,223
I'll be able to take care of him
in just five minutes!

83
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:52,728
The one I want to fight isn't you...
It's Uchiha.

84
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,689
All these people...

85
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,275
keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.
How annoying!

86
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,540
Darn it!

87
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,251
Leaf Whirlwind!

88
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,719
As I thought, he's strong...

89
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:32,184
I declare. You are absolutely
no match for me.

90
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,685
Because...

91
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,608
among the Leaf Village Genin,
I'm the strongest now.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,408
He stopped my kick...

93
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,911
What's with that Chakra in his arm...?

94
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,542
Interesting. I'll do it.

95
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,212
Oh...

96
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,424
Stop! Sasuke!

97
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,970
There's less than thirty minutes
until the 3:00 registration.

98
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,597
Don't worry.

99
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,308
It'll be over in five minutes.

100
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,727
Here he comes!

101
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,689
I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.

102
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,108
I may end up breaking the taboo.

103
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,485
I may end up using...
that technique!

104
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,782
Leaf Hurricanes!

105
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,163
I can't get completely out
of the way... Guard!

106
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,999
What...?!

107
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,917
Sasuke!

108
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,345
W-What's going on?

109
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,850
But...he did guard himself
just now, no mistake.

110
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,770
He got around my guard.

111
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,688
What is it?

112
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,316
Is it Ninjutsu...?
Or is it Genjutsu...?!

113
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,028
As I thought, he's going to get up!

114
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,280
Hmph... That's okay.

115
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,157
If that's the case,

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,701
this is a good opportunity
to get used to THAT.

117
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,205
I'll do it.

118
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,379
Huh?! C-Could that be...?

119
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:26,882
Sharingan!

120
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,720
Sasuke, when has he...
Why is that in his eyes...

121
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,348
And in both eyes...!

122
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,975
Is that the Sharingan?

123
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,486
Sasuke's awesome, after all!

124
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,323
If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei's...

125
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,825
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!

126
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,787
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu...

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,583
It's some kind of magic either way...
I'll reveal that!

128
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,381
It feels like Sasuke's rapidly
getting stronger.

129
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,427
That's to be expected
of the Uchiha clan.

130
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,017
That's right...
Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.

131
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,108
Huh?! The Sharingan...!

132
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,820
To not be able to discern the Jutsu
with the Sharingan...

133
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,572
Could it be...that his technique is...!

134
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:34,825
That's right...

135
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,953
My technique is neither
Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.

136
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,127
S-Sasuke!

137
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,050
That's right!

138
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,472
My technique is
mere Taijutsu...Sasuke.

139
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,227
You may not be able to
believe it just like that, but...

140
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,353
Punk!

141
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,067
It's said that the Sharingan
has the ability to spot

142
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,363
all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.

143
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,824
Make no mistake,

144
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,868
the Sharingan reads Ninjutsu and Genjutsu

145
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,704
that require the principle of building up
Chakra and weaving Signs,

146
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,165
and can most surely handle such Jutsu.

147
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,669
However, only Taijutsu is
a little bit different...

148
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,838
W-What do you mean?!

149
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,300
Even if you can spot my movements
with the Sharingan,

150
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,305
your body is not equipped with
the speed to respond to my Taijutsu.

151
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,059
In other words, even if you understand
with your eyes,

152
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,103
there's nothing you can do if your
body can't keep up.

153
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,981
Do you know?

154
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,194
There are two types of strong people,
genius-types and effort-types.

155
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,698
If your Sharingan is
a genius-type drawing Uchiha ability...

156
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:01,161
I'm an effort-type who has
patiently mastered only Taijutsu.

157
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,705
In a manner of speaking,

158
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,585
your Sharingan and my ultimate
Taijutsu have the worst compatibility...

159
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,795
Guard!

160
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,809
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow...!

161
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,770
And I shall prove it with this technique.

162
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,192
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.

163
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,236
W-What's he going to do...?!

164
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,197
It's my victory!

165
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,623
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!

166
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,584
And I shall prove it with this technique.

167
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,631
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.

168
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,550
W-What's he going to do...?!

169
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,511
It's my victory!

170
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,763
Huh?!

171
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,017
– Huh?
– Huh?!

172
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,436
That's...!

173
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,688
That's as far as it goes! Lee!

174
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,362
W-What is it...?
What's going on?

175
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,990
Sasuke!

176
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,667
Sasuke was beaten?!

177
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,087
What happened while
I was knocked out?!

178
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,759
Are you okay?! Sasuke.

179
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,721
He's agitated...

180
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,141
To think he couldn't fall properly.

181
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,519
Y-You were watching...?

182
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,065
Lee! That technique just now
is prohibited, you know!

183
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,028
W-What's with that turtle...?

184
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,490
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

185
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,743
He's...getting scolded or something...

186
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:10,499
Could that be...Bushy-Brow's teacher?!

187
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,797
B-But, of course,

188
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:23,386
I didn't even remotely have
a mind to use the Hidden technique...

189
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,597
There's no mistake!

190
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,806
– Huh?
– Huh?

191
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,850
Hey-hey.

192
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,768
What...?

193
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,813
That thing... It's a turtle, right...?
Right?

194
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,732
Isn't it obvious?!

195
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,028
Say! Say! Can even a turtle
become a Ninja teacher?

196
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,571
I don't know!

197
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,864
Fool!

198
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,410
You think such subterfuge will work?!

199
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,164
You should know very well what
it means

200
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,251
for a Shinobi to give away
his technique!

201
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,461
I...I know.

202
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,300
To think I lost to someone so flippant...

203
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,266
Have you prepared yourself?

204
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,725
Y-Yes sir...

205
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,938
All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!

206
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,362
Man! Life treating you good, huh?

207
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,655
Huh?!

208
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:29,536
Whoaaa! An even more
intense guy has appeared!

209
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,829
Yo, Lee!

210
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,875
Super intense.
The extreme bowl cut...

211
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,461
T-Those are some incredibly
raging brows...

212
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,548
I've never seen anything like that
in my life.

213
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,262
H-Hey! You guys!
Don't mock Guy Sensei!

214
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,431
Shut up!

215
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,141
I'm at a loss for a reaction because

216
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,767
of those bizarre things appearing
one after another!

217
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,144
What?!

218
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,353
Hey, Lee! Drop it!

219
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,815
Yes, sir...

220
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,279
Idiot!

221
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,502
Lee, you...you...

222
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,296
S-Sensei...!

223
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,758
L-Lee...

224
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,763
Sensei...I...I...

225
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,224
Enough, Lee!
Don't say anything!

226
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,935
Sensei!

227
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,187
Lee!

228
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,194
I lost to a guy like that...

229
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,197
Yes...this is adolescence!

230
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,990
Sensei!

231
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,538
That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.

232
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,124
I-Idiot! That's dangerous!
Very dangerous!

233
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,878
It's okay, Lee!

234
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,048
Mistakes come with adolescence.
Don't worry about it!

235
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,551
You're so kind...Sensei!

236
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,931
Now then, take a hundred laps
around the Training Field

237
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,140
toward that setting sun!

238
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,017
Yes! Sensei!

239
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,614
Let's go!

240
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,907
Yes, sir!

241
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,868
Hey, wait a minute.

242
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,204
We're still in the middle
of the conversation!

243
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,289
What're you going to do
about the Chunin Exam?!

244
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,749
There's no time!

245
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,586
Huh? Oh, that's right...

246
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,174
Lee, you will be punished for attempting

247
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,178
to break the prohibition on top of fighting...
in principle,

248
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,556
-after the Chunin Exam.
-Okay!

249
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,684
Five hundred howls of adolescence!

250
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,893
Yes, sir!

251
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,481
Idiots...

252
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,983
Say! Say!

253
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,235
By the way, what's with that turtle?

254
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,239
If I'm not mistaken, those kids are...

255
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,532
Kakashi's...

256
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,202
Oh! No, he's looking this way!

257
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,248
You guys...how's Kakashi Sensei?

258
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,916
You know Kakashi...?

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,918
I know him all too well.

260
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,797
People call us...

261
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,259
eternal rivals.

262
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,261
Sounds like a lie!

263
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,222
What're you saying?!
Guy Sensei really is...

264
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,432
That's fine.

265
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,602
Action speaks louder than words
anyway.

266
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,149
Huh?!

267
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,614
By the way, my record is fifty wins
and forty-nine losses.

268
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,115
-Huh?!
-This guy...

269
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,576
When did he...?

270
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,623
One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi...

271
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,542
N-No way...

272
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:09,506
He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!
Is he human...?!

273
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,967
How about that?!
Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!

274
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,761
Darn it...

275
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,096
This time around,
Lee caused the trouble.

276
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,933
Out of consideration for my face,
forgive him.

277
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,685
Out of consideration for
this pleasant face.

278
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,563
He's better than that Kakashi...?

279
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,150
Darn it! He's...

280
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,194
not just all talk...

281
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:36,616
You guys and Lee should probably go
to the classroom pretty soon.

282
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,708
He...!

283
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,174
Then, do your best, Lee!
Farewell!

284
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,175
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,176
What?!

286
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,347
Sasuke...

287
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,308
I have one last thing to tell you.

288
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:08,273
I actually came here to
verify my own ability.

289
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,735
I lied before.

290
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,948
The strongest man of the
Leaf Village Genin

291
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,700
might be on my team.

292
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,165
I'm entering in order
to defeat that person.

293
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,377
And, you are one of my targets.

294
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,215
Please prepare yourself for the Exam!

295
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,351
Sasuke...

296
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,563
Ha! So...

297
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,317
I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?

298
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,234
Naruto!

299
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,237
Shut up!

300
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,574
I'll knock him flat next time!

301
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,993
Ha! That from someone
who just got whipped.

302
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,204
Hey...what's your problem?!
Naruto, you!

303
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,379
You saw it, didn't you? His hand...

304
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,220
That Bushy-Brow probably did a heck
of a lot of special training.

305
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,764
Day after day...

306
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,266
More than you have...

307
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,229
That's all it is.

308
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,153
Sasuke...

309
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,582
Interesting...

310
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,543
Hmph!

311
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,632
It's starting to get interesting...
the Chunin Exam!

312
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,509
What's next?

313
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,721
-Yeah!
-All right!

314
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,560
Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!

315
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,645
Yeah!

316
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,625
Whoaaaa!
There are tons of people here!

317
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,835
Are they all here to take
the Chunin Exam?

318
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,545
Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba,

319
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,422
Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?

320
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,216
So you're all here, too?

321
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,052
Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!

322
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,931
Open up your eyes and watch me
become the Hokage!

323
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:14,102
Next episode: Genin Takedown!
All Nine Rookies Face Off!

324
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,813
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
