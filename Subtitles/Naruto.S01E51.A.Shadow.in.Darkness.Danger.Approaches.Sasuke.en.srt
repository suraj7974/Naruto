1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,903
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,295
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,089
Now

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,748
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,429
Now, let the tenth round begin.

19
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,264
Do your best!

20
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,432
Fatso!

21
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,521
Damn it!
Those two better watch out!

22
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:48,108
I'll end this match quickly and
turn you into mincemeat!

23
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,694
Then let's not play around...

24
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,614
I'll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.

25
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,077
You bandaged cucumber roll!

26
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,166
I know his Achilles heel all too well
from my last battle with him.

27
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,379
Those holes in his arm emit
a pulsing sound, so...

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,215
Ninja Art!
Expansion Jutsu!

29
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,718
Followed by the
Hidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!

30
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,016
All I have to do is to prevent him
from aiming at my ears!

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,352
Human Boulder Jutsu!

32
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,106
Hooray for Big-Boned!

33
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,649
Good!

34
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,235
Squash him, Choji!

35
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,199
This guy can attack sonically without
even touching the opponent...

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,952
But that's only when ears are showing!

37
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,914
With Choji's whole head buried,
it's like he's wearing ear plugs.

38
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,584
how does anyone make a sonic attack
on a meat ball,

39
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,252
let alone one that's rolling?

40
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,968
The way you are...
you can barely move, can you?

41
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,928
That's where I attack!

42
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,890
It's no use, I'm wearing ear plugs.

43
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,475
No, this is the end!

44
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,687
Oh?!

45
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,701
The human body is made up of 70% water,
and water is able to transmit sound waves.

46
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,873
In other words, your whole body is like
one big ear.

47
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,295
And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!

48
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:39,094
Lord Orochimaru...no, Orochimaru!

49
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:44,725
I'll have you know that...
I'm more than a mere guinea pig.

50
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,685
Are you all right?

51
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,687
I-I want to eat meat...

52
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,398
Oh man...
And the guy went easy on him, too.

53
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,195
Although he lost, the least we can
do for him is take him for some BBQ beef.

54
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,658
It's finally over.

55
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,994
At long last, the Final Round...

56
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:09,833
With this, the preliminaries for
the third exam is completed.

57
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,547
A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke

58
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,139
I wonder what's happened to Naruto?

59
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,893
Let's go outside now.

60
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,230
Iruka Sensei hasn't been alert recently,
so now's our chance.

61
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,481
Hey!

62
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,983
Konohamaru!

63
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,819
You intend to sneak out again, do you?

64
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,529
I-I need to go to the bathroom!

65
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,197
Liar!

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,784
To everyone who has advanced to
the Final Round

67
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,953
of the third test of the Chunin Exams,

68
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,457
there's one person who's missing,
but, congratulations.

69
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,919
Sensei...
Hmm?

70
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,131
I have a question.

71
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,634
About Sasuke?

72
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:05,014
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't know much.

73
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,391
But don't worry too much.

74
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,438
From here on, it's up to Sasuke.

75
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,693
Sakura, I have to step out
for a moment.

76
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,820
Please inquire about the
details of the Final Round!

77
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,072
Sure.

78
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,038
Here, in our house,
including Sasuke who's not here,

79
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,081
we have five Leaf,

80
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,085
three Sand,

81
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,005
and one Sound.

82
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,968
Well, I will begin the explanation
of the Final Round.

83
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,429
Finally!

84
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,396
The preliminary battles have
ended without incident.

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,273
It seems they're now entering
the Final Round.

86
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,194
This land really has become
peaceful, hasn't it?

87
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,823
This peaceful time has put
this country in slumber...

88
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:10,454
while all the other lands are busy racing
to expand their military.

89
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,374
Would it be possible for us
to take it now?

90
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,377
Humph, I suppose.

91
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:22,132
Though, I don't know how much fun
it would be to take out that old man.

92
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,635
Is that so?

93
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,267
To me, it looks like you are still have
a hesitation about it.

94
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,978
From now on, the power of
each Hidden Village will clash

95
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,397
with one another in a long
and violent manner.

96
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,817
The Sound village is also one of them...

97
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,529
You intend to be the trigger
for all of that...

98
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,743
And use him for a bullet.

99
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:53,288
Our Sasuke...right?

100
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,126
You guess well.

101
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,919
So well that it's a bit creepy.

102
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,296
Not in the slightest.

103
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,300
I still had no idea about
Dosu, Zaku or Kin.

104
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,470
In gathering information on Sasuke,

105
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,889
I desired to learn their skills

106
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,349
and carried out tactless things like

107
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,935
deliberately subjecting myself to an attack.

108
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,355
You overestimated me.

109
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,483
It seems that you...

110
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,113
you don't trust me completely...yet.

111
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,659
Was it necessary to tell you,
my right-hand man,

112
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,162
about the likes of those three?

113
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,623
You see, therein lies
the very proof of my trust.

114
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,713
And because I do...

115
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,720
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.

116
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,806
The Curse Mark that was given to him...

117
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,059
appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.

118
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,438
Though, that won't matter much.

119
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,191
While there is still some
darkness left in his heart...

120
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,402
I want you to abduct him.

121
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,615
That's an uncharacteristically
hasty request, is it not?

122
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,118
There's a little something troubling me...

123
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,788
Is it Naruto Uzumaki?

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,544
You're quite a sharp one,
aren't you?

125
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:29,259
Sasuke has lived for revenge
against his older brother Itachi,

126
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,554
and will not rest until he
has achieved that aim.

127
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,682
Nevertheless, in battle with me,

128
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,018
he was aware that there were things
beyond his power and

129
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,062
faced death without fear.

130
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,941
I didn't think he'd be the type of
person who would be in a hurry to die.

131
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,485
According to your information,

132
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:53,408
contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has
altered Sasuke's heart and mind.

133
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:57,537
So much so, that he possesses
some influence over Sasuke.

134
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,917
The best thing to do is to get Sasuke
away from him immediately...

135
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:07,756
And quickly turn him in my color.

136
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,099
Well, then...

137
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,809
Kabuto...
You...

138
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,939
If you wish to stop me...

139
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,033
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.

140
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,871
You can't possibly kill me...

141
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:44,459
Though you are strong, you're only
in the same league as Kakashi.

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,763
Just kidding...

143
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,974
Now, run along.

144
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,351
I trust you.

145
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,193
That face...

146
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,821
I wonder what could possibly
be going on in his head?

147
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,824
The Final Round is where
each one of you

148
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,368
will show off your battle skills
in front of everyone.

149
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,163
I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate
and show off your ability

150
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,499
as representative battle forces
of your respective lands.

151
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,212
Accordingly, the Final Round will
commence one month from now.

152
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,965
W-We're not going to
do it here, right now?

153
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,719
This is so that there's
a suitable period of preparation.

154
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,971
What do you mean?

155
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,348
That is to say...

156
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,808
Along with the announcement of
the conclusion

157
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,853
of the preliminary match to each
country's Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,

158
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,774
readying the summons for
Final Round requires preparation time-

159
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:54,196
not to mention the time it takes
for you examinees to prepare.

160
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,908
This old man always has such
a roundabout way of saying things.

161
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,369
I don't quite get what
you're trying to say.

162
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,703
What do you mean?

163
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,498
In other words,
in order to know your adversary,

164
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,416
in order to prepare yourself,
time is necessary.

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,503
Time to analyze what you learned about
the adversaries in the preliminaries...

166
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,339
time to take stock of your successes.

167
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,217
The battles until now were
like actual battles-

168
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,721
it presupposed situations in which
you can't know your adversary.

169
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,515
That's for sure...

170
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,560
I never dreamed that this guy
could make sand into a weapon.

171
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,980
However, this is not the case
in the Final Round.

172
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:34,569
Some of you might have already
revealed everything in front of your rivals...

173
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,280
In the spirit of fairness and equality,

174
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:42,244
you will have a month to
train yourself to further your skills.

175
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,551
Now, I can't be thinking of this

176
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,345
as some sort of month-long
holiday and do nothing! Believe it!

177
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,973
Seriously! Seriously!

178
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,069
It might not be good idea to
excel too much, is it?

179
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:21,533
We failed to stay out of Orochimaru's
watchful eye,

180
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,784
and it was unfortunate for us both.

181
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,415
Under this gentle exterior,
a seed of evil took root –

182
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,749
and it was this seed that was exploited...

183
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,003
Some day, through that Ninjutsu...

184
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,921
this child will as well...

185
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,179
Kabuto...

186
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,014
Who knows?

187
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,058
Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.

188
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,367
I have to give it you, Kakashi...

189
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,746
Stopping my attack from your blind spot...

190
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,919
But, you'd better ready at least
10 of your men next time.

191
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,926
The Anbu that I prepared were
taken out without difficulty...

192
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,554
You're not an ordinary Genin are you?

193
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,016
You caught a whiff of me and immediately
readied your weapon...

194
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,268
you're quite impressive.

195
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,729
No, I'm not all that.

196
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,981
What do you want with Sasuke?

197
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,193
Depending on circumstances,
I'll haul you off to questioning.

198
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,073
I wonder if that's possible
for the likes of you...

199
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,409
Are you looking to take me on?

200
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,793
You are the son of the chief of the
Leaf medical corps, aren't you?

201
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,838
Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?

202
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,343
Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?

203
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,681
If you arrest me here now,

204
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,767
you might never be able to prove
my connection to Orochimaru.

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,478
Shut up and confine your answers
to my questions.

206
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,939
What if I say "No"?

207
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,150
I'm the one asking the
questions around here.

208
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,277
Now give me some answers.

209
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,239
You'll find out before long anyway
if you let me go,

210
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,242
so can you make an exception
just this once?

211
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,829
You, willful little brat...

212
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,207
Don't mess around with grown-ups.

213
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,044
Don't be so arrogant.

214
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,006
The circumstances are in my favor...

215
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,825
I should have known.

216
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,495
A shadow clone!

217
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,109
Darn...I've let him escape.

218
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,200
Impressive...

219
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,456
As I suspected...

220
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,749
This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,

221
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,461
where one temporarily animates
and controls the heart of a dead body.

222
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,048
Meticulously transforming even the face...

223
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,552
and also stopping his heartbeats
and eliminating all traces of his body odor...

224
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:15,308
in order to prepare an escape by
impersonating a murdered Anbu...

225
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:20,105
He wasn't raised as the adopted son of
the chief of the medical corps for nothing.

226
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,025
If someone this good is working
for Orochimaru...

227
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,487
I can't stay as I am now...

228
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,657
Now that that's done...

229
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,827
I'd like to let you take your leave...

230
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,788
But first, for the Final Round,

231
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,749
there is one more important
matter to take care of.

232
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:44,254
Let's get on with it,
so we can get to training!

233
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,341
Now, now. I want you all to
calmly take one slip of paper

234
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,344
from the box that Anko is holding.

235
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,222
I'm going to go around in order...

236
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,808
take only one.

237
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,318
Good, everyone has taken
a number.

238
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,030
Then, from left to right, tell me
the number on your slip of paper.

239
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,574
I'm eight.

240
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,993
I'm one.

241
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,244
Seven.

242
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,370
Five.

243
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,622
Three.
Nine.

244
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,332
Two.
Six.

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,295
In other words, he has number four.

246
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,379
Uh-huh.

247
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,965
Very well, I will tell you

248
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,010
about how the Final Round
tournament will work.

249
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,179
Huh?

250
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,473
Is that what these
drawing lots were for?

251
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,851
Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.

252
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:40,977
Yes, sir.

253
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,819
He's so far away.

254
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,031
Is that all the Final Round is,
a tournament?

255
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,409
Shoot! I have one extra round.

256
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,579
Vendetta for Choji?
Give me a break!

257
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm so relieved to know that
I won't be in the same section as Gaara.

258
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,419
Sasuke Uchiha...

259
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,463
Perfect.

260
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,592
Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?

261
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,054
This couldn't be better!
Believe it!

262
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,016
Sasuke has to go up against him...?

263
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,981
Could I ask a question?
Go ahead.

264
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:31,778
Does this mean that there will
only be one winner of the tournament?

265
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:36,407
That only one of us will be
able to become a Chunin?

266
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,910
No, on the contrary.

267
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,413
The judges of the Final Round,
of which I am one,

268
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,832
will be made up of the Kazekage,

269
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,501
the Daimyo from various countries
who will assign you your missions,

270
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,921
and the Shinobi Leaders.

271
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,006
Through this tournament,

272
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,677
these judges will be able to make
a thorough evaluation,

273
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,096
and come to a decision as to
whether each one of you

274
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,849
possesses the qualities incumbent
of a Chunin.

275
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:05,937
Even if someone loses the first round,
they can still become a Chunin.

276
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,401
So there's a chance that all
of us will become Chunin?

277
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,614
Correct, but conversely,
there's also a chance that none of you will.

278
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,826
To "advance" in the tournament,

279
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,789
means maximizing chances
to appeal yourselves to the judges.

280
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,792
Understood, Shikamaru?

281
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,588
This is all a real pain in my...

282
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,090
Thank you for your patience.

283
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,551
We will adjourn until next month.

284
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,138
The second round will either be
No Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?

285
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,558
That guy is so strong he kicked
Bushy Brow's butt.

286
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,102
Sand Coffin!

287
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,403
I want to fight you, too.

288
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,244
Now that it's come to this,
I've got to see Kakashi Sensei.

289
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,332
Umm, where's the room
that Sasuke's in?

290
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,709
I'm sorry. Mr. Sasuke
is not allowed visitors.

291
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,295
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that?!

292
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,755
I'm sorry, those are the rules.

293
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,298
Why, Sis, tell me why?

294
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,217
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.

295
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,637
Kakashi Sensei!

296
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,055
Say! Say!

297
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,265
I've got a favor to ask!

298
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,017
You don't need to say it all.

299
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,561
Well, I thought it would
come to this so...

300
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,731
I searched for someone
to watch your training.

301
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,984
Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!

302
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,779
I have some matters to take care of.

303
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,948
I don't have the time to trouble
myself with you.

304
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,494
Oh! Aha...!

305
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,956
You're going to train
Sasuke, aren't you!

306
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,124
Well, don't say that.

307
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,336
I found a sensei who's
more reliable than I am!

308
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,713
Well...who is it?

309
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,424
It's me!
Huh?

310
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,179
You!
The Closet Perve!

311
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,639
Such insolence!

312
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,144
Hey, can you hear it?

313
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,897
The clear,

314
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:19,070
blue sky goes on and on

315
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,031
The ocean

316
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:28,579
spans limitlessly

317
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,207
Please keep that smile

318
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,713
on your face forever

319
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:43,177
Or else I'll cry

320
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:47,223
You won't have to search around you

321
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,185
It's all ok now.

322
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is inside

323
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,069
this hand

324
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:05,199
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

325
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,704
When you forget what happiness is

326
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,833
Just sing.

327
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,921
Light is born, and darkness was born

328
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,174
The two are one

329
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:28,014
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

330
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:33,478
Hey, can you hear it?

331
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,650
Darn! I'm not satisfied with this!

332
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,153
I don't care if you're elite tutor
or whatever,

333
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,363
but there's no way
I'm not going to get stronger

334
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,157
if I'm to learn from the Closet Perve
weaker than me!

335
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,577
I have to get strong by any
means necessary, no matter what!

336
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,080
If you're really a strong ninja,

337
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,083
just try to convince me
with your sheer strength!

338
00:22:55,917 --> 00:23:01,047
Next episode: "Ebisu Returns:
Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!"

339
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,758
I'm gonna win this time around, too!
