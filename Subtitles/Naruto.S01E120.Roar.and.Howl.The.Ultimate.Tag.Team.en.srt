1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:19,937
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,191
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,219
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,099
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:03,814
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:17,912
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,631
and melting away

14
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,384
Yahoo!

15
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,845
Roar and Howl! The Ultimate Tag-Team!

16
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,514
Got you!

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,486
Damn!

18
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,696
What's going on?!

19
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,035
I felt a response to my attack,
but it didn't work.

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,912
And where did his attack come from?

21
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,251
Listen, Akamaru.

22
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,421
We're gonna attack from both sides
with Fang Over Fang.

23
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,885
Here we go!

24
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,474
Fang Over Fang!

25
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,978
Summoning Jutsu!

26
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,823
This doesn't look so good.

27
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,327
I'll play a melody of death for you.

28
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,712
What's with this guy?

29
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,173
What?!

30
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:59,054
Two on two is perfect, right, Sakon?

31
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,316
How could the Sound Ninja Four
take so much time?

32
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,820
Did they send such strong people
after them who could hold them up...

33
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,489
or are they playing around too much?

34
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,079
Well, the one that's probably
delaying things is...

35
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:29,543
either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot,
or Kidomaru who likes to play.

36
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,295
But the one that's the most dangerous

37
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,172
when he loses his temper is Sakon.

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,885
He's not satisfied until
he kills his opponent,

39
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,762
even though he should
just leave things be.

40
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,266
He thinks he's the strongest of
the four, so he shows off.

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,686
I wonder if that's so...

42
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,607
Tayuya has a personality that's
neck and neck with Sakon.

43
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,360
But in any case, nothing bad will happen

44
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,237
since we sent that kid...

45
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,616
Kimimaro.

46
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:08,040
He'll surely clean up anything that is
not good for me.

47
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,094
I will never let you take Sasuke!

48
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,431
There's a lot of trash scattered about.

49
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,561
But after all, trash is trash.

50
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,189
It simply needs to be cleaned up.

51
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,067
Shut up!

52
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,321
Come on.

53
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,740
I'll crush you!

54
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,530
So this is the so-called melody of death.

55
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,801
So she's manipulating them
with the sound of the flute.

56
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,738
Damn! She's getting
further and further away.

57
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,741
What should I do?!
What is it that I should do?!

58
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,034
Huh?!

59
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,703
This is really looking bad!

60
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,300
Akamaru!

61
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,512
Oh, so you're the real one!

62
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,055
Multiple Fists Barrage!

63
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,644
One more!

64
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:43,237
My brother and I get along very well.

65
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,698
Usually, my older brother Ukon
sleeps inside of me,

66
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,536
but when there's a fight
he comes out and helps out.

67
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,789
This is this guy's ability.

68
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,625
Ukon can stick out
his arms and legs, his head,

69
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,045
from anywhere in my body
and attacks or defends.

70
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,713
Like this you see...

71
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,302
Multiple Legs Barrage!

72
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,353
It's a three-legged kick.
Works well, doesn't it?

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,938
So next, it's...!

74
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,734
There's no time to waste, Sakon.

75
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,160
We'll finish this quickly!
Get into the second state!

76
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,290
All right, all right...

77
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,630
You're too impatient, bro.

78
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,683
I see, you're saying those horns
aren't just for display, huh?

79
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,937
As soon as that right one came out,

80
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,356
his Chakra increased by several tenfold.

81
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,567
Shoot!

82
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,987
It seemed hopeless before,
but now it's really bad.

83
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,159
What's your liking, bro?

84
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,703
In pieces.

85
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,777
So now, perhaps it's time to get serious.

86
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,738
I'll take care of you all at once.

87
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,868
Such confident words!
But those are my lines!

88
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,878
Shoot! These guys are persistent!

89
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,423
But it's starting to get clearer to me.

90
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,974
But the problem is from here on out.

91
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,648
Damn! Am I completely out of hands?

92
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,237
What?! You're saying we're gonna do that?!

93
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,031
No, Akamaru!

94
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,243
It's too dangerous to do it here
without our comrades!

95
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,328
You understand, don't you?

96
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,497
If we use that Jutsu,

97
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,208
both you and I will use up
most of our Chakra

98
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,418
and won't be able to move.

99
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,463
If we miss, we'll die here in vain.

100
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,970
Akamaru...

101
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,607
What a pitiful master I am...
that you had to bite me.

102
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,902
I understand, Akamaru.

103
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,947
Just like you said,
we only have that left!

104
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,534
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

105
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,133
Now, Akamaru!

106
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,718
What?!

107
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,096
Do it well...Akamaru!

108
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,432
Show them the results of the training!

109
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,605
It's Dynamic Marking!

110
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,608
Playing dirty like that!

111
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,778
All preparations are done!

112
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,948
Inuzuka-Style!
Man-Beast Transformation Combo!

113
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,169
Two-Headed Wolf!

114
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,680
I wondered what it was going to be and

115
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,016
it turned out to be
a drooling runt of a dog.

116
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,185
What can a dog like this do?

117
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,648
Take this!

118
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,114
Drool?!
Sakon, what're you doing! To the right!

119
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,865
Damn!

120
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,242
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

121
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,888
Heh! How's that!

122
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,850
Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speed
is too fast.

123
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,687
It's such an intense high revolution that
even our visibility becomes zero.

124
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,606
Even without direct contact, flesh is cut...

125
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,984
A direct hit from the blow
and you're in pieces.

126
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,719
Really...getting carried away...

127
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,599
This is perfect.
We were just thinking of separating soon.

128
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,810
What?! He divided into two people?!

129
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,395
It's true...

130
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,692
Had we fully received the blow as one,
it would've been bad, but...

131
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,277
The real battle begins now.

132
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,322
Damn it...

133
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,869
Yeah... I know Akamaru.

134
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,954
One more shot of Wolf Fang Over Fang.

135
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,540
The next one is our limit.

136
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,419
We'll take them down with this!

137
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,297
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

138
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,678
It's no use hiding!

139
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,265
I told you we don't chase with our eyes!

140
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:31,102
We attack by chasing smells
we've marked with our noses!

141
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,403
– A!
– Un!

142
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,197
– Summoning...
– Summoning...

143
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,283
– Rashomon!
– Rashomon!

144
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,216
That's an impressive power...

145
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,926
To turn Rashomon,

146
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,805
the ultimate shield to protect
Lord Orochimaru into this shape.

147
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,306
But...

148
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,730
– This is the end!
– This is the end!

149
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,782
Akamaru!

150
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,743
Akamaru... To protect me, you...

151
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,831
Damn! He did it again!

152
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,207
My eyes...!

153
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,209
Damn!

154
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,589
Damn...! This time it's not ordinary piss!

155
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,675
It feels like my eyes are burning
with strong acid!

156
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,262
Where's the other one?!

157
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,346
Hey...

158
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,142
Who are you looking for?

159
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,608
I'll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.

160
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,115
This is my ability...
specialized in assassination, of course.

161
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,536
You can't beat me by
just having a good nose and nails.

162
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,914
You can't beat my ability!

163
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,794
You know that the Chakra Network
through which Chakra flows

164
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,882
is deeply interwoven with each
internal organ, right?

165
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:29,054
The Chakra Network is interwoven
in a variety of complicated ways

166
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,932
and is linked to the tissues that
make up each organ.

167
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,143
Also to each cell that makes up
the tissues,

168
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:39,648
as well as even to proteins,
which are the main component of cells...

169
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,858
At the second state,

170
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:47,280
I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells
or proteins as I wish by using Chakra.

171
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,575
To put it simply,

172
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,453
I can turn my body into tiny pieces,
enter my opponent's body...

173
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,165
return to my original form
and come back out.

174
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,209
Akamaru...

175
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,128
I'm sorry... Akamaru...!

176
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,507
We've always done things together...

177
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,676
we were together, always and everywhere.

178
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,311
Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!

179
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,651
Yahoo! We're lucky that the people
who got into our trap had Earth Scroll!

180
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,696
With our luck like this,
we'll reach the goal first.

181
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,623
Akamaru is frightened all of a sudden.

182
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,628
He can smell the strength of
an oppoenent's Chakra.

183
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,756
I've never seen him this scared...

184
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,886
The people fighting over there must
be something..

185
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:57,058
The Seventh Round Battle.
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.

186
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,770
Hey! First of all, don't you bring
a puppy in here!

187
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,188
He'll get in the way of our battle!

188
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,442
Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!

189
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,153
Now then...

190
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,697
Let's go, Akamaru!

191
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,200
Eat this!

192
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,966
There!

193
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,055
Naruto... I'm taking Akamaru back.

194
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:56,075
Wh-What?! What did you feed him?
His coating has changed to red!

195
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,579
That's why his name is Akamaru.

196
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,248
Let's go, Akamaru!

197
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,460
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art:

198
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,928
Man- Beast Clone!

199
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,265
Let's go! All-Four...

200
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,100
Jutsu!

201
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,707
An opening!

202
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,377
Take this! Man-Beast Ultimate Taijutsu!

203
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,841
Fang Over Fang!

204
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,948
Akamaru!

205
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,827
Here, Food Pills.

206
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,339
Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!

207
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,525
Fang Over Fang!

208
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,202
However, this one time, I'm sunk...

209
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:08,875
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,

210
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,419
and I can even create parts
that are only you.

211
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,547
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition.

212
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,716
A sharing of the flesh is what it'll be.

213
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,053
A sharing?

214
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:25,058
That's right...and a cruel way
of killing that only I can accomplish...

215
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,646
The gradual scraping away
of just your cells.

216
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,856
I see.

217
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,782
If that's the case...!

218
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,544
If I do this, what's gonna happen?

219
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,925
Suicide?! That's ridiculous!

220
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,096
Die with me...

221
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,314
For the first time, I spoke to you

222
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,609
And you smiled

223
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,861
For the first time, I was able to speak

224
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

225
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,742
Would you think it was

226
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,495
a bother if I approached you?

227
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:32,709
Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage

228
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,004
My clumsy attempts with words

229
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,840
You listened without turning away

230
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:44,303
No wonder I get carried away by you

231
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:50,810
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

232
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:56,858
I feel so sad

233
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,862
But...

234
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,032
For the first time, I spoke to you

235
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,826
And you smiled

236
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,787
For the first time, I was able to speak

237
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,498
In my own words

238
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,376
For the first time, I spoke to you

239
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,254
And you smiled

240
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,049
For the first time, I was able to speak

241
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,843
In my own words

242
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,556
For the first time, I spoke to you

243
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,443
What is this guy? Kekkei Genkai?!

244
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:45,573
Damn it! I've never heard
or seen this kind of technique!

245
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,867
Despite the fact that
this many are attacking him,

246
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,161
my attacks don't even faze him!

247
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:56,334
I don't know if it's
the "Five Dances" or what,

248
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,212
but I'll take care of them all!

249
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,881
Next time: "To Each His Own Battle"
