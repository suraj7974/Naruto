1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,594
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,187
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,698
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,036
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,832
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,171
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,218
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,932
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:07,026
In fighting

16
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,571
and in love

17
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,949
To the distant light above,

18
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,453
Yes, we are on the way

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,709
I wanna rock...

20
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,713
Rockin' my heart

21
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,525
What's with you?!

22
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,559
Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!

23
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,443
Good morning!

24
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,825
Here.
Thank you.

25
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,293
Naruto didn't come back
last night, either?

26
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,878
He's such a fool,

27
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,255
he's been out every night,
climbing trees.

28
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:38,010
He might be dead already
from using up too much Chakra.

29
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,804
I wonder if Naruto's okay.

30
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,474
To think a child's out in
the middle of the night.

31
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,352
Well, you don't need to worry.

32
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,480
Although he may not seem to be,
he's a full-fledged Ninja.

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,231
I wonder...

34
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:55,986
That idiot's probably
all pooped out right about now.

35
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,241
Sasuke?

36
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,703
I'm going for a walk.

37
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,706
But we're about to eat...

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,126
That was fast!

39
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,116
You'll catch a cold if
you keep sleeping here.

40
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,792
Who're you?

41
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,005
Uh...

42
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:01,135
Did you wake me up, sis?
I mean, what're you doing here?

43
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,511
I'm gathering medicinal herbs.

44
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,638
Herbs?

45
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,018
Yes. For healing injuries,
sickness and the like.

46
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,987
You got a lot to do early
in the morning, sis...

47
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,280
You, too.

48
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,158
What've you been doing
in a place like this so early?

49
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,119
Training!

50
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:34,251
Could it be that...
you're a Ninja or something?

51
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,837
What with that headband and...

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,256
Is that what I look like? Is it?

53
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,300
Yup! I'm a Ninja!

54
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,138
No kidding.
You're great, aren't you.

55
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,019
But...why are you training?

56
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,980
As for me,
I want to get stronger!

57
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,109
But, you already look
strong enough.

58
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,446
No, no! I want to get
even stronger!

59
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,201
What for?

60
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,496
To become the best Ninja
in my village!

61
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,415
I'm going to get everyone
to recognize my strength!

62
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,669
And I have to prove something
to a certain person!

63
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:24,635
Is that for the sake of somebody?
Or is it for your own sake?

64
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,720
Huh?

65
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,349
What's so funny?!

66
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,354
Do you have somebody
precious in your life?

67
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,856
Precious...?

68
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,109
What is it you want to say, sis?

69
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,211
What is it?

70
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:27,799
When a person has something
precious they want to protect...

71
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,677
that's when they can truly
become strong.

72
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:40,062
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so...

73
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:44,233
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed!

74
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,321
Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!

75
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,740
I'll kill you!!

76
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,244
Yeah! I know that well, too!

77
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,418
You'll get strong.
Yeah!

78
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:07,130
I hope we meet again somewhere.

79
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,592
Oh...and...

80
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,595
I'm a man!

81
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:18,058
That can't be!
He's cuter than Sakura.

82
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,089
Why? That's strange.

83
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,216
This world is full of mystery...

84
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,094
Ouch.
Hey! What're you doing?!

85
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,431
Did you forget about mealtime,
you idiot?

86
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,314
Naruto?

87
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,028
What in the world is Naruto doing?

88
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,531
And Sasuke hasn't come back
from his walk either...

89
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,917
No way...
Naruto can climb that high now?

90
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,502
Wow!

91
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,839
How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!

92
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,925
As for me,
I can climb this high now!

93
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,931
Whoa!

94
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,142
Oh, you idiot!
This is bad!

95
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,316
Gotcha!

96
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,028
You fell for it, you fell for it!

97
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,282
Don't scare us like that!

98
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,952
I'll kill him later! Cha!

99
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,414
He's grown a little, eh.

100
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,628
Oh! You idiot, Naruto!

101
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,380
It's cuz you went overboard!

102
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,767
You fool.

103
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,103
Sasuke...?

104
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,564
Nice, Sasuke.
You're awesome!

105
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,528
These kids are really growing.

106
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,918
Naruto...

107
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,170
Uzumaki, eh.

108
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,305
You've recovered considerably.

109
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,682
All right...

110
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,268
Just a little more, Haku.

111
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:07,853
Yes.

112
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,788
Shall we go back?

113
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,998
Okay!

114
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,754
They're late.

115
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,340
And not just Naruto,
but even Sasuke too.

116
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,805
What happened to you guys?

117
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,141
You're really muddy
and really wiped out.

118
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,688
We both...climbed up to the top.

119
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,398
Good.

120
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:59,821
Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding
Tazuna next time!

121
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,032
Got it! Whoa!

122
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,992
You idiot!

123
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,999
In just a teeny little bit,
the bridge will be complete.

124
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,834
It's thanks to you guys.

125
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,170
Even so, don't let your guard down...

126
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,966
I've really wanted to ask
you for a long time now...

127
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,430
But why are you still here
even though I lied about the mission?

128
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,019
To see what is right without doing it
bespeaks an absence of courage.

129
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,189
Like master, like man.

130
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,945
It's a teaching of the late Hokage.

131
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,473
The things I truly
hold dear to myself...

132
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,309
I'll protect until the very end
with both these arms.

133
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,565
Don't cry...Inari.

134
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,868
Why...?

135
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,330
What is it?

136
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,085
Why do you desperately work so hard
until you get like that?!

137
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,423
There's no way you'd be
a match for Gato's men even if you train!

138
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,884
No matter what cool things you say
or how much effort you make...

139
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,345
the weak always lose out...

140
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,599
against the truly strong!

141
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,858
Shut up. I'm not like you.

142
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,194
Shut up!
Looking at you makes me sick!

143
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,781
Sticking your nose in even though
you know nothing of this land!

144
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,867
I'm not like you who's always
acting frivolous

145
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,536
not knowing one thing about pain!

146
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:19,336
So you're just gonna cry
all day like the lead in a tragedy?

147
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,466
An idiot like you can just cry forever!
You crybaby!

148
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,012
Naruto! That's a bit harsh!

149
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,726
Naruto...

150
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,333
Got a minute?

151
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,719
Naruto didn't mean any harm
with what he said...

152
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,014
He's just uncouth, so...

153
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,813
We heard the story
about your father from Tazuna.

154
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:25,568
Like you, Naruto never had
a father as a young child...

155
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,447
Actually he doesn't know either
of his parents.

156
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,617
Not only that.
He didn't have a single friend.

157
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,702
What?

158
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,453
However...

159
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:39,791
I've never seen him sulk,
be timid, or cry.

160
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,339
He's always eager,
wanting to be acknowledged by someone.

161
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,719
If it's for the sake of that "dream,"
he always risks his life.

162
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:57,183
He's probably tired of crying.

163
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,486
So, he knows the true meaning
of the word strong.

164
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,365
Like your father.

165
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:17,996
Naruto might understand your feelings
the most.

166
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,332
What Naruto said earlier...

167
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:27,297
There's no mistaking that
he's told himself that over and over again.

168
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,854
Okay, then!
I leave Naruto in your hands.

169
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,234
Because he's used his body
to the limit...

170
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,821
I don't think he'll be able
to move today.

171
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,909
Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?

172
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,744
Yes, somehow.

173
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,537
We'll be going!

174
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,836
What're you doing?

175
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,839
I didn't hire you guys for charity work...

176
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,009
Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?!
Hey!!

177
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,307
Shall we go...Haku?

178
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:20,934
Yes.

179
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,200
I overslept!

180
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,162
Hey hey!! Where is everyone?

181
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,417
Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you
to rest and relax...today

182
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,628
I knew it.

183
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,588
They left me behind.

184
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,510
I'll be back.

185
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,895
Darn it!
They could've woken me up!

186
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,657
W-What the heck is this?!

187
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,834
What is going on?
What's happened?

188
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,752
It couldn't be...

189
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,006
Inari! Give me a hand.

190
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,008
Inari!?

191
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,426
I'll be right there.

192
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,860
This mist...

193
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,613
Sasuke! Sakura!
They're coming!

194
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,495
I knew he was still alive.

195
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,456
Making an appearance so soon, eh...

196
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,374
Say, Kakashi Sensei.

197
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,419
This is his...Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!

198
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,470
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.

199
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,182
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.

200
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,937
He's still trembling. Poor thing.

201
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,949
I'm trembling with...excitement.

202
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,911
Do it, Sasuke.

203
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,966
I can see it!

204
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,303
Well-well. So he could
see the Water Clones, eh.

205
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,889
That brat's grown quite a bit.

206
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,726
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

207
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,353
So it seems.

208
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,503
Phew, that was a close shave.

209
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,590
Sorry I was late.
But Inari, you were great.

210
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,844
I was able to save your mom
thanks to your courage.

211
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,179
Hey, wait a minute.

212
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,639
Doesn't the fact that
we were attacked mean

213
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,351
that Kakashi Sensei and
the others are in danger too?!

214
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,270
Next episode:
"Haku's Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors"

215
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:19,565
I'm going to kick butt once again!
