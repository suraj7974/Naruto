1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,686
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,735
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,070
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,669
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:49,884
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,051
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,819
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,755
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,346
A hot spring?

22
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,227
Yeah, just off of this road
there's a nice town with a hot spring.

23
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,479
Yunosato Hot Springs...

24
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,857
They say it does a world of good
for fatigue and beauty.

25
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,903
Aren't we going straight home?
Everyone's waiting!

26
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,822
Naruto's right.

27
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,907
Our hometown is in
a state of emergency,

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,159
there's no time to procrastinate.

29
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:00,538
It won't make much difference
if we're one or two days late...

30
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:07,211
It's really popular with girls,
and it's mixed bathing...

31
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,923
Hey?! Pervy Sage?

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,594
Sometimes it's necessary for humans
to take breathers.

33
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,847
We'll take one bath!

34
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,766
That's not what you said before!

35
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,352
It's okay. Well, let's go!

36
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,113
That's her, no mistake.

37
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,199
We've finally...found her.

38
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,788
Kidnapped!
Naruto's Hot Spring Adventure!

39
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,513
We have the pleasure of
a visit from four people and one piglet.

40
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,223
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

41
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,023
Even though this has mixed bathing...

42
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:14,028
I'm all alone with this brat.
I'm so unlucky.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,031
Well then, shall we play pachinko
or something?

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,825
We have plenty of time before dinner.

45
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,244
You're not going to the hot spring?

46
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,330
If we go right now, there are fools...

47
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,915
So, let's go, let's go.

48
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm going to get out already.

49
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,929
Not yet, not yet.
Not until the girls get here.

50
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,931
Oh, I see...

51
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,727
Well, c'mon girls.
All of you, come on...

52
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,896
Welcome!

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,941
Ah, that was refreshing.

54
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,655
W-We've been robbed!

55
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,535
The necklace I got from
Old Lady Tsunade is gone!

56
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,956
Where! Where is it?!

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,252
"If you want your necklace back,
give back the money"?

58
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,546
"Will wait at the three cedars on
the mountain behind."

59
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,256
Signed, the Akagi Family.

60
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,258
Money?

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,220
What are they talking about?

62
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,348
Girls came in, all right.

63
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,058
But...

64
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,646
they're all female monkeys!

65
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,693
I want to bathe with people.

66
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,699
Hey, here I am!

67
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,660
Come out! Akagi Family!

68
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,665
What do you want, kid?!

69
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,418
That's my line!

70
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,879
I haven't borrowed any money
from you people!

71
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,132
So give me my necklace back!

72
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,134
"My" necklace?

73
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,095
Did we mistake his stuff
for that woman's?

74
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,555
Ah, that's it!
Give it back!

75
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,515
W-Wait!

76
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,726
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

77
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,270
Go!

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,231
You thieves!

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,400
-Take this!
-Go!

80
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,818
H-Help...

81
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,781
People came, all right...

82
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,076
But...

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,078
They're all men!

84
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,164
-Bring it on!
-Cheers!

85
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,292
I want to bathe with women...

86
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,882
Huh? So the one who borrowed money
is Old Lady Tsunade?

87
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,886
Yes...nicknamed
"the Legendary Sitting Duck."

88
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,306
She played at the Akagi gambling den
until she was penniless.

89
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,725
We loaned her what she lost.

90
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,852
That's right, and there's an I.O.U.

91
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,692
Wha...?! There are so many zeros!

92
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,571
I'm Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.

93
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,659
The boss ordered us to collect
on the debt three years ago...

94
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,375
We set out on a journey
from Akagi Mountain

95
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,795
prepared not to return
until we get the money back.

96
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,633
We've heard rumors about
the lady here and there...

97
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,551
But, she sure was something.

98
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:28,931
She was elusive and quite hard to find.

99
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:35,604
Then recently, we caught
some information that she'd appeared.

100
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,191
We were waiting on
the side of the road...

101
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,570
That's when we came along
with Old Lady Tsunade.

102
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,533
But why did you raid the room
so stealthily?

103
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,159
Rumor has it that

104
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,954
that ordinary means don't work
against the "Legendary Sitting Duck."

105
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,123
We didn't think that
if we tried to collect amicably,

106
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,208
she would pay us.

107
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,127
She's certainly stingy...

108
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,797
We heard that she cherished the necklace
next to her life,

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,299
so we thought she'd pay
in exchange for it.

110
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,637
No way. After all, you raided my room.

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,767
We never even dreamed that the owner
of the necklace would have changed...

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:19,481
Err... Can't you ask the lady to pay?

113
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,818
Uh, even you say so...

114
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,196
Please! If we don't get the money back,
we can't go home!

115
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,490
Our wives and kids are waiting for us
to come home!

116
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,536
-Please...I'm begging you!
-Please...I'm begging you!

117
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,044
It's all gone...

118
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,673
Bad luck...
Darn it. I'm stone broke.

119
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,050
Well, let's call it quits with pachinko.

120
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,468
It's about time for a bath...

121
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,137
-Shizune...
-Yes?

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,639
My bag is at the front desk of the inn.

123
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,977
What?!
Y-You can't mean to bring it here?!

124
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,146
Everything to your name is in it...

125
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,984
I've just lost! I can't repress this feeling!

126
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,111
Just bring it without complaint.

127
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,197
Yes, ma'am!

128
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,536
Huh? Could you be...

129
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,539
Y-You are...!

130
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,126
There are women, all right...

131
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,589
But...

132
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,348
I was hoping for younger,
more titillating women...

133
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,851
This one, right?

134
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,978
Thank you...

135
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,147
Are you with Ms. Tsunade?

136
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,523
Yes.

137
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,567
This came for her not long ago...

138
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,779
To Tsunade
A letter? I wonder who could've...?

139
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,827
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!

140
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,746
Lady Tsunade!

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,707
Huh? Lady Tsunade!

142
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,419
She's not here...

143
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,422
Okay, Tonton...

144
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,634
You know to search for
Lady Tsunade, right!

145
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,850
What, impossible? Why?

146
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,605
I see! The smell of the sulfur
from the hot spring interferes...

147
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,817
Well then, the only way
to search for her is on foot!

148
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,277
Lady Tsunade!

149
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,155
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!

150
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,618
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!

151
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,578
Where are you!

152
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,080
We have a problem!

153
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,666
Lady Tsunade!

154
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,089
Oh, what in the world should I do?

155
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,009
We have Naruto Uzumaki.

156
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,470
If you want him returned unharmed,
please return all of the money you owe!

157
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:59,057
We'll wait by the three cedars on
the mountain behind. The Akagi Family

158
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,269
What should I do?
I have to help Naruto.

159
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,897
On top of that, if it's discovered
that Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,

160
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,943
talk of her installment as
the Fifth Hokage will probably end.

161
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,615
That's right, we have
to handle this by ourselves.

162
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,826
Right, Tonton?

163
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,667
Do you think it's going to work out well?

164
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,544
No problem.

165
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,795
Here she comes.

166
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,761
Old Lady Tsunade!

167
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,220
Stop!

168
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,182
You know who we are, right?

169
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,352
You're the henchmen of the Akagi.

170
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,479
Then I'll make it brief.

171
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,899
Pay back your debt
in one lump sum.

172
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,192
Or else...

173
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,445
his life is over!

174
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,156
Help me!

175
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,868
Whatever.
His life doesn't matter much to me.

176
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,454
-Huh!
-What did you just say?!

177
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,206
Well then, the money...

178
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,004
Why did it come to this?

179
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,466
This isn't titillating,
this is just tight!

180
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,099
Drats! Let me have patience!

181
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,188
Didn't you hear me?

182
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,817
It doesn't matter to me
what happens with his life.

183
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,653
You... darn old hag!

184
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,490
Was what I would have said,
until just a little bit ago, I think.

185
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,286
Once I become the Hokage,
he'd be a precious subordinate.

186
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,038
I can't leave him in the mess.

187
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,250
Old Lady Tsunade...

188
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,004
Right now, this is all I've got.
Take it.

189
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,303
Let me make sure of this.

190
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,270
I don't mean it's paid off in full,
but that'll do it for the interest, right?

191
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,362
Fake!

192
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,247
You're not going to pay
the money back?

193
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,957
It's none of your business.

194
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,128
These guys can't go home!
Don't you feel sorry for them!

195
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,588
You couldn't possibly?

196
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,549
In that case, I'll have to use force
to get it back!

197
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,596
Naruto's Shadow Clones?!

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,184
I see, Naruto has joined hands
with the Akagi Family...

199
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,145
So, where did Naruto and company go?

200
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,316
As expected...

201
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,735
I didn't think she'd hand
the money over meekly.

202
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,487
But to be that much of a coward...

203
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,113
What should we do?

204
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,033
Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.

205
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,243
No doubt there's money in it.

206
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,206
We have to do something
to get our hands on that suitcase.

207
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,965
Shoot!

208
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,469
I'm supposed to be kidnapped,
and she's casually drinking sake.

209
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,263
It's that suitcase.

210
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,723
How do we get it out?

211
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,559
Leave it to me.

212
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,650
Lady Tsunade, you've returned.

213
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,237
Ah, here's the suitcase.

214
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,198
It's dangerous,
so let's leave it at the front desk.

215
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,158
Well then...

216
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,093
Look, I went and got it!

217
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,886
-You did it!
-You did it!

218
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,267
Old Lady Tsunade!

219
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,646
Shoot... If you're the Hokage...

220
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,402
If you're the Hokage, then pay your debt back
like a Hokage would!

221
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,573
A Hokage is meant
to protect everyone!

222
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,659
These guys can't return their home,
they are desperate!

223
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,744
Why don't you do something?!

224
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,829
Naruto...

225
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,416
Or do people from other countries
not matter to you?

226
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,128
That kind of Hokage...
I cannot accept!

227
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,922
Now!

228
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,385
Here!

229
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,636
Hurry up and run away!

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,721
-Right!
-Okay!

231
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,359
Oh, she's already catching up!

232
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,445
It's all or nothing!

233
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,367
-Huh?
-You did it!

234
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,747
Tonton?!

235
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,206
Naruto!

236
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,085
Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!

237
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,212
F-Fork over the suitcase!

238
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,845
If we take a direct hit from
Old Lady Tsunade's attack,

239
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,347
then it's over!

240
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,892
-Out of the way, out of the way!
-Purse snatchers?

241
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,227
-Excuse us!
-Hey what's going on?!

242
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,689
Hey! Don't cause trouble
for the general public!

243
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,276
It's because you're following us!

244
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,197
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

245
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,624
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

246
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,220
What's going on...?

247
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,972
Naruto, we leave it up to you.

248
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,392
This is no good.

249
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,060
If the contents of that suitcase
become known,

250
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,937
it will be a disaster...

251
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,484
That's right, that happened too.

252
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,362
And I was young then too.

253
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,364
Gulp it down.

254
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,951
Excuse me, Boss.

255
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,829
What is it? You're in front of a guest.

256
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,288
W-Well...

257
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,384
A clone!

258
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,349
That's a clone too?

259
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,022
Wrong again.

260
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,653
Sheesh, which is the real one?!

261
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,659
The rest...

262
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,828
-Where are the rest?!
-Where are the rest?!

263
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,595
Over there!

264
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,726
-Hold it!
-Hold it!

265
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,731
-Naruto!
-Naruto!

266
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,734
-Wait!
-Wait!

267
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,529
-Naruto!
-Naruto!

268
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,951
Prepare yourself!

269
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,379
Shoot, let me go! Let me go!

270
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,798
Settle down!

271
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,511
G-Got it!

272
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,012
The money!

273
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,472
Okay, they got it!

274
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,146
IOU's?!

275
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,397
It's not money?!

276
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,318
-Oh no...
-This is too much!

277
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,154
What are you doing?!
This is in the middle of town!

278
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,698
Huh!

279
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,078
T-Two Old Ladies?!

280
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,039
You're mixed up in
this commotion as well?

281
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,333
I'd like to hear your reason
for it, Shizune!

282
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,922
Hello... Lady Tsunade...

283
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,799
What?! Shizune...

284
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,760
And you guys belong to the Akagi.

285
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,304
B-Boss Jirocho!

286
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,389
Who?

287
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,723
You don't know?!

288
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,519
He's the number one gang boss,
Jirocho from the Land of Tea!

289
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,272
He's an old friend of mine.

290
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,983
As luck would have it,
we met by accident on the street.

291
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,735
You're Bunzo and Senta
if I'm not mistaken.

292
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,197
Just in time.
I have something to say to you!

293
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,742
-What?!
-What?!

294
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,121
You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?

295
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,206
I paid it back a year ago.

296
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,709
Is that true?

297
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,795
That was last year,
when we were near Akagi's.

298
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,589
Did you forget?

299
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,465
I-I'm sorry.

300
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,092
Hey!

301
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,303
It's a circular from Akagi
addressed to me.

302
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,931
I'll just read the part addressed to you.

303
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,392
"Senta and Bunzo,

304
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,187
"The debt is paid, come home soon."
Signed, Shugoro Akagi.

305
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,273
See?

306
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,651
You've gotta be kidding.

307
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,406
All that energy spent, for nothing.

308
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,368
-Thank you for helping us.
-Thank you for helping us.

309
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,080
-Now we can go home relieved.
-Now we can go home relieved.

310
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,541
Go in good spirits.

311
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,836
-You too, Naruto. Take care!
-You too, Naruto. Take care!

312
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,131
Hey, if the suitcase
doesn't have money in it,

313
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,717
why were you so serious
about getting it back?

314
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,927
That's...

315
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,473
If the IOU's were discovered
by the people in the village,

316
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,602
they'll oppose Lady Tsunade's
installment as Hokage.

317
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,355
You worry too much.

318
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,565
The Hokage and the debt
are unrelated.

319
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,652
Not only that,
she said she returned the money,

320
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,196
so there's nothing to worry about.

321
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,032
-At least the Akagi debt was...
-What?

322
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,117
Don't worry, don't worry!

323
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,080
What? We forgot something?

324
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,467
Finally, the time has come.

325
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,803
Communal bathing with girls...

326
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,973
Patience paid off...

327
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,228
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

328
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:14,983
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

329
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:19,946
On your still shoulder

330
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,575
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

331
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

332
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

333
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,882
"Each one of us

334
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,554
glows differently,"

335
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,432
you say laughingly

336
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:53,730
but you look most dazzling

337
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,151
Like a comet,

338
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:04,323
like the rainbow after the storm

339
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,953
You bring light

340
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,456
into my heart

341
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

342
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:21,966
can be the answer

343
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,304
Let's promise

344
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:30,892
we won't cheat

345
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,979
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

346
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,025
You're awesome,
Old Lady Tsunade!

347
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,277
Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke
are all right now!

348
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,613
You can't rejoice yet.

349
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,574
The current situation
in the village is serious.

350
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,700
You're right.
I have to do my best,

351
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,368
And work hard for
the village as well.

352
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,121
Hey! N-Naruto,
where do you think you're going?!

353
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,248
I have to fill my stomach first!

354
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,293
You have no sense of emergency...

355
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,546
Next time: "Tsunade's Warning:
Ninja No More!"

356
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,257
What is that supposed to mean?!
