1
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,276
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,497
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:44,545
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,303
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,099
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:04,106
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,946
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,912
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,714
and melting away

14
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,624
Sand Coffin!

15
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,420
I'll do it.

16
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,343
No! Please back me up.

17
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,934
I got sand in my mouth...

18
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,477
P-Please let me go!

19
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,902
You wouldn't be able to do
anything in your current state...

20
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,363
I'll do it.

21
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,156
Please be careful!

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,200
That guy attacks with bones!

23
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,332
Like earlier...

24
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,128
he does things like shoot bones
and extrude bones from inside his body...

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,589
He controls bones freely!

26
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,799
Gaara of the Desert...

27
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,222
You use sand, as the name implies, huh...?

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,773
Gaara vs. Kimimaro

29
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,034
Tough defense using sand...

30
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:25,039
He...isn't a close-range combat type...

31
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,918
Getting close would be difficult, huh.

32
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,969
It's coming!

33
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,764
Digital Shrapnel!

34
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,657
There's no waste in his movements...

35
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,326
Sure enough,
he's a considerable Taijutsu user.

36
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,121
Attack and defense are one...

37
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,707
He attacks and defends with sand, huh?

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,128
However, the amount of sand
he can control is probably...

39
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,090
...about the amount of sand
inside the gourd.

40
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,552
Gaara of the Desert... A dopey nickname.

41
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,517
You can't do anything
if you don't have sand.

42
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,938
Going to the trouble of walking around
carrying heavy sand

43
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,606
is the very proof of that.

44
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,821
Sand Shower...

45
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,035
How trite...

46
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,666
As long as I have sand, I can do anything.

47
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,668
You're the one who's dopey...

48
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,673
It's easy for me to do things
like create sand with dirt...

49
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,009
I get it...

50
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,471
With his own sand he grinds things
like rocks and minerals in dirt

51
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,015
and makes it into sand.

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,476
So he was sending his own sand
beneath the ground

53
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,438
and adding new sand, huh...?

54
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,815
Gaara of the Desert...

55
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,985
His nickname isn't just for display.

56
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,486
Excellent!

57
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,701
You did it!
Not yet.

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
Sand Burial!

59
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,139
I'm reminded of that man
when I look at that guy.

60
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,142
Huh?
Sasuke Uchiha!

61
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,479
He had the same eyes as that guy...

62
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,689
The same eyes?

63
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,568
Wanting to verify the value
of one's own existence...

64
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,570
Such eyes...

65
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,495
Sasuke!

66
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,910
Sasuke!

67
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,042
Sasuke.

68
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,546
You're here, aren't you?!
At least answer me!

69
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,099
What's gotten into you?!

70
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,478
I don't hate the darkness...

71
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,700
The darkness is where I was brought up...

72
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:48,320
Why am I...in a place like this?

73
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,491
Did I do something wrong?

74
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,042
Is there really God...?

75
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,630
If there is, why confine me
in a place like this?

76
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,553
Who's there?

77
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,974
It doesn't matter who I am... Get out!

78
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,400
Kimimaro, the time has come to use you...

79
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,360
Huh?

80
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,363
For our sake, for the Kaguya Clan...

81
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,074
Fight!

82
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,789
Yes... To fight.

83
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,833
That is...

84
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,212
the only thing I can do now.

85
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,280
N-No way...

86
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,125
That's quite some pressure...

87
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,173
I would've been flattened just like that

88
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,675
had I not made a membrane
of bone just below the skin.

89
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,359
Bones...That guy's a monster, too.

90
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,152
It's a troublesome body, isn't it?

91
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,864
I underestimated you...

92
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,034
But, I won't be caught by
your sand anymore.

93
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,755
Sand Tsunami!

94
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,286
Wow... It's beyond the scope of

95
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,497
escaping from the sand
or not getting caught...

96
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,805
To think it would change
the terrain itself...

97
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,442
You...You did it.

98
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,818
Not yet.

99
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,781
Giant Sand Burial!

100
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,876
H-He's so strong...

101
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,379
He's gotten even stronger
than when he fought me.

102
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,842
But...this time for sure...

103
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,804
He's a persistent guy...
Huh?!

104
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,769
I'm still...alive...

105
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,399
Then... There's still significance
for me to live.

106
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,530
From now, we're going
to launch a night attack

107
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,615
on the Hidden Mist Village...

108
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,452
As they are disconcerted
from that incident,

109
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,788
now is the perfect time for us
to make them realize our ferocity!

110
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:18,757
Make them realize the ferocity
of the Kaguya Clan!

111
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,759
– Yeah!
– Right!

112
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,180
What're you doing, Kimimaro? Get going!

113
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,891
I don't know what to do...

114
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,894
You don't need to think deeply about it.

115
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,771
Go down to the Hidden Mist Village

116
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,106
and kill every last person you encounter!

117
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,280
Just act on your instincts!

118
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,206
Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?

119
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,005
No...

120
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,260
I-I see... Excuse me!

121
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,813
Haku?
Oh...no. It's nothing, Zabuza.

122
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,691
We don't have time to be stopping.
Let's hurry!

123
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,318
Right!

124
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,491
He had the same eyes as I...

125
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,327
Before I met Zabuza...

126
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,136
Hold it!

127
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,560
You're a hasty one, aren't you?
I'm not from this village.

128
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,070
The thing you are after is right there...

129
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,573
Now, go.

130
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,538
It seems to have begun...

131
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,292
The Kaguya Clan...

132
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:23,506
Fools who can only find
their own path of life by fighting...

133
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,966
It was long ago

134
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,720
when a simple-minded group that
just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.

135
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,765
With a governed organization
as an opponent,

136
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,933
they just become fools
rushing towards death

137
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,062
if they fight only with power...

138
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,276
Are we the only survivors...?

139
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,071
It seems we're surrounded...

140
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,199
The defense was tighter than we thought.

141
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,159
We have no choice...

142
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,287
Now it's come to this,
take along with you every person you can!

143
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,250
We'll have them entertain us
as much as possible!

144
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,629
What do I fight for...?

145
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,006
What am I...?

146
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,927
Without knowing anything,
I just kept on fighting.

147
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,389
The time has come to use you...

148
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,308
I'm needed...

149
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,770
That was the only thing
that got my body moving.

150
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,438
And...

151
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,192
I was also able to figure out that...

152
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,528
I couldn't live if I didn't fight.

153
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,960
Dawn broke...

154
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,422
And I learned that...

155
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,883
I myself was the only one to survive.

156
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,929
Again, I'm all alone...

157
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,852
By myself, I just wandered
aimlessly from place to place.

158
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,108
This is...

159
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,888
The flower, from back then...?

160
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,685
Why are you blooming in a place like this?

161
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,315
Why won't you answer?

162
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,653
You're ignoring me, too, huh?!

163
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,200
There's no way you'd be seen
by someone in a place like this, yet you...!

164
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,202
That's enough...

165
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:04,125
Maybe...there's no significance to living.

166
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,963
But you might be able to
discover something interesting

167
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,591
by continuing to live...right?

168
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,596
Like how you discovered that flower...

169
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,851
Like how I discovered you.

170
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,441
Okay, Let's go...

171
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,619
Back then... Lord Orochimaru said that, but...

172
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,791
People are born with
some kind of significance.

173
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:50,880
That's what I think...
some kind of important mission.

174
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,260
The mission for me...

175
00:18:55,343 --> 00:19:00,348
is to protect Lord Orochimaru
and his ambition.

176
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,773
What's...that?!

177
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:23,913
Come back, Sasuke!
Everyone's worried about you!

178
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,713
Damn it...
It's so dark I can't see anything!

179
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,216
You've got better eyes than me.

180
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,305
Sasuke is in the darkness now...

181
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,348
N-Neji?!

182
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,392
You'll be unable to catch up with Sasuke

183
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,561
if you stop in a place like this...

184
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,687
Neji!

185
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:55,570
Yeah... You're right!
This isn't the time to stop.

186
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:01,326
Just wait! I'll take Sasuke
back home no matter what!

187
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,459
Sasuke!

188
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,859
Sand Coffin!

189
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,548
That form...?!

190
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,356
For the first time, I spoke to you

191
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,693
And you smiled

192
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,945
For the first time, I was able to speak

193
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,447
In my own words

194
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:27,578
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

195
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:32,792
Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage

196
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,881
My clumsy attempts with words

197
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:44,387
You listened without turning away

198
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,893
No wonder I get carried away by you

199
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:57,275
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

200
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,778
I feel so sad

201
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:01,904
But...

202
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,157
For the first time, I spoke to you

203
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,909
And you smiled

204
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,871
For the first time, I was able to speak

205
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,582
In my own words

206
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,460
For the first time, I spoke to you

207
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,337
And you smiled

208
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,090
For the first time, I was able to speak

209
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,926
In my own words

210
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,389
For the first time, I spoke to you

211
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,984
I'm saved. That's excellent.

212
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,652
To think you could do such a thing!

213
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,364
He was persistent,
but this is the end...

214
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,784
He'll never come out again.

215
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,786
Brainwashed by Orochimaru...

216
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,582
It's not brainwashing!
That person understands me!

217
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,044
What do you guys know?!

218
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,547
