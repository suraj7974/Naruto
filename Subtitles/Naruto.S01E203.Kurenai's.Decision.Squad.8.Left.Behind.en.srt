1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:06,590
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,556
into your hands

3
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:32,366
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,789
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,468
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,974
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:04,315
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I'm not by your side

9
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,613
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

10
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:16,869
into your hands

11
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:23,167
I can feel it so close,

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

13
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:51,403
Sure enough, I just can't get
into training by myself.

14
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,041
As for the Pervy Sage...

15
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,836
I wonder what he's doing and where?

16
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:12,508
And what happened to him
watching my training?! Damn it!

17
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,480
What's she doing?

18
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,875
Wow, are you painting a picture?

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,507
Huh?!

20
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,182
There's nothing like rain clouds
in the sky.

21
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,109
Wha...?

22
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,383
The Hokage's house!

23
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,189
Hurry! Get a move on.

24
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,066
Water, water, water!

25
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,150
Right away!

26
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,610
– Water Style!
– Water Style!

27
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,654
– Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
– Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!

28
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,578
Whoa! You idiots.
Not me, up on the roof!

29
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,538
We're very sorry!

30
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,794
Right, keep it up.

31
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:12,878
Yes, ma'am!

32
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,183
As I thought, the thing I had feared
has happened...

33
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,940
Kurenai's Decision:
Squad 8 Left Behind

34
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,780
There she is.

35
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,617
Hey! Wait up!

36
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,799
Giving us trouble.

37
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,844
Let's hurry up and take her back.
Right.

38
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,470
Hey, wait!

39
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,223
What're you guys doing?!

40
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,686
Anbu Black Ops?!

41
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,440
Naruto Uzumaki,
leave this place immediately.

42
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,774
Huh?!

43
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,278
As for her, what'd she do?

44
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,155
It doesn't concern you.

45
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,159
Listen up. Don't breathe a word
of what you saw here.

46
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,120
Knock it off! Just a minute!

47
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,622
Don't get in our way!

48
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,794
Oh! They vanished...

49
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,757
Damn it! What's going on?!

50
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,637
Oh, important documents are soaked.

51
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,598
This will have to be dried in the sun.

52
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,349
I'll take them outside.

53
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,434
Thanks.

54
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,230
'Morning.

55
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,982
Oh, Kurenai Sensei.

56
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,358
Is the Fifth Hokage in?

57
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,443
Yes.

58
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,701
So? Is there no change to your sentiment
about pulling out of Squad 8?

59
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,952
No.

60
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,964
Think about it carefully.

61
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,842
Kiba, Shino, Hinata...

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,136
You're the one who recommended
those guys lacking in experience

63
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,013
for the Chunin Exam.

64
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,432
You don't care about them?

65
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:34,186
But I must not leave that
problem unresolved.

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,979
It's my responsibility, so...

67
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,858
That incident was no fault of yours.

68
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,996
If the Anbu Black Ops are involved,
then is she a considerably bad person?

69
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,792
Or was she involved in some kind
of significant incident?

70
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,837
What did you say?!

71
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,964
Calm down, Kiba.

72
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,549
Kiba, Hinata?

73
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,595
Hey, Shino. Say that again!

74
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,348
Very well. I said it'd be futile.

75
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,559
How dare you say something like that...!

76
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,437
Cut it out!

77
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,522
Naruto.

78
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,317
Calm down. What the hell's wrong?

79
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:27,156
We in Squad 8 were left high
and dry by Kurenai Sensei.

80
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,658
Huh? What do you mean?

81
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,162
You see, Sensei spoke to us
directly about it.

82
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,667
My duty is completed.

83
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,880
You will probably be provided with
another chief Jonin eventually.

84
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,966
Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.

85
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,050
Sensei...

86
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,178
It's written in stone.

87
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,265
Our relationship is just that of
commander and subordinate.

88
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,519
It's just the team formation changing
as circumstances demand.

89
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,815
And that was that.
She didn't even give us a reason.

90
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,444
That was that?
Are you guys going to accept that?

91
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,531
Hell no! That's why I'm saying we should
march into the Hokage's office and

92
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:14,786
protest why she is removing
Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!

93
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,747
Then this Shino says...

94
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,749
I'm saying it's futile.

95
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,503
It's because this might be something
she herself decided on.

96
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,797
Pig-headed jerk...!

97
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,467
Hinata, what do you think?

98
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,430
I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay
as our chief Jonin...

99
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,934
But...
But what?!

100
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,188
Kurenai Sensei might have some kind
of reason of her own...

101
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,606
Umm...

102
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,817
So you're the same as Shino, huh?

103
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,778
No... Kiba!

104
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,783
Just stop fighting already.
I'll do something about this.

105
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,577
Naruto, you're not even on this team.

106
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,870
What're you going to do?

107
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,664
Leave it to me.

108
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,417
I won't let Kurenai Sensei quit,
no matter what.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,764
I blurted out that they can leave it to me,
but I don't know.
Hm?

110
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,601
Kurenai Sensei.

111
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,895
What's she doing?

112
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,400
All right, I should ask her directly.

113
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,281
Umm, Sensei.

114
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:34,950
Naruto.

115
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,619
I heard from Kiba and the others.

116
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:38,870
What?

117
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,040
Don't give up being in charge of Squad 8.

118
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,959
They're really depressed.

119
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,211
That's why you went to
the trouble of coming?

120
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,673
Yeah. It seems they really revere you.

121
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,635
I don't know what you heard
from those kids,

122
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,053
but I can't do that.

123
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,306
I don't deserve to.

124
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,808
Deserve?

125
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,271
Please tell them all for me.
Tell them I'm never coming back.

126
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,356
Sensei.

127
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,696
Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.

128
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,992
Since it's come to this,
I guess I'll try Grandma Tsunade directly.

129
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,964
Naruto.
Sakura!

130
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,549
What is it?

131
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,928
Kurenai Sensei says she's going
to quit Squad 8,

132
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,556
so I'm going to try asking
Grandma Tsunade directly.

133
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,267
I think that'd be useless...Probably.

134
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,977
It'll be okay.

135
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:47,105
As for me, I know the place where
she keeps her alcohol hidden,

136
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,900
so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune...

137
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,612
I mean, she must have some
good reason for quitting.

138
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,740
What? What? By any chance,
do you know something, Sakura?

139
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,866
Huh?

140
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,370
You know something, right? Tell me.

141
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,747
No, don't know anything.

142
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,791
Come on, tell me!

143
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,125
You're a pest.

144
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,504
Would I ever do something like eavesdrop
on someone's important talk?

145
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,298
What? You eavesdropped?

146
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,841
Yikes!

147
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,054
You idiot. Don't talk so loud!

148
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,769
Yakumo?

149
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,397
Yeah. If I remember correctly,
that's what she said.

150
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,694
I am at fault for letting Yakumo
become like that.

151
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,072
No, I'd say instead that she was
fine up until now

152
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,866
because I put her in your custody...

153
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,244
Shizune, how're the
nursing arrangements?

154
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,371
A three-man team consisting of

155
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,457
two Medical Ninja and
one Anbu Black Ops member

156
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,711
are keeping a 24-hour watch over her
in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.

157
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,465
Even so, you can't rest easy?
No.

158
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,261
I want to take responsibility
in my own way.

159
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,055
Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning...

160
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,394
The conditions are spot-on.

161
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,314
What was the girl's name again?

162
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,524
Yakumo.

163
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,318
Ya-ku-mo. Thanks, Sakura.

164
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,738
Hey, Naruto.
Don't tell anyone I said anything!

165
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,074
Yeah, I know.

166
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,166
If that girl is Yakumo,

167
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,461
then she might know something
about Kurenai Sensei.

168
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,616
Lee, you're not quite there yet.

169
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,950
Right.

170
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,376
Kurenai Yuhi.

171
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,214
I make this request with full confidence

172
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,299
that you are the best practitioner
of Genjutsu in this village.

173
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,478
Could you take charge of that girl?

174
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,022
Who's this girl?

175
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,983
Yakumo Kurama.

176
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,320
You know about
the Kurama Clan, don't you?

177
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,863
Yes.

178
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,950
At one time, they were a clan excelling
in Genjutsu

179
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,785
and were a power in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

180
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,329
in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.

181
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,541
But they haven't been blessed
in recent years with talent,

182
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,002
their force has weakened and

183
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:02,008
they have not been able to
turn out Jonin-class Shinobi.

184
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,469
Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama...

185
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,765
Yes... She's the only daughter
of the Muragumo of the head family.

186
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,562
She has health issues and is
not enrolled in the Academy.

187
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,605
Then you want me to take charge of her

188
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,399
and train her to be
a practitioner of Genjutsu?

189
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,483
No.

190
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,572
There's no doubt Yakumo's latent
Genjutsu powers are excellent.

191
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,657
So much so that those in the clan

192
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,286
put their dreams of rebuilding
the family on her.

193
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,414
Was there some kind of problem?

194
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,376
This is just between us.

195
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,837
Yes.

196
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:45,260
Yakumo's parents, Muragumo Kurama
and his wife died, but...

197
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,477
You okay? Don't push yourself too hard.

198
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,271
I'm okay. I'm fine.

199
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,692
I'm just a bit out of breath.

200
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,195
Listen to me, Yakumo.

201
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,532
A Shinobi is not your only path.

202
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,617
Huh?

203
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,121
You're a girl and you should
have many other ways to live.

204
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,624
I want to become a Ninja!

205
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:20,962
I heard there's a student named Rock Lee
who can't use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu

206
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,257
striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.

207
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,886
I may not have much physical strength,

208
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,599
but I could become a Ninja if I were to
use that power, right?

209
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,310
A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.

210
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,563
I'm not a teacher like Guy.

211
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,317
Unfortunately, I cannot train you.

212
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,950
All right, that's all for today.

213
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,369
Thank you very much.

214
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,455
Take a bath and get a good rest.

215
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,416
Right. Good-bye.

216
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,633
Lee has improved again, huh?

217
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,845
I heard.
It seems you're quitting Squad 8.

218
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,806
I have no choice.

219
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,975
Those who develop under me
end up not developing.

220
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,936
It's not like that.

221
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,772
Although they're no match for my team,

222
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,359
the growth of the Genin in
your team is striking.

223
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,279
If that's the case,
it's not because of my help.

224
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,824
It's the results of their own efforts.

225
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,785
Hey, Kurenai.

226
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,080
What do you think it is that we can do?

227
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:45,505
As you say, Lee growing to that extent
is due to his own efforts.

228
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,969
All I did for him was to believe in him.

229
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,973
We believe in our pupils even
at the cost of our lives.

230
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,892
We just need to believe in them
with all our power,

231
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,520
and hug them with all our power.

232
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,897
It's not a difficult thing in the least.

233
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,777
Guy, I envy you...

234
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,364
I couldn't even do something that simple.

235
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,286
Hey, Kurenai.

236
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,789
Believe in yourself!

237
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,467
From where and how are Kurenai Sensei

238
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,636
and that girl from
this morning connected?

239
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,140
It would seem to be worth looking into.

240
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,529
That's the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.

241
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,492
Satomi Hill Cottage

242
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,794
The east trap?

243
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,878
So it seems.

244
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,922
An intruder?

245
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,006
Yes.

246
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,220
Kurenai.

247
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:20,475
Good work on your 24-hour guard.
I came to visit Yakumo.

248
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,352
This late at night?

249
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,730
Yakumo is resting inside.

250
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,568
Could you guys step away for a bit?
I want to talk to her alone.

251
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,653
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,072
Don't be long.

253
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,157
I'll be done in ten minutes.

254
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,492
Fine.

255
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,044
Nothing but creepy paintings.

256
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,977
Please, Sensei!

257
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,456
– What?!
– What?!

258
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,673
Whoa, my heart, my heart!

259
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,094
Huh? There's nothing wrong.

260
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,430
Hey, it's you again?!

261
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,558
To think you'd transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.

262
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,478
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?

263
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,066
Shut up! For your sake,
don't be nosing around needlessly.

264
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,738
Hey.

265
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,991
You're Yakumo. Right?

266
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,329
I want to ask you something
about Kurenai Sensei!

267
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,293
Damn it.

268
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:10,103
The Key to the rusted heart's door

269
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:16,109
Will always be smiling right near by

270
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,244
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

271
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

272
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,670
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

273
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:40,550
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

274
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,471
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

275
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:49,809
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

276
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:54,188
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

277
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:57,567
I'll change it right away,

278
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,654
lighting it with all my feeling

279
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,825
The wind is probably testing our hearts

280
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,705
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

281
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,209
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

282
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:19,964
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

283
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

284
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,683
Will always be smiling right near by

285
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,233
Why am I sleeping in a place like this?

286
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,194
It's because you trespassed
into the cottage

287
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,320
under special security, remember?!

288
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,780
Oh, right.
Geez, really...

289
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,241
Just be grateful you still have your life,
the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.

290
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,744
The Anbu Black Ops?
That's right, I have no time for this!

291
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,245
Hey Naruto, where are you going?

292
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:56,292
Sorry Sakura, I have to ask
Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!

293
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,252
Oh, hey wait! Naruto!

294
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,672
Next time: "Yakumo's Sealed Power"
