1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,224
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,403
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,491
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,746
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:43,836
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,687
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,149
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,652
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,448
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,118
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,250
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,713
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,109
Sasuke...

21
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,997
My, my arm!

22
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,083
Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,793
Please take this medicine quickly.

24
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,647
Oh, my...

25
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,483
Just as I get back,
I have to clean the room.

26
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,736
Please make sure you to take
your medicine.

27
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,699
I don't need that kind
of lip service.

28
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,785
It's medicine that I prescribed.

29
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,955
The pain should subside
at least slightly.

30
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,666
The pain on this arm
that seems to burn...

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,211
I never thought that it cause
this much suffering.

32
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:55,467
Sarutobi...known as Third Hokage.
It's his last curse, after all.

33
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,303
Enough of the talking...

34
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,471
More importantly,
has that individual been found?

35
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,018
Yes... She seems to be at a place
called Tanzaku Town.

36
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,354
Tanzaku Town...

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,026
Is that so...?

38
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,822
But the opponent is one of the Sannin,
the Legendary Three Ninjas.

39
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,450
It won't be that simple.

40
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,998
Good medicine tends to taste bitter.

41
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,636
Here.

42
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:44,099
It's the same one...
But this is the trick?

43
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,227
You're the type who was yelled at
at the academy

44
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,979
for not having concentration, right?

45
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,565
That doesn't have anything
to do with me now.

46
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,026
Look at this paper.

47
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,028
Uh?

48
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,906
I've seen it.
Fine, then.

49
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,283
Look at it again.

50
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,038
Hmm?

51
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,212
So what is this?

52
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,883
It's not something that
I need to explain in length,

53
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,010
but when you first looked
at this blank piece of paper,

54
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,013
you just glanced at
the whole thing, correct?

55
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,264
Probably.

56
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,059
Then where do you look on this one?

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,480
Most likely the point in the middle?

58
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,443
When a human being looks at
just a blank piece of paper,

59
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,364
he doesn't know where to look,
so the eyes wander.

60
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,829
But if you put even a single point on it,

61
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,872
the mind focuses there...

62
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,627
This is concentrating at a single point
and as you focus your mind,

63
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:58,799
you become spiritually stable and
you are able to extract unexpected power.

64
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,759
Huh?

65
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,388
When you opened a hole
on the rubber ball,

66
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,472
you must have been
concentrating desperately

67
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,601
to fill up the Chakra
in the palm of your hand.

68
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,978
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,605
When you concentrate,
power emerges.

70
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:18,444
But without a target,
it is difficult to concentrate.

71
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,112
That's why we have this...

72
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,781
Listen Naruto, from now on,

73
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,200
when you store up the Chakra
you build in your right hand,

74
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,621
try to store it up by concentrating
on that mark.

75
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,707
Concentrate...

76
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,627
All right, I'll try it!

77
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,674
Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf

78
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,556
Concentrate!

79
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,324
Darn it. It's not supposed to be like this.

80
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,533
It has to break like "pang."

81
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,666
Concentrate!

82
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,354
Hello... I'd like to make a little inquiry.

83
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,293
Dang it.

84
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,511
Concentrate.

85
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,371
Concentrate!

86
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,713
No good.

87
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:59,021
Dang it. What does it mean
to concentrate?!

88
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,415
Damn you, Sarutobi!

89
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
All right then...

90
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,317
I'm going again to gather
some information.

91
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,111
What...? But you just came.

92
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,530
I don't have any time to waste.

93
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,784
Hey, hey...!

94
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,370
Isn't there going to be even
a little soulful game of catch

95
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,247
between the master and pupil?

96
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,917
You scoundrel.

97
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,090
Strike!

98
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,093
Here, the game of catch is over.

99
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,430
See you later.

100
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:24,439
Humph... I'll forget about that Pervy Sage
and work hard by myself.

101
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,946
That's the only way, Naruto...

102
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,072
You have to do this training alone.

103
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,409
You have the ability to approach
the Fourth Hokage's level...

104
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,244
Grasp it by yourself!

105
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,252
Hmm... Never seen her.

106
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,378
If that's the case...

107
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,422
Sorry to bother you.

108
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,133
I know the person.

109
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,096
As well as where she is right now.

110
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,432
I'll buy you a drink.

111
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,854
There's no need.
I was able to win a tidy sum...

112
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,230
Thanks to that lady.

113
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,317
Yeah...you are indeed
the Legendary Sitting Duck.

114
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,321
She lost again, huh.

115
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,198
Her losses started to pile up...

116
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,492
So she was talking about
changing her location.

117
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,577
Where to?

118
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:26,543
One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,
is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.

119
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,338
Then this arm can finally...

120
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,465
Even if it's good medicine,

121
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,843
you won't get away with just
a bitter taste with that person.

122
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,927
It's fine.

123
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,146
Seven, seven, seven...

124
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,902
Seven, seven, seven...

125
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,864
Seven, seven, seven...

126
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,200
Here it comes!

127
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,870
Congratulations to the customer!

128
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,456
Fever has started
on machine number 44.

129
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,626
Now, please keep on getting it out
like a flood.

130
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,588
Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen
once in while.

131
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,716
A 3-7 for me?

132
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,515
Oh wow, lady.

133
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,101
Yeah, what a great work.

134
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,061
Wish I could be favored
by good fortune too.

135
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,022
– Oh, here it comes again!
– Here it comes again!

136
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,275
Yay...it's "fever" again!

137
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,907
A person like me pulls
a big hit like this...

138
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,661
I have a bad premonition.

139
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,582
I also have some knowledge
regarding Lady Tsunade...

140
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,169
I did use to be part of
the Medical Corps, after all.

141
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,632
She was the first person to propose
what is now an accepted practice

142
00:11:55,966 --> 00:12:00,971
of assigning one medical specialist
to a small squad of four.

143
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,558
This was a very revolutionary- idea...

144
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,019
A small combat unit that doesn't
even have emergency medical skills,

145
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,858
what would happen to them in a battlefield
is clearer than seeing fire.

146
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,988
Countless experiences in war

147
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,658
simply became knowledge
to equip themselves with.

148
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,371
Many who were sacrificed
led to the creation of that style.

149
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,749
A person understands the nature
of things for the first time

150
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,335
after losing them.

151
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:38,383
And the thing created by
one of the legendary Sannin,

152
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,511
who is known as the medical specialist

153
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,140
is that sacrifice.

154
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,730
Not working...

155
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,817
I got to concentrate even more.

156
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,614
Concentrate, concentrate.

157
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,200
Concentrate, concentrate.

158
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,951
Concentrate!

159
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,004
Concentrate...

160
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,926
Concentrate on one point.

161
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:35,273
Strike!

162
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,486
Strike!

163
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,991
That stupid perve's face floats up
in my head

164
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,868
and I can't even concentrate.

165
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,289
Oh boy...

166
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:55,377
Some gal somewhere is talking
about me again.

167
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,587
Pinball Games

168
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,423
Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!

169
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,883
What's the matter?

170
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,720
Your winning this much is like a miracle...

171
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,139
But you don't look pleased at all.

172
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,392
This town.

173
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,395
Huh?
I get a bad premonition.

174
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,480
We're going to hurry up and leave.

175
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,441
But this is a tourist resort...

176
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,944
We should take our time and
go see the famous castle and all.

177
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,613
Then we're going to hurry up
and see it so we can leave.

178
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,574
But...Lady Tsunade!

179
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,119
Lord Orochimaru!

180
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,497
Let's get this business over with.

181
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,251
Even if we have to use
a slightly rough method.

182
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,676
I got to do it.

183
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,846
Ouch!

184
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,183
Ouch... It hurts so much,
I can't even build up my Chakra...

185
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,146
He might be reaching his limit soon.

186
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:10,035
Just a bit...just a bit more rest.

187
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,824
Hey!

188
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,785
You guys, we're in class right now.

189
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,081
You...fools!

190
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:05,298
You guys have no concentration at all...!

191
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,802
This is not the way to
become fine Ninja.

192
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:13,765
How can we stay still at a table,
right, Akamaru?

193
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,602
I'm hungry.

194
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,063
Sensei, if it's a scolding,
do it quickly.

195
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,859
What the...?! You, you guys...

196
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,945
From now, we will have
an after-school lesson

197
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,406
to teach you guys more concentration!

198
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,157
– What?!
– What?!

199
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,163
What's this?

200
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,958
You guys are going to do from now

201
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,127
what the predecessors of
the Leaf Village

202
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,546
used to perform every day
as a concentration method!

203
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,382
It is training to build up Chakra

204
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,302
by concentrating your entire energy
on the leaf on your forehead.

205
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,305
It's an ancient way of learning

206
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,349
how not to become distracted
from anything else

207
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,143
by concentrating on a single point,
the leaf.

208
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,314
The one who hones his concentration
is truly a great Ninja...

209
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,277
This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol
on the headband.

210
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,945
That sounds like a lie.

211
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,490
Aren't you making that story up
to force us to try harder?

212
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,076
I'm not making this up!
It's a true story.

213
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,537
Anyhow, can you really become
a great Ninja

214
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,164
by just polishing your concentration?

215
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,959
At any rate,
a great Ninja is a guy who's strong.

216
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,252
Hey, you have a point.

217
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,962
This stuff...

218
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,674
Bye, bye Sensei!

219
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,343
Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.

220
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,971
– We won't wait!
– We don't have time for that!

221
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:40,727
Hey! You misfits!

222
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,148
This is the same thing.

223
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,821
I should have paid more attention
to what Iruka Sensei was saying...

224
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,115
I'm so stupid.

225
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,623
But nothing will start
if I just keep on regretting.

226
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,590
All right, I'm going to master this!

227
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,390
Concentrate, concentrate...

228
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,185
Concentrate!

229
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:29,192
Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have
a commanding presence!

230
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,655
It's worth being designated
as the cultural heritage.

231
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,366
Don't dally...

232
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,618
We're going to hurry up
and leave this town.

233
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,371
Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully...

234
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,832
It costs nothing to view.

235
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,962
Lady Tsunade?

236
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,843
What is this chill?

237
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,629
Now!

238
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,209
What a kid...

239
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,630
Raising the density in Chakra
to the point that it burns the palm.

240
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,800
He never ceases to amaze me.

241
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,557
It broke.

242
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,269
Good! The second step seems
to be complete.

243
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,898
Hurry... The third step.

244
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,775
That will come later.

245
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,818
We'll now go meet Tsunade.

246
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,415
That's...

247
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,921
Orochimaru.

248
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,722
I found you.

249
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,481
A cycle of hardship, right?

250
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,403
Inside, we were crying, right?

251
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,698
But the one thing we won't give up

252
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

253
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,707
It's a secondary role,

254
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,671
a role in the shadows

255
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

256
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

257
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,020
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

258
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:57,316
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

259
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,402
Over and over,

260
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,822
we believed

261
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,076
and dreamed

262
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:18,296
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

263
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,050
Now, it's our turn...

264
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:29,140
Let us bask in our dreams

265
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,736
I can master the third step while walking?
Give me a break!

266
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,156
Fool! If we don't hurry it up,
we'll lose Tsunade!

267
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,825
Besides, she's short-tempered
and impatient!

268
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:48,910
Where are we heading?

269
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,246
If she's here in this town, we'll just
look for her from somewhere high up.

270
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,956
– So we'll climb up a castle.
– Castle?!

271
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,292
– Can't you see over there?!
– Which way is "over there"?

272
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,543
I'm saying...

273
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,671
Oh! What the...?!

274
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,840
Next time: "An Impossible Choice:
The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart"
