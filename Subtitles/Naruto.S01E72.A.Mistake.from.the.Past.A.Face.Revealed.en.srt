1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:06,841
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,641
let's start walking

4
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,059
<=title>

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

12
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

16
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,903
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

17
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

19
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

20
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,795
let's start walking

21
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

22
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,933
Sasuke's movements have stopped!
There's still quite a bit of distance, though...

23
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,521
So Sasuke caught up to him, huh?

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,773
Okay!

25
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,025
Huh? This smell is...?!

26
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,488
W-What's wrong?!

27
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,740
Did something happen to Sasuke?!

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,993
I didn't notice until now.

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,162
You...

30
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,707
use the same shampoo as me.

31
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,173
This floral green fragrance...
No doubt!

32
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,175
H-Hey now...!

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,846
Well...my coat's shinier.

34
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,724
Don't be saying stupid things
at such an important time!

35
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,143
– I'm the same as a dog?
– Sorry, sorry...

36
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,605
Same as a dog... Same as a dog...

37
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,816
– Hey Sakura?
– Same as a dog...

38
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,150
Same as a dog...

39
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,280
Same as a dog... Same as a dog...

40
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,908
Hey Sakura...!
Wait!

41
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,911
Oh! Hey! Don't go ahead of me!

42
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,625
A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!

43
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,921
Dang it!

44
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,008
Sasuke Uchiha!

45
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
I won't let you get away now!

46
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:04,059
Jeez, this kid of all people...
at a time when Gaara is like this.

47
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,437
Man, this is bad.

48
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,567
Heh! That's fine.

49
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,571
Kankuro! Take Gaara and go quickly!

50
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,744
Leave him to me!

51
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,039
But Temari...!

52
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,583
No matter how you look at it,
you can't beat him alone!

53
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,126
Leave me be!

54
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,045
This is an important mission for
the Village Hidden in the Sand!

55
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,672
Make Gaara the first priority!

56
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,427
Besides, he's quite my type of a guy...

57
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,263
Go! Kankuro!

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,683
I don't think so!

59
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,228
I won't let you get away!

60
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,274
Eat this!

61
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,283
My opponent is that Uchiha kid...

62
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,912
This is not good. I only have
a bit of Chakra left.

63
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,920
I'll stand even less of a chance
if he uses his Sharingan here...

64
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,216
But I need to get him to use
a large amount of Chakra at any cost.

65
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,096
Shall I take care of her in
one hit with Chidori? Or...

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,807
In this situation, maybe I should...

67
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,534
As I thought... He's trying to save
some Chakra for Gaara.

68
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,620
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!

69
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,425
Don't underestimate me!

70
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,093
Ninja Art: Sand Storm!

71
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,606
Darn! I have to do something about
that bothersome fan...

72
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,029
Humph... I wonder how long
you'll last with such a way of fighting.

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,698
It can't be helped...

74
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,289
It looks like you've finally
gotten serious, eh?

75
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,461
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,172
That's the stuff!

77
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,603
Aim with precision!

78
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,314
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

79
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,526
Did I get her?

80
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,489
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

81
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,076
I've got you.

82
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,119
Oh no!

83
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,829
Now!

84
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,459
You're mine!

85
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,343
Good!

86
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,222
W-What?! Substitution?!

87
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,227
Oh no!

88
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,245
Sorry, but I don't have the time
to be dealing with you forever!

89
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,720
D-Dang it...
G-Gaara, at any cost...

90
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,937
What's that?!

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,064
What the heck is going on?

92
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,443
Who the heck is that youth?

93
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,656
Who on earth are you?!

94
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,119
Is it so sudden you can't tell?

95
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,497
It's me. Orochimaru.

96
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:42,462
It can't be... Have you completed
that Forbidden Jutsu?

97
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,347
I struggled for decades...
after leaving the village.

98
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,934
You're a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!

99
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,946
So, he did it, huh...?

100
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,242
The reason I couldn't select you
to be the Fourth Hokage...

101
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,162
is because of that distorted
consciousness.

102
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,750
I've finally been found out, eh...?

103
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,213
It's too bad.

104
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,676
Orochimaru...
What's the meaning of this?!

105
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,930
Here I'd set that
many booby traps...

106
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,100
so I was quite surprised.

107
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,645
But I see... So it was you.

108
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,857
Recently, there has been a steady stream
of people going missing from the village,

109
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,068
from Genin to Chunin,
and even Anbu Black Ops members.

110
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,948
There was also information that
you had been acting strange...

111
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,992
Master Orochimaru...

112
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,369
Why did a Shinobi of your rank
do such a thing?

113
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,331
Shall I kill you, too?

114
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,045
Orochimaru! Sure enough,
this was your doing...?

115
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,590
Say it! What were you doing here?!

116
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,844
Alas! I've been found out.

117
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,596
There's no point in acting cute...

118
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,184
It's for Jutsu development!

119
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,645
Orochi... You!

120
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,564
For that purpose, you did this
to fellow Shinobi...?!

121
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,608
As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh...

122
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,322
What is it that you want?

123
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,033
I want everything!

124
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,368
Everything, you say?!

125
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:31,048
Get every Jutsu and understand
all of the truths of this world!

126
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,843
The one who first mixed
blue and yellow

127
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,930
named the new color made
in that way, green.

128
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,851
I just want to do the same thing.

129
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,188
If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign...

130
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,231
and green is a Jutsu.

131
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,361
In the same way that there
are no limits to the kinds of colors,

132
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,989
there are probably also tens
of thousands of Jutsu in this world...

133
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,951
But in order to get any
and all of the Jutsu...

134
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,916
as well as the truths,
a long time is necessary.

135
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,838
It's the one who takes those
long years to know everything,

136
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,883
who can suitably be called
the ultimate individual.

137
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,931
For me, the life span of
the body is too short.

138
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,641
Too fleeting.

139
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,898
Even if I were to be called the Hokage,
if I die, it all ends there.

140
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:35,153
Orochimaru... Could it be that
the Jutsu you're testing here is...

141
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,365
Right... It sure could be...

142
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,793
Immortality Jutsu!

143
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,638
Immortality Jutsu is a technique of

144
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,892
eternally pooling one's own
spirits into this earth...

145
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,354
In other words,
it's a Revival Jutsu where...

146
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,777
you find a new body, put your own spirit
into that body and take it over.

147
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,743
I assumed my old form until now,

148
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:28,540
so that you would feel nostalgic
about our reunion...

149
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,211
Aging is an empty thing, isn't it?

150
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,382
I feel that keenly when I look at you.

151
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,178
You'll die here...

152
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:46,683
and I'll get a younger,
more beautiful and stronger body...

153
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:51,563
The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun...

154
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,490
I get it...
You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!

155
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,378
Right... Exactly... Sasuke.

156
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,256
A Reviving Jutsu where
someone else's body is stolen

157
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,260
and the spirit is immortalized, huh?

158
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,264
How many faces and bodies
have you gone through?!

159
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,352
Two, I think...

160
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:36,024
I plan to take Sasuke over after
raising him a little more to my liking.

161
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,615
But after all, in order to make you regret
your very own life...

162
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,868
and curse destiny as you die...

163
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,373
...perhaps this face is better?

164
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,460
You monster!

165
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,057
Lord Hokage!

166
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:19,985
Don't lower your guard, Sensei!
You're always too soft...

167
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,829
What's been wrong with you?
This isn't like you!

168
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:31,913
I'm sorry...

169
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,947
Eyes...

170
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,367
Eyes with malice and ambition
concealed in them...

171
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,996
I had noticed that
you had such tendencies.

172
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,334
I had noticed,
but pretended not to know.

173
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,338
It was still during the war-torn era.

174
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,049
A genius who brimmed
over strongly with ability...

175
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,345
Nothing less than a phenomenon
that comes once in several decades.

176
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,514
So I wanted to think that

177
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,894
you would carry on
my own will and power.

178
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,064
That softness on my part...

179
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,652
created the conditions of that time
as well as now!

180
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,948
Are you going to...kill me?

181
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,662
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!

182
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:03,797
I wonder if you can...
Sarutobi Sensei!

183
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,859
Kill him, Sarutobi!
Now's your only chance!

184
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,298
Sarutobi... You...

185
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,719
I couldn't kill him...

186
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:57,892
I'll bury you and correct
my old mistakes, now!

187
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,980
Here I go!

188
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,694
It's too late!

189
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,782
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

190
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,828
No way!
Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!

191
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,330
To disperse the little Chakra
he has left...!

192
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,960
You've gotten old, after all...

193
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,630
To think you'd shorten your
own life span out of impatience...

194
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,883
D-Don't tell me, you...?!

195
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,473
Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi...

196
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,268
This order of Signs...

197
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,896
I knew it, Sarutobi,
you are using that Jutsu!

198
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,665
So this is the Grim Reaper
the Fourth Hokage was talking about,

199
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,629
which only the one who has signed
a contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!

200
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,842
Whatever you do now, it's too late...
I've won.

201
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,594
The Leaf Village will crumble!

202
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,139
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is the home where I live.

203
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:23,937
The Hokage exists as the pillar
to protect that home!

204
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,358
The Hokage is the one who inherits
and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.

205
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,735
I won't go easily!

206
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,823
Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!

207
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,332
Stupid nonsense...

208
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,502
You're merely a temporal head

209
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,047
in the history of the organization
called the Leaf Village...

210
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,476
Even the face rock that is left
will eventually weather and decay.

211
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:09,691
Humph... Leaf Village is
not just an organization to me!

212
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,864
In the Leaf Village,

213
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,158
every year many Shinobi
are born and raised...

214
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:23,705
and live and fight...
and die to protect the village.

215
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,191
The people of this village...

216
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,944
even if they don't have blood ties...

217
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,240
To me, they are precious...

218
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,327
precious...

219
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,204
family!

220
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,592
Then I shall smash you, the pillar,

221
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,803
and destroy the Leaf home.

222
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:27,644
Humph! Even if you kill me,
that pillar will not break!

223
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,942
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages...

224
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,361
The Third Hokage!

225
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,408
No matter how much you target
this Village Hidden in the Leaves...

226
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:48,414
A new Hokage will carry on my will,
shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!

227
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,501
Right, Fourth Hokage?

228
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:58,466
Orochimaru! Now I will perform
an ace Jutsu that even you don't know!

229
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:04,347
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!

230
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

231
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:15,650
It's nothing to be ashamed about

232
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't let this scar be for naught

233
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:26,953
Walk with a smile

234
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:42,593
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

235
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:48,016
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

236
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:53,062
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

237
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:58,317
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

238
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:03,406
Everyone makes mistakes

239
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:08,619
It's nothing to be ashamed about

240
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:13,958
Don't let this scar be for naught

241
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,255
Walk with a smile

242
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:24,385
Transform sadness into the wind

243
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:29,807
and continue to forge on

244
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,521
Forge on strong

245
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,118
Every year in this village,

246
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,539
Shinobi are born, nurtured,
and fight for the sake of the village.

247
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:58,377
They live to protect the village and
things that are precious to them.

248
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:04,467
Even if they aren't related to me,
they are my precious family.

249
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:10,640
I won't let you have your way
with my family!

250
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,893
Next time: "Forbidden Secret Technique:
Reaper Death Seal!"
