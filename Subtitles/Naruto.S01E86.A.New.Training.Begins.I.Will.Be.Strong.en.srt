1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,141
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,728
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,112
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:33,325
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,704
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,458
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,711
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,173
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,010
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,573
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,076
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,705
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,292
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,463
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,929
Well then, Guy.

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,181
I'll leave Sasuke to you.

24
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,564
-Master Jiraiya...
-Hmm?

25
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,819
Be sure to find Mistress Tsunade
and bring her back to...

26
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,531
You bet we'll find her
and bring her right away!

27
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,794
Naruto! I like kids with guts like you!

28
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,170
I'm going to give this to you!

29
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,340
This made Lee stronger...

30
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,551
Huh?! What?! What?!

31
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,309
This is it!

32
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,735
Wow!

33
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,738
They're breathable and moisture-wicking,

34
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,951
and perfectly designed for free movement,
all in a beautiful, stylish package.

35
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,413
You'll notice a difference immediately
if you train with them on!

36
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,373
They're going to grow on you!

37
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,210
Before long, you'll be wanting to
wear them all the time like Lee!

38
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,713
Of course, I have a thing for them, too!

39
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,342
Woooow!

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,809
Why couldn't you bring a mirror
or something

41
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:07,021
instead of carrying around
those things, you dork!

42
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,697
Do you think they'll look good on me?

43
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,745
Don't even think about it.
Get a load of that...

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,082
Now that is truly dorky.

45
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,887
Okay! This is the place!

46
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,557
Here?!

47
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,810
The gambling house frequented
by the entire town...

48
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,119
Your target is Naruto, after all.

49
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,667
To abduct Naruto
is the No.1 priority placed

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,127
by our organization, Akatsuki!

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,635
What's wrong?

52
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,220
Pervy Sage...

53
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,974
Why are they after me?

54
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,397
You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?
Tell me why...

55
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,822
They're not really after you...

56
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,366
They're after what's inside of you.

57
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,828
What on earth is this thing?

58
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,126
It's a horrible demon that
attacked Leaf Village, right?

59
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,294
And was dreaded by all.

60
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,756
So why do they want it so much?

61
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,094
Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox is a demon

62
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,264
that appears at each critical juncture
throughout the ages

63
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,684
destroying everything in its path...

64
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:14,106
And people feared it like
an act of nature.

65
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,408
The reason they want that thing...
for what purpose.

66
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,120
Honestly, I can't quite say.

67
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,001
Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox
is sealed up inside of you...

68
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,211
they might be thinking

69
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:40,215
they want that power in their control.

70
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,264
It must be harsh to know that Ninja
like them would keep coming after you...

71
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,849
But well, that's your destiny!

72
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,560
Now don't you worry,
I'm going to protect...

73
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,354
Then there's nothing to do
but hurry up and get stronger!

74
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,439
I've got to!

75
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,109
Okay!

76
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,695
Let's go find that Tsunade person,

77
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,907
have her save Sasuke
and get down to some serious training!

78
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,328
That's just like this kid...

79
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,918
A New Training Begins: I Will Be Strong!

80
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,053
Th-This place has the highest antes...!

81
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,763
Don't go fretting over every little thing!

82
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
Let's go!

83
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,768
Oh dear! Please wait!

84
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,648
Hmm?

85
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,691
What?

86
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,363
The beautiful woman you
want to "research" on...

87
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,115
That's this Tsunade person?

88
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,576
Whoa! That's sharp coming from you!

89
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,120
And what about it?

90
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,875
She's part of the Sannin thing
like you, right, Pervy Sage?

91
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,086
Yes, and what of it?

92
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,131
How...old is she?

93
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,423
My age.

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,676
Heck, she's an old lady.

95
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,312
Yikes!

96
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,942
Huh?! Th-This woman is...!

97
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,329
Would you mind changing all
of this money into chips for me?

98
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,710
Oh no! She's really going for it!

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,135
Just who is this? This lady...

100
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,970
You don't know?

101
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,015
She's that woman with the famous alias...

102
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,224
Famous alias...?

103
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,272
So, well...what kind of person
is this Tsunade like?

104
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,691
-Oh, you want to know?
-Yeah.

105
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,610
Let's see...

106
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,197
Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.

107
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:13,160
Besides that, she's a diehard gambler
and her face is known far and wide for it.

108
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,370
Then we should have no problems
finding her!

109
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,289
If she's that famous!

110
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,958
She's famous, all right...

111
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,085
Legendary, you might say...

112
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,260
Boss, what's this alias...?

113
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,012
The Legendary...

114
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,513
Legendary...?

115
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,573
Oh dear! They're all laughing!

116
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,581
– Legendary...
– Legendary...

117
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,418
Sitting Duck!

118
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,963
Yup!

119
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,174
But no matter how famous
Legendary Sitting Duck is,

120
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,718
I doubt we'll find her right away.

121
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,595
Why not?!

122
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,806
She hates growing old so much

123
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,559
she's probably used some special Jutsu
to change her appearance.

124
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,396
She's actually 50 years old,

125
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,023
but no doubt she looks like
she did when she was 20...

126
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,736
And not just that, recently I heard that...

127
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,533
she transforms into her teens or
30s or 40s as the situation calls for

128
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,536
to escape moneylenders.

129
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,956
What?! That's a horrible thing to do!

130
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,460
Tsunade has always loved
to gamble more than anything

131
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,463
But she has terrible luck and no skill.

132
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,844
She was always being played
for the Sitting Duck and the name stuck...

133
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,930
Then she was always borrowing money
and skipping out on her debts, too...

134
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,018
Ah, it brings back memories.

135
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,145
This is no time to be
getting all nostalgic!

136
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,148
Tell me, how do you propose
we go about finding her?!

137
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,191
Well...

138
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,860
We may very well have to
put our noses to the ground,

139
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,862
but we're not without our little tricks.

140
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,238
What?!

141
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:17,367
So you have no idea
how long it's gong to take?!

142
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,828
We won't be wasting any time.

143
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,041
All of our time on the road
will be your time.

144
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,293
My time?

145
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,213
Time to make you strong... Training!

146
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,849
Okay!

147
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,976
No, no...

148
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,479
I told you that is definitely out.

149
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,275
I won't be seen walking with someone
dressed like that.

150
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,370
Come on, Pervy Sage!
Let's hurry up and start training!

151
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,081
Now now, don't get ahead of yourself...

152
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,210
The training won't mean anything

153
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,795
unless it's done in the process of
gathering information on Tsunade.

154
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,963
Huh? Gathering information...?

155
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,511
In this town.

156
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,346
Wow!

157
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,152
Cool!

158
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,905
This is my first time
for this kind of thing!

159
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,573
Down time is important, too!

160
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,575
You go have yourself some fun
before we start training.

161
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,537
The festival should continue
for some time.

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,580
We'll stay here in this city
for the duration.

163
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,874
We'll train here, too!

164
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,042
All right!

165
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,847
Whoa! That's a fat wallet! You're rich!

166
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,224
I have quite a bit!

167
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,226
I've saved it little by little
throughout my missions.

168
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,103
Well then!

169
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,063
– Wait! Naruto!
– Huh?

170
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,315
I'll hold on to your wallet for you!

171
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,443
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!

172
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,279
You can spend this much...

173
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,157
What?! Only 300 ryo!

174
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,200
No complaints!

175
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,163
Remember Shinobi must honor
the " Shinobi's Three Taboos"!

176
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,624
Shinobi's Three Taboos...? What's that?

177
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,002
What?! You don't know!

178
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,503
The "three taboos"

179
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,131
are the three temptations
that will bring Shinobi to ruin!

180
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:41,094
The three temptations are
booze, women and money...

181
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,056
Oh, then this doesn't really apply
to me all that much!

182
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,185
I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,520
I don't quite get the women thing!

184
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,939
And I worked so hard
to save all that money,

185
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,483
I don't really feel much like using it...

186
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,318
You fool!

187
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,236
Don't you underestimate
the desire for money!

188
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,988
Once you start using it,
it goes really fast!

189
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,701
Money has a frightful power.

190
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,161
This Tsunade we are going
to be looking for

191
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,080
has ruined herself over it!

192
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,668
Your desire for women is always getting
the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!

193
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,796
I'm going on
an information-gathering mission!

194
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,175
Here, you hold on to my bag for me!

195
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,259
If you get lost,

196
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,846
my tracking SummonsToad
will follow my scent!

197
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,146
He's really just a child after all,
contrary to appearances...

198
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,447
Okay!
First, I'll get a little something to eat!

199
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,994
I'll take one order of
octopus dumplings, sir!

200
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,246
Right!

201
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,665
– Potatoes with butter please!
– You got it!

202
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,000
– I want chocolate bananas.
– Right!

203
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,378
– I want apricot candy!
– Thank you!

204
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,048
– I want okonomiyaki too!
– Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!

205
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,052
One extra-large order
of fried noodle, sir!

206
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,472
Right...But my you've got
a lot of food there, young man!

207
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,766
You don't plan
to eat it all yourself now, do you?!

208
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,519
Eh? As a matter of fact,
I am gong to eat it all myself.

209
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,437
Oh, um, here you go...

210
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,237
I think I ate a bit too much.

211
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,449
I wonder how everyone is?

212
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,994
Kakashi Sensei...

213
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,912
Sasuke...

214
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,789
Sakura...

215
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,502
I'm going to train hard every day
and come back stronger.

216
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,753
Just you wait and see!

217
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,924
But before that...
I better work off that meal!

218
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,884
Last one!

219
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,431
– All right! Perfect!
– Oh! Amazing!

220
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,436
That's the fruit of hard training
throwing shuriken.

221
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,820
You stink, sonny!

222
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,781
Hah! Gosh darn it! Well, just watch this!

223
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,409
-Hold it!
-Huh?

224
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,707
Attention: Shinobi!
Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!

225
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,962
Thanks now!

226
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,385
You shouldn't try to walk around
with the mask on.

227
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,022
It's Pervy Sage's bank saving book.

228
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,776
One, ten, one hundred...

229
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,030
L-Look at all those zeros!

230
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,993
He should be treating me now and then
if he has this much money.

231
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,620
Stingy old geezer!

232
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,253
There's only a little left...
One more stand and that will be it...

233
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,218
Time to make you strong... Training!

234
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,644
Two grilled squids please, sir!

235
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,146
Make one of those an adult size!

236
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,608
Okay! Someone sent you
to buy some squid, eh?!

237
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,152
I'll throw in a child size for free!
Coming right up!

238
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,905
Hurray for you, sir!
You're a man among men!

239
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,448
Oh, you can tell, eh?!

240
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,992
All right! I'll give you
the adult one for half price!

241
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,119
Thanks!

242
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,581
Good grief, where did he go to?!

243
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,545
Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?

244
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,467
Young ladies are so nice.

245
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:54,097
Oh, Naruto! You've already had
you're fill of the festival?

246
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,069
Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!

247
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,531
You're breaking all three at once!
You bastard!

248
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,034
-W-Wait, Naruto...
-N-No, I won't wait!

249
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,663
You used all my hard-saved money!

250
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,623
– Take this and this and this!
– N-Naruto, stop!

251
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,708
I'll pay it all back! I'm sorry, p-please!

252
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,547
You! You!
You made my froggy wallet all flat!

253
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,925
Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!

254
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:39,017
You stained Leader's designer suit!
You'll have to pay for it!

255
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,852
Fork over 100,000 ryo!

256
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,773
What?! You're telling me
that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!

257
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,276
Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
to say a dorky suit like that

258
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,861
cost 100,000 ryo.

259
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,946
Are you asking for it?!

260
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,115
You better put a lid on it
if you know what's good for you.

261
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,285
The leader used be a Chunin from
the Hidden Village of Stones,

262
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:01,206
the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!

263
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,001
Come again? Legendary what?

264
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,129
You seem to want to get hurt!

265
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,089
Naruto.

266
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,342
Perfect timing.

267
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,846
I'll show you a Jutsu now...
Watch very carefully!

268
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,224
Now you've done it!

269
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,108
A-Amazing!

270
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,535
I was holding back quite a bit...
You guys are so weak.

271
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,751
A-Are you? The...legendary...

272
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,755
I'm sorry...
We kind of destroyed your stand...

273
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,383
H-Here... Fix it with this.

274
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,635
Oh! Thanks.

275
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,264
Would you mind if I bought all
your balloons and water balloons

276
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,808
at the same time, my man?

277
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,977
Fine by me...

278
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,148
That wasn't an ordinary hand move...

279
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,443
What in blazes was that?! That Jutsu!

280
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,903
Naruto!

281
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,906
Come with me! It's training time!

282
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,075
Yes, sir!

283
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,545
Finally, the mood is right
for a little training.

284
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,755
– Here! Water balloon!
– Wha...?

285
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,508
Eh?! What is it for?!

286
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,387
You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?

287
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,638
Y-Yeah.

288
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,223
What Jutsu did it look like to you?

289
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,728
It looked like you made
your opponent spin violently.

290
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,648
His perspective's off...
But I guess that's to be expected.

291
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,818
Right, okay... Yes, spinning!

292
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,740
He's spinning the water in the balloon
without moving his hand?!

293
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,077
Whoa!

294
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,913
The tree-climbing exercise

295
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,749
to learn to gather and
maintain Chakra in necessary places...

296
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,959
The Walk-on-Water exercise

297
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,587
to learn how to release
a set amount of Chakra...

298
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,048
You did both of these, right?

299
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,676
And now with this water balloon exercise,

300
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,678
you'll learn how to create
a stream of Chakra...

301
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,805
In other words, spinning.

302
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,017
Create a stream of Chakra...

303
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,561
I'll give a more detailed explanation
of the Jutsu

304
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,481
once you get these first steps down.

305
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,150
First, you must gather
and maintain Chakra in your hand

306
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,735
using the tree-climbing technique.

307
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,697
Then you must continuously release Chakra
using the Walk-on-Water technique.

308
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:45,954
Then you push and churn the water
in the balloon with the Chakra!

309
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,956
I get it!

310
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,583
Then you spin the water
in the balloon faster and faster

311
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,919
until the balloon pops!

312
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,923
You're catching on more and more quickly!

313
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,425
Okay, today we're going
to train until evening!

314
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,510
Yes, sir!

315
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,189
A cycle of hardship, right?

316
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:18,319
Inside, we were crying, right?

317
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,701
But the one thing we won't give up

318
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,328
is the dream we've chosen, right?

319
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,415
It's a secondary role,

320
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,629
a role in the shadows

321
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:41,551
But in reaching for that dream,

322
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,847
let us stay centered, let us stay true

323
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,270
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

324
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:56,941
Over and over, we kept coming back up

325
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:02,822
Over and over,

326
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,076
we believed and dreamed

327
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,540
Over and over, we've seen fools

328
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:17,879
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

329
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,175
Now, it's our turn...

330
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:28,014
Let us bask in our dreams

331
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,777
I will break this water balloon
no matter what!

332
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,279
Hey, you're full of spirit!

333
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,365
Perhaps I can expect him
to master the Jutsu.

334
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,660
The water inside the balloon is moving.

335
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,373
By the way, when does that pop?

336
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,211
Next time: "Keep on Training:
Pop Goes the Water Balloon!"

337
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,462
Aw geez!

338
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,464
Why won't it pop?!
