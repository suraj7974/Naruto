1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,262
A long time ago, a powerful demon fox
appeared with nine tails.

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:12,972
With its powerful tails,

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,559
it could smash mountains
and create tidal waves.

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:21,480
A band of Ninjas rose to
defend their village from attack.

5
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:24,734
We have to wait until
the Fourth Hokage gets here!

6
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,861
We can't let it get any closer
to our village!

7
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:37,329
One great Ninja was able to
imprison the monster,

8
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,291
but died in the process.

9
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:46,338
This Ninja was known as...
the Fourth Hokage.

10
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,647
Naruto!

11
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,941
Why did you do such a thing?!

12
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,110
You're really gonna get it this time!

13
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,117
I don't care!

14
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,787
You know your problem?

15
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,122
You can't do the things I do!

16
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,166
Only I can do this!

17
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,627
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,629
There's a problem, sir!
Lord Hokage!

19
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,589
What is it?

20
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,343
Did that Naruto do something again?

21
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,930
Yes. He climbed onto
the Mountainside Images...

22
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,848
And he vandalized and
graffitied all over them!

23
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,360
Wait!

24
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,614
Ha ha...

25
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,784
Why should I?

26
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,118
Hey, Naruto!

27
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,793
How did you suddenly get here,
Iruka Sensei?

28
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,255
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?

29
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,217
Now listen, Naruto.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,055
You failed the last graduation test
and the one before that.

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,474
This is no time
to be goofing off, you fool!

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
We will have a re-test on
the Transformation Jutsu!

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,649
Even those who already passed
will take it!

34
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,817
Whaaaat?!

35
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,486
Sakura Haruno. Here I go...

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,571
Transform!

37
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,993
OK!

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,704
I did it!

39
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,039
Cha!

40
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,166
Did you see that, Sasuke?

41
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,168
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

42
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,253
Yes.

43
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,343
O-OK.

44
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,931
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

45
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,101
This is a real pain.

46
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,895
And it's all your fault.

47
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,563
Like I care!!

48
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,108
OK...

49
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,571
Good luck, Naruto...

50
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,323
Transform!

51
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,461
How was it?
I call it the "Sexy Jutsu"!

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,924
You fool!
Stop making idiotic spells!

53
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,430
Darn...

54
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:42,932
Darn...

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,518
I won't let you go home
unless you clean that all up.

56
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,730
I don't care...

57
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,441
There's nobody home anyway.

58
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,864
Naruto...

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,867
What is it this time?

60
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,662
What I meant was...

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,333
If you clean up all that mess,
I'll buy you ramen tonight.

62
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,920
Huh?!

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,758
Yes!
I-I will finish it no time!

64
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,011
Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!

65
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,357
Naruto.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,361
Why did you vandalize those faces?

67
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,698
Don't you know who
the Hokage leaders are?

68
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,908
Of course, I do!

69
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,710
I know they earned the title
Lord Hokage

70
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,295
because they were the best Ninja
of their time, right?

71
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,300
Especially the Fourth Hokage
was a hero

72
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,262
who saved the village from
the nine-tail demon fox.

73
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,431
Then why did you do that?

74
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,726
Because I'll become a Hokage myself.

75
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,188
And I'll be the greatest Hokage
of all time!

76
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:18,819
So that everyone will finally
learn to accept me!

77
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:24,033
By the way, Sensei,
I have a favor to ask.

78
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,784
You want another bowl?

79
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,161
Mmmm...No...

80
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,830
Can I borrow that Leaf headband
for a while?

81
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,498
This?

82
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,417
No no!

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,505
This is worn only by those who
have graduated from Ninja Academy.

84
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,466
Tomorrow, you will...

85
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,468
You're so mean!

86
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,471
So that's why you took off
your goggles...

87
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,930
-One more bowl please!
-Humph...

88
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,769
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.

89
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,689
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.

90
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,525
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.

91
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,611
Oh no...

92
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,490
Of all the...! That is my weakest Jutsu!

93
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,705
But still...
I will do it no matter what!

94
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,837
Clone Jutsu!

95
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,306
Disqualified!

96
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,518
Iruka Sensei.

97
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,689
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.

98
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,193
And he managed to come up
with something.

99
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,445
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?

100
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:49,284
Mizuki Sensei...
All the others created three or more clones.

101
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,371
Naruto created just one.

102
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,709
And it's practically useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.

103
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,636
I 'm a Ninja now!

104
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,347
You did well. That's my son.

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,057
Congratulations for your graduation.

106
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,601
I'll cook something good tonight!

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,229
Look at that one.

108
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,358
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.

109
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,111
Serves him right.

110
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,613
Imagine what would happen
if he became a Ninja.

111
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,198
Isn't that the boy
who is actually...

112
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,493
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that.

113
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:43,714
Iruka.
We need to talk later.

114
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,507
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,434
Iruka Sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.

116
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,187
Then why only me?

117
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,693
He wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,029
You both don't have parents.

119
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,659
But I really wanted to graduate.

120
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,955
Heh... I guess I have no choice...

121
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,127
I'll let you in on a big secret.

122
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,464
Secret?

123
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,927
Iruka.

124
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,971
What is it, Lord Hokage?

125
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:37,267
I know how you feel. But...

126
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,939
Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents...like you.

127
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,322
Let me go!

128
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,866
My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!

129
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,996
Wake up, Iruka Sensei!

130
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,167
What's the matter?

131
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,544
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!

132
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,299
I heard that Naruto...
stole the Scroll of Sealing.

133
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,760
The Scroll of Sealing?!

134
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,138
Let's see...

135
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:20,310
The first Jutsu is...
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?

136
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,106
What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?

137
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,150
Lord Hokage!
We can't forgive him!

138
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,318
This is not just a prank!

139
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,614
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!

140
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,116
Depending on its use...

141
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,704
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!

142
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,708
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!

143
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,167
Yes, sir!

144
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,054
Where did you go...Naruto?

145
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,275
I will tell everyone in the village
about this and eliminate Naruto...

146
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,029
Then the Scroll of Sealing
will be mine!

147
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,293
Hey you, Naruto!

148
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,092
You found me..

149
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,220
And I've only learned one Jutsu.

150
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,182
He's been practicing the Jutsu...

151
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,559
until he's become
this exhausted and dirty...?

152
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,979
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!

153
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,148
You're gonna let me graduate
if I can do it!

154
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,693
Isn't it true that I can graduate if
I can do one of the Jutsu written here?

155
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,904
Who told you that?

156
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:59,868
Mizuki Sensei. He told me
about this scroll, and this place...

157
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,373
Mizuki did?!

158
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,755
I'm impressed you found this place.

159
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,050
I see now...how it is.

160
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,723
Naruto, give me that scroll.

161
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,227
Wait, wait...
What's going on here?

162
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,190
Naruto! Never give him that scroll!

163
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,153
It is a dangerous object that contains
forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.

164
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,116
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!

165
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,575
W-Wha...?

166
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,872
Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of
you holding that scroll!

167
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,082
Huh?

168
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,754
What are you saying, Mizuki!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!

169
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,216
I will tell you the truth.

170
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,260
Idiot! Don't do that!

171
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,556
After an incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.

172
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,475
A rule?

173
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:11,440
That is, Naruto, a rule everybody
but you knows.

174
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,694
Except me?!
What is it?

175
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,362
Stop it, Mizuki!

176
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,492
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!

177
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,952
Huh?

178
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,998
You are actually the Demon,
Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

179
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,293
who killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!

180
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,544
Stop it!

181
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,799
Everyone has been
deceiving you ever since.

182
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,594
Didn't you find it strange?

183
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,263
Why everyone hated you so much?

184
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,018
No! No! No! No! No!

185
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,061
Naruto...

186
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:55,525
Nobody accepts you.
That's why Iruka hates you so much!

187
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:02,073
Iruka... Naruto grew up
without the love of parents.

188
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,703
Everyone avoids him like
the plague after what happened.

189
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:12,709
That's why he keeps misbehaving.

190
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:18,673
It's the only way for him to get
any attention or acknowledgement.

191
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:23,178
He pretends to be tough,
but inside he is really hurting.

192
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,096
Die, Naruto!

193
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,059
Naruto!
Get down!

194
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,699
Why...?

195
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,328
Because you and I are the same.

196
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,248
After my parents died,

197
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:56,169
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.

198
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,297
I wasn't a good student in school.

199
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:05,178
I was the class clown...
because I wanted people to notice me.

200
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,768
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.

201
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,565
It was so hard.

202
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,527
Isn't that right, Naruto?

203
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,491
You felt so lonely...right?
And you suffered inside, right?

204
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,953
I'm sorry, Naruto...

205
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:36,459
If I had been more responsible,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.

206
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,422
Don't make me laugh!

207
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:45,635
Iruka has always hated you,
ever since you killed his parents!

208
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,181
He's just saying all that
to get the Scroll of Sealing back!

209
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,436
Naruto!

210
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,814
Narutoooooo!

211
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,278
He is not the type of kid
who will change his mind.

212
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,241
He will take revenge against
our village using that scroll!

213
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,954
Didn't you see his eyes?
Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.

214
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:21,379
No...
Naruto...isn't...like that at all!

215
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,969
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.

216
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,096
I'll take care of you later!

217
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,474
I-I won't let you...

218
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,687
Well, well.

219
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,023
Mizuki has a big mouth!

220
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,610
Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.

221
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,988
He might unleash
the power locked up inside him.

222
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:52,452
The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.

223
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,247
There's a slight chance
he might actually release

224
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,085
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside him!

225
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,003
If that happens...

226
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,674
I've found him!

227
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,593
Naruto!

228
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,387
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!

229
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,849
Give me that scroll, quick!
Mizuki is after the scroll!

230
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,367
It can't be...

231
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,709
Why is it, Naruto?

232
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,169
How...

233
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,631
did you know I wasn't Iruka...?

234
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,637
Because I'm Iruka.

235
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,598
I see.

236
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,855
What's in it for you to protect
the one who killed your family?

237
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,358
I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot
like you get that scroll!

238
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,779
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.

239
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,240
Same?

240
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,536
Anyone can do whatever
he wants once he has the scroll.

241
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,996
There is no way that that monster...

242
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,459
that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!

243
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,252
You're right...

244
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,841
I guess it was true all along!

245
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:36,681
See, Iruka Sensei never really
cared for me at all!

246
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,683
...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.

247
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,645
But Naruto is different!

248
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:48,067
I know that he is an exceptional student.

249
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,195
He works very hard,

250
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:54,073
and he's single-minded
and clumsy at the same time.

251
00:17:54,157 --> 00:18:00,538
No one accepts him, but he knows
the meaning of human suffering.

252
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,166
He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.

253
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,502
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

254
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,843
You are so gullible.
Iruka!

255
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,138
I was gonna take you down later,
but I have changed my mind.

256
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,349
Die!

257
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,227
I guess this is the end for me...

258
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,985
Naruto?!

259
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,448
You surprised me there, freak.

260
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,371
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

261
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,209
Shut up! I can take care of a kid
like you with a single blow!

262
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:51,089
Why don't you try then?
I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!

263
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,343
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

264
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,346
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

265
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,190
Naruto! You've...

266
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:15,947
Those aren't just images but actual clones!
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!

267
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,117
What's this...?

268
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,828
What's the matter?
C'mon!

269
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,123
Weren't you gonna get me
with one blow? Here!

270
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,084
In that case...
I'll come to you.

271
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:49,105
I kinda got carried away.
Iruka Sensei, are you okay?

272
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,065
Yeah.

273
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,235
He's really something.

274
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,404
Maybe it is true.

275
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,531
Maybe he will surpass all
the Hokage leaders...

276
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:05,496
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

277
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,085
Has anyone found Naruto yet?

278
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,337
No.

279
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,256
Darn, this is going to be bad...

280
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,217
There's no need to worry anymore.

281
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,179
Lord Hokage!

282
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,599
He'll be back soon.

283
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,102
Sensei, how much longer?

284
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,480
OK, you may open your eyes now.

285
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,953
Congratulations...on your graduation.

286
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:54,504
In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!

287
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,346
Iruka Sensei!

288
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,098
That hurts!

289
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,225
Naruto...

290
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,769
I was going to lecture to you...

291
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,398
that the road gets more difficult
now that you're a Ninja.

292
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,403
But I guess I'll just wait to tell you
that until we get to the ramen stand...

293
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,626
W-What do you want, you little shrimp?
Quit following me!

294
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,503
You're smaller than me and

295
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,879
you're saying that you're gonna
become the Fifth Hokage?

296
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,925
I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's
grandson or not.

297
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,177
It's not that easy to be a Hokage!

298
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,932
If you want it that bad,
you're gonna have to beat me first!

299
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,768
Next episode:
"My Name Is Konohamaru!"

300
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,938
Watch my outstanding performance!
