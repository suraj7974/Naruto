1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,583
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,303
The Dark Creeping Clouds

16
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,894
Come...come...come...

17
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,943
The villagers are welcoming us.

18
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,569
Everyone seems to be safe.

19
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,532
It seems like the Kurosuki Family
ran away in fear.

20
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,131
Hey...

21
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,676
Here they come!

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,594
Naruto! Don't come...

23
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,222
If you value your life,
be quiet.

24
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,099
Karashi...

25
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,935
I heard that you were deeply sorry
for your actions...!

26
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,814
How could I shamelessly
run back to the curry house?!

27
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,109
Now!

28
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,763
Did you see that?!

29
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,310
Although Master Raiga is not around,
the Kurosuki Family is eternal!

30
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,148
Hey...what are you looking for?

31
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,735
Isn't it obvious? The brats!

32
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,528
Are you referring to us?

33
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:15,738
What?!

34
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,204
What you crushed were our forms

35
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,249
made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,293
Take formation!

37
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,381
Ninja Art: Black Tornado!

38
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,306
Wha...?

39
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,144
Those were also made by

40
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,355
the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu!

41
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,026
We saw through everything!

42
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,277
Here I go.

43
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,427
Leaf Hurricane!

44
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,019
Disperse!

45
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,610
Byakugan!

46
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,497
2 palms! 4 palms!

47
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,416
8 palms!
16 palms!

48
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,379
32 palms!

49
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,424
8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

50
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,972
Here I come!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

51
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,981
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

52
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,444
Huh?! Oww...

53
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,697
It's already over...

54
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,699
What?! Not fair!

55
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:09,119
Man! You could've saved
some for me!

56
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,372
Just when I thought
I'd try the new Jutsu!

57
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,923
Gosh, you never learn, do you!

58
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,884
Karashi, are you prepared?

59
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,803
I was just kidding!

60
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,555
How dare you torment us!

61
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,724
You really think
we'll let this slide as a joke?

62
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:34,186
I couldn't help it! If I didn't listen,

63
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,522
I would have gotten killed
by the Kurosuki family.

64
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,941
In place of the Kurosuki family,

65
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,568
I'll crack your head
with this hammer!

66
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,820
Yeah! Yeah!

67
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,864
I'm sorry...

68
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,158
Please move, Lee!

69
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,370
Please hit me until
you guys are satisfied.

70
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,913
Why you?

71
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,209
It's partly my responsibility

72
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:01,463
that the once kind-hearted Karashi
went and joined a gang.

73
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,382
Yours?

74
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,008
Because of me,

75
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,761
he got the impression
that power is everything.

76
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,555
Right, that's right!

77
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,224
Though I knew that it's a bad thing,
I just had to...

78
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,642
You be quiet!

79
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,645
Karashi is still inexperienced.

80
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,358
But he has skills to make curry
that can save people's lives.

81
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,070
Please give Karashi the opportunity
to make amends by making curry.

82
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:31,535
If Karashi goes astray again,
then I will...!

83
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,456
Punish him with my fists!

84
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,962
Everyone, what do you think

85
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,548
about letting Lee and Grandma Sansho
take care of this situation...

86
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,596
After all, he was just
an underling of the Kurosuki family.

87
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,391
It's not like he directly
attacked us or anything...

88
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,021
Let's have Lee educate him harshly...

89
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,106
In that case...

90
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,905
Thank you very much!

91
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,781
Th-Thank you...

92
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,076
And with this, our mission is complete.

93
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,245
-No, not yet...
-Huh?

94
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,099
Are you all right?

95
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,437
What's the point of being all right?

96
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,856
I can't live alone.

97
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,983
Don't say that!

98
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,110
Why don't we just
leave this weakling!

99
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,738
Everyone has to live alone!

100
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,492
But don't you need friends
who can help you and stuff...?

101
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,829
I'm talking about some basics!
I hate people who are indecisive!

102
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,125
I was frail
from the time I was born.

103
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,505
That shabby cabin was
the entire world for me.

104
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,595
I have no memory of my parents...

105
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,764
I survived only by
the small amount of food

106
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:20,185
that the villagers sometimes
brought me...

107
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:28,443
But even someone like me
had a power that no one else did.

108
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,510
Here you go.

109
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,388
Thank you...

110
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,933
Is your leg okay?
The one you cut with the scythe?

111
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,728
D-Did I tell you that story?!

112
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,188
No...I kind of found out...

113
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:11,194
How? No one else besides me
came today or yesterday, right?

114
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,281
No, I just saw it from here...

115
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,784
Scary!

116
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,955
As time went by everyone began
to fear me since I had the power

117
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,375
to know what was happening outside
even from my room.

118
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,880
Did you know?!

119
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,050
I heard that Ranmaru has
the ability to see everything...

120
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,886
Were we being spied on every day?

121
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,599
Get out of the village!

122
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,392
You monster!

123
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,313
And so I had no more visitors...

124
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,440
All I could do was to wait to die.

125
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,153
That's when Raiga saved me...

126
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,703
I see. What a bitter past.

127
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,830
Yes, it is.

128
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,837
Raiga took me out to
the unknown world.

129
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,595
Ranmaru, try opening your eyes...

130
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:26,770
This is the outside world where
we'll be living from now on...okay?

131
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,939
Okay...

132
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,863
If Raiga isn't here,
it's the same as losing my body.

133
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,825
Perhaps Raiga became known

134
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,328
as one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist

135
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,289
because he was able
to borrow your power.

136
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,751
It seems like you two
helped each other to live...

137
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,336
Yes.

138
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,004
That's not true!

139
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,383
You were being used for
Raiga's evil deeds!

140
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,595
I might have been...used...

141
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:08,228
But good or bad doesn't matter to me.
I'm just a sense organ...

142
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,232
Then that won't mean
that you're really living!

143
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,900
Huh?

144
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,612
See, you have to do your best
to live from now on!

145
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,409
Firstly, eat the curry of life
and cheer up!

146
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,953
That's right!
You will get nourishment.

147
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,832
That will hurt the body instead,
wouldn't it?

148
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,294
Naruto, you can't eat it either, right?

149
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,589
Actually, the more I eat it,

150
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,176
the more energized my body feels...

151
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,304
That curry saved my life, you know!

152
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,101
Until the day you're able
to walk alone,

153
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,978
I will become your body!

154
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,521
Okay?

155
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,066
I have one favor to ask...

156
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,193
Huh...?

157
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,503
Byakugan!

158
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,808
As I expected...
I can no longer see life in Raiga.

159
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,685
Can you see, Ranmaru?

160
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,730
Yes.

161
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,655
-Is this okay?
-Yes...

162
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,408
Let's go... Mission is complete.

163
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,545
Hey!

164
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,175
-What?
-That is...!

165
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,306
One, two, one, two.

166
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,599
Grandma Sansho!

167
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,063
What's all this ruckus?!
Dust will go into the curry.

168
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,024
L-Lee and the others came back!

169
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,318
K-Karashi is with them!

170
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,613
Is it worth the ruckus?

171
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,284
Grandma, aren't you happy?

172
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,245
One, two... One, two...

173
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,582
Your snot will go in!

174
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,712
Grandma Sansho! I'm back!

175
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,008
Karashi is here too!

176
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,977
M-Mom, sorry!
Please forgive me!

177
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,563
Please forgive him...

178
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,690
He says he'll devote himself
from now on,

179
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:02,611
and train to take over
the Curry of Life Shop, so please...

180
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,493
First you gotta eat...

181
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,582
Wow, it looks good!

182
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,752
If you're not going to eat, I will!

183
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,339
I've prepared some for each of you...

184
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,967
Oh my, that's a very pale child.

185
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,596
Yeah, can you prepare
some for him too?

186
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,723
Especially mild...

187
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,933
I prefer mild too...

188
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,894
Oh my...

189
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,402
Mom...thanks for the food!

190
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,242
It's a punishment times 300 curry...

191
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,831
It's spicy, it's spicy...

192
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,793
But it's good! It's good, Mom!

193
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,759
Here, I have some for everybody!

194
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,143
It's okay, it's mild.

195
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,442
By the way, you were part of

196
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,404
the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist with Raiga, right?

197
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,197
Do you know a guy
named Zabuza?

198
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,117
Zabuza...you say?

199
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,244
Uh then...

200
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,414
How about a guy with this huge sword
wrapped with something like a bandage

201
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,623
and has fish eyes?

202
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,584
Oh...that's Kisame...

203
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,586
Yeah Kisame!

204
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,006
So, do you know what
he's up to right now?

205
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,635
No... I heard that he slipped out
from the Mist Village.

206
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,222
I know his face, but I don't know
anything beyond that.

207
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,392
I see...

208
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,272
Should I ask Grandma to
make you something else?

209
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:07,235
No, I don't need it...
I don't want to eat anything.

210
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,577
Thank you for your help...

211
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,162
Thank you very much.

212
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,085
Make a good village with everyone!

213
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,546
Um...where is Lee?

214
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,758
His mission still isn't complete.

215
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:42,020
Please wait, Lee... I'm gonna die!

216
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,189
Okay, let's take a break here!

217
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,610
Let's do 300 push ups.

218
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,694
What?!

219
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,574
One, two...

220
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:59,829
One, two...

221
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,247
300...all right.

222
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,127
It looks like...
there's going to be a storm.

223
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,343
Even if a real storm comes,

224
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,513
it should be fine if we reinforce it
with these big trees!

225
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,557
Oh my, thanks for doing this.

226
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,185
No, it's our thanks for the curry.

227
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,398
But compared to you guys,
my Karashi is...

228
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,903
Tenten? I'm worried about
Karashi and Ranmaru

229
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,030
whom we left behind
at the curry shop.

230
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,450
We're okay,
so could you check on them there?

231
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,413
Karashi?!

232
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,883
Hey...
Is the Boss really still alive?

233
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:58,304
That Neji person didn't seem
to sense it then...

234
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,014
But I know.

235
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,291
Raiga...

236
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,758
You were everything to me!

237
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,094
I was only waiting to die...

238
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,721
when you told me that
we'll live on together!

239
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:59,949
To me, being with you, was living...

240
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,454
I won't hold a funeral for you either.

241
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,500
Even if it costs me my life,
I won't let you die!

242
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,972
Ranmaru!

243
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,812
Did you die, Ranmaru?!

244
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,666
Karashi...?

245
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,699
So many things happen

246
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:28,496
on this endless road, huh?

247
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:34,043
Although you're strong-willed,

248
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

249
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,303
What dreams

250
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:51,310
did you chase to get here?

251
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:56,357
Even I have times

252
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:03,322
when I just don't understand, baby

253
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,995
When you're sad,

254
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:14,751
I'll be close to you

255
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:20,590
Even on nights when we're apart,

256
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

257
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:32,685
I'll be close to you

258
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,693
What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!

259
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,403
Then we gotta go save her
right away!

260
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,946
Please calm down! Naruto!

261
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,907
Tenten can't be that clumsy.

262
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,659
Huh? But that's what Karashi said.

263
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,287
Unfortunately, this might be
some kind of trap.

264
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,372
What? Trap?

265
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,707
Karashi...

266
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,086
Well, didn't they get annihilated?

267
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,214
