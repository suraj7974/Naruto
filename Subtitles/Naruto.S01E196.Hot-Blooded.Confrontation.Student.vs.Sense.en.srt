1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,920
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,195
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,498
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,734
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,496
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,200
So it's a case of not being able to fight
with the leader

17
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,786
unless I defeat the underlings?

18
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,120
Well then!

19
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,544
Hot-Blooded Confrontation:
Student vs. Sensei

20
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,882
So you think you've blackened the path
to this Might Guy's tomorrow with this?

21
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:16,971
Youth is breaking through
the walls that close you in...

22
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,057
If you have both passion and effort,
then nothing is impossible!

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,350
With my sights trained on tomorrow...!

24
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,317
Is there no tomorrow for us...?

25
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,363
So this wood retains
its incredible strength

26
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,533
because it is reinforced and
connected by Chakra, I see.

27
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,703
Guy Sensei...

28
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,912
Yagura?

29
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,289
Are you all right?!

30
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,254
I'm not Yagura...

31
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,053
Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,
Gensho!

32
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,930
Second son of the same, Rokkaku!

33
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,515
Third son, Jako!

34
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,560
Ryudouin?

35
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,772
Hmm... I think I've heard
of that somewhere...

36
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,608
Don't tell me that you don't remember!

37
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,154
Our father, Agira Ryudouin,
was deeply injured

38
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,700
by the cowardly strategies of you
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

39
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,788
And unable to execute his missions,
he passed away in despair.

40
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,875
Our father resented you to the very end,

41
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,920
even muttering your name
on his deathbed...

42
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:35,090
telling us to fight with
Might Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.

43
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,175
From that day forth,

44
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:40,387
our objective
has been to avenge his death!

45
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:45,100
Yes! We have been lying in wait for
the time when we could get even with you!

46
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,103
Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!

47
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,691
There's no way I could forget that battle.

48
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:56,779
Although we were enemies
on our missions, Agira was a fine man...

49
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,824
That will remain in my memory as
a splendid contest, even within

50
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,576
the annals of
the complete eight-volume

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,495
"Might Guy's History of Famous Battles."

52
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,086
It was a man-to-man fight.

53
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,386
Nothing happened that dishonored
my Way of Ninja!

54
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,930
You three must be mistaken.

55
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,849
I won't be angry at you,
so let me out of here!

56
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,687
Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon
you to settle my father's score...

57
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,855
I'll finish you off!

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,420
Sakura...

59
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,215
I noticed you were there some time ago.

60
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,720
My master told me to
make sure you don't overdo it.

61
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,596
You're hiding something, aren't you?!

62
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,391
N-No... Nothing!

63
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,729
Sakura, you're not very good at lying...

64
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,069
What?

65
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,205
Die, Might Guy!
Enemy of our father!

66
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,169
Wait, I tell you!

67
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,923
Hey, you Yagura imposter.
Infiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,

68
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,675
what are you scheming?!

69
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,512
Byakugan!

70
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:54,480
Guy is in that building!
The building is controlled by their Chakra!

71
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,898
Why you...!

72
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,746
Intense Brow Sensei,
I'm coming to your rescue!

73
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,210
Wh-What is this?!

74
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,343
Do you intend to shut us in
with these pieces of wood?

75
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,179
Don't underestimate us!

76
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,639
Stop it, Naruto!

77
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,153
Wooden Dummies for training?

78
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,118
Are these also controlled by those three?

79
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,244
However strong they are,

80
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,122
they couldn't move all of
these Wooden Dummies at once.

81
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,251
It's hard to believe those three would
have that much power.

82
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,836
Byakugan!

83
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,510
I see.

84
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,096
They have a simple mechanism,

85
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,641
and their movements are controlled by
the labels stuck to the back of their heads.

86
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,227
So, they're not moved with Puppet Jutsu?

87
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,064
No, they're only designed for
repeated punches and kicks,

88
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,066
so they probably cannot respond
to our movements!

89
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,861
Does this mean their movements
can be halted by removing the labels?

90
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,196
So that's what it's all about!

91
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,492
If that's the case,
then I'll return that blow!

92
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,953
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

93
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,583
Here goes!

94
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,390
Once I know the weak spot,
you're all mine!

95
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,316
– Gotcha!
– Gotcha!

96
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,407
Hah! This is easy!

97
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,953
These Wooden Dummies are
just one small part of our Jutsu!

98
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,916
Ninja Art:
Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!

99
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,720
Damn you!

100
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,016
Keep your wits about you!

101
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,893
There's one that moves differently
from the others!

102
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,855
Neji!

103
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,199
U-zu-ma-ki...

104
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,952
Naruto Barra...!

105
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,458
Stay back!

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,712
Some of these Wooden Dummies seem
to be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.

107
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,797
Be careful!

108
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,278
– Lee!
– Bushy Brow!

109
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,822
Leaf Hurricane!

110
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,323
Lee?!

111
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,575
How did you know we were here?!

112
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,160
From what Sakura told us,

113
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,329
I felt certain that Guy Sensei
would take this route

114
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,332
if he were headed for
the Land of Mountain Streams.

115
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,793
And where is Guy Sensei?

116
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,962
Inside there.

117
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,310
What?

118
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,602
A-Are they running away?

119
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,198
What's happening?!

120
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,924
It's just like a castle!

121
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,885
Leave this to me!

122
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,640
Guy Sensei is my master!
I would risk my life to save him!

123
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,811
But, Bushy Brow,
your leg injury hasn't healed yet.

124
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,355
I'm going in!

125
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,856
It's reckless!

126
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,820
Do you intend to interfere?

127
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,032
Today, I am just
a bit different from usual...!

128
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,453
Bushy Brow, we'll cover you.

129
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,790
There is a weak point in
the Chakra at the center of the castle.

130
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,083
If you hit there, then...

131
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,251
But it may be a trap!

132
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,840
Everyone... If it is a trap,
let's try falling into it intentionally.

133
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,100
Over there!

134
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,811
Dynamic Entry!

135
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,194
As we suspected,
it was a trap to lure me in.

136
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,739
Anyway, let's follow it through.

137
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,666
Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.

138
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,792
All right.

139
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,462
Take revenge on that coward
by a suitable method.

140
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,965
Leave it to me...

141
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,635
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!

142
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,399
A Wooden Dummy here too?

143
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,944
Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee...

144
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,447
Is that Yagura's voice I hear?

145
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,282
I'll teach you both,
master and student,

146
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,661
that sometimes passion and
effort alone come to naught.

147
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,205
I won't allow you to
speak ill of my teacher.

148
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,498
If you've got something to say,

149
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,125
then why don't you come out here
and say it?

150
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,960
There is no need.

151
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,755
I can amply prove it with
the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.

152
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,133
I have come to rescue my teacher!

153
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,802
There's no way
I'm going to let myself lose to you!

154
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,221
You make me laugh...

155
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,269
What's this? The Leaf Hurricane...?

156
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,689
Does this mean that the technique
I deployed that time

157
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,525
has been completely imitated
and mastered by Yagura?!

158
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,528
In that case...

159
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,698
Leaf Great Hurricane!

160
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,747
Can this really be Yagura?

161
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,165
If he's mastered not
only offensive moves,

162
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,126
but also learned to guard with
such perfection

163
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,378
then he truly must be a genius!

164
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,423
What an incredibly
powerful spinning kick...

165
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,633
The Gensho I faced off with
in the practice hall

166
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,718
did not have this much power.

167
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:22,928
To my knowledge,

168
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,848
there is only one person who
could let loose this powerful a kick.

169
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,644
They are student and teacher
who respect each other.

170
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,687
Dying in fighting each other must
be a wish come true.

171
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,022
We'll have them crush each other

172
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,399
with Wooden Dummies mimicking
each other's movements.

173
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,904
Even if each were to discover
the true identity of his opponent...

174
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,865
They can't escape from the confrontation

175
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,409
without defeating
the Wooden Dummies before their eyes.

176
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,161
That is the secret of

177
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,872
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!

178
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,379
Looks like my legs
can't last for very long...

179
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,799
If it comes to this,
there's only one move left.

180
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,884
Guy Sensei, it's okay right?

181
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,304
If I use it for your sake,
you'll probably forgive me.

182
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,564
The Lotus?

183
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,109
Could it be that the one who is controlling
this Wooden Dummy is Lee?

184
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,744
Dancing Leaf Shadow!

185
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,757
A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back
to aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

186
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,220
It's magnificent...
Too magnificent!

187
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,682
Only Guy Sensei could use
such artful techniques!

188
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,310
Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,

189
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,646
I'm 100% certain that he would have
toppled the opponent with that Lotus.

190
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:02,360
But, at this rate,
I won't be able to beat this Jutsu...

191
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,031
Wait! There is a way.

192
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:22,005
That tapping is Morse Code.
"You and I are destroying each other..."

193
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,383
But there's no way for either
of us to end this fight

194
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,344
without defeating the enemy's Jutsu...

195
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,389
So, it was Guy Sensei that
I was fighting all along?

196
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,061
We must both create an attack
with speed and power

197
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,813
of a magnitude that cannot be
reproduced by the Wooden Dummies...

198
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:43,860
"But I cannot show to you
the abyss of death again!"

199
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,996
Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person
who is most important to me...

200
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,918
"You will forgive me for using
that move, won't you?

201
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:04,255
"To me..."
"To me..."

202
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:13,640
"To me, there is no one more important
than Guy Sensei," you say?

203
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:19,104
Lee! What do you mean by
making me cry at a time like this?

204
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,608
Lee! I haven't forgotten the promise
I made to you back then!

205
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:30,573
"If you die...I shall die with you."

206
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,620
Thank you, Guy Sensei!

207
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,622
Now is the very time when...

208
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,583
one's own Way of Ninja...

209
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,837
– must be followed to the very end!
– must be followed to the very end!

210
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,048
Third Gate: Gate of Life... Open!

211
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,594
Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain... Open!

212
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,605
Guy Sensei!

213
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,023
We're far from finished!

214
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,953
What's wrong, Elder Brother?

215
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,082
They're fast. They're both too fast...

216
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,254
At this rate,
the Wooden Dummies will...break.

217
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,506
Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!

218
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,841
Open!

219
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,431
I can't see them.
They're faster even than sound!

220
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,234
There you go, Lee!

221
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,987
Bring the Chakra of your passions
to bear upon your opponent!

222
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,572
Right!

223
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,697
– The castle is...
– ...crumbling?

224
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,307
If this was revenge,

225
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,269
then why did you not come at me
with the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?

226
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:11,025
That day, though he was
the only man left,

227
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,361
your father refused to surrender,

228
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,364
but fairly and sportingly confronted me
with Kung Fu.

229
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:25,290
Out of respect to your father,
I faced him one to one.

230
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,711
When the fight was finished,
your father smiled slightly,

231
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,005
as if satisfied, and said he would like
to fight again...

232
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,642
Whether or not you believe me,
this is all there was to it.

233
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,857
Could it be that
what Father wanted to say

234
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,068
was not that he wanted us
to defeat Master Guy,

235
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,530
but that he wanted to fight again,
fairly and squarely?

236
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,659
Have we had the wrong idea all along?

237
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:06,164
I learned something important from
your father in that fight.

238
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,585
It is not the people born with
natural gifts who are the lucky ones;

239
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,297
the truly fortunate are they who,
believing in themselves to the very end,

240
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,592
can go on striving and keep the flame
of their passions alive because of it.

241
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,686
Uh-huh.
That's a good teacher-student relationship.

242
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,438
Naruto!

243
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:37,820
Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get
Bushy Brow to Grandma's place, will you?

244
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,781
Got it! Get him to the stretcher.

245
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,659
No, don't worry about me.
I'm okay. See to Yagura first.

246
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,664
Speaking of which,
I still haven't asked of Yagura's real name.

247
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,125
Lee, there'll be plenty of tim
for that later.

248
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,670
Administering first-aid
should take priority.

249
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,004
Yes! Guy Sensei!

250
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,799
Yup, yup... That is really one
super teacher-student relationship.

251
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,385
I wish mine was as good...

252
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,921
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

253
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,690
Yo, Kiba, Neji!

254
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,192
As always, you have
no sense for tension.

255
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,152
– What was that?!
– Be quiet, you guys.

256
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,529
That's right. They are about to
give us important instructions.

257
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,782
– Okay...
– Choji too! Can't you eat a little later?

258
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,909
– I don't mind.
– That's not the point at all!

259
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,160
N-Naruto... Um... I...

260
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,745
Things are heating up in here,
aren't they, Sakura?

261
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,705
You are getting too excited.
Hey. We're all here.

262
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,583
Then, I'll explain the next mission.

263
00:22:55,666 --> 00:23:00,713
Next time:
"Crisis: The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather!"
