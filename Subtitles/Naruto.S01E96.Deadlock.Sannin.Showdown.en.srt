1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,237
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,662
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:43,461
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,986
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,782
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,755
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,731
Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,402
Oh! Dad!

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,415
This isn't good!
Oh no, Gamatatsu! Let's get out of here!

23
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,876
What? Why, why?

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,628
It doesn't matter, just hurry up!

25
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:22,059
Manda and Orochimaru, Katsuyu and Tsunade...

26
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,896
They all bring back memories...

27
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:35,197
Shall we have a reunion
or something, Jiraiya?

28
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,409
Fool! I summon you after a long absence

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,161
and you make these boring jokes.

30
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,457
The time to conclude this long,
fateful confrontation has come.

31
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,753
I'm bringing Orochimaru down,
here and now!

32
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,050
Hey Orochimaru...

33
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:59,305
Why'd you have to summon me
to a place like this?!

34
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,521
You... I'm going to eat you up!

35
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,982
Don't say that, Lord Manda...

36
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,734
You will be duly rewarded.

37
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,987
Who said I'm talking to you?!

38
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,741
Don't be so flippant, brat!

39
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,080
Hey, Orochimaru...

40
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:29,668
I expect you to prepare
a sacrificial offering of 100 people later.

41
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,506
Though Lord Orochimaru is Manda's master,

42
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,259
if Manda learns that Lord Orochimaru
can't use Jutsu,

43
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,762
Manda will no doubt double-cross him.

44
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,849
Despite the fact that he had
no other choice, in his condition,

45
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,518
it was too risky for Lord Orochimaru
to summon Manda.

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,065
Katsuyu... take that kid to Shizune!

47
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,525
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,080
All right! I can fight, too!

49
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,211
Shizune, please take care of this child.

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,089
Naruto...

51
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,301
Also, the battle is going to get
quite vicious from now.

52
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:24,556
Please go far away with my clone
and conceal yourself...

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,061
That's what Lady Tsunade wants.

54
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,814
Lady Tsunade...

55
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,747
You...

56
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,960
I'll hang you out until you're dry!

57
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:57,881
I've been wanting a snakeskin wallet...

58
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:06,181
Orochimaru,
you've sunk too deeply into vice!

59
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,600
We are no longer comrades.

60
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,352
Comrades?

61
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,106
That word makes me shiver.

62
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,151
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!

63
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,211
Acid Slime!

64
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,056
I'll start with this one!

65
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,411
Katsuyu!
Lady Tsunade...

66
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,474
Here they come!
I know!

67
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,487
Tsunade! Stay away!

68
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,864
Bunta! Give me some oil!

69
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,491
Okay!

70
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,871
Fire Style!

71
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,790
Toad Oil Flamethrower!

72
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,146
Humph... How's that? Did it work?

73
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,069
No, that's...

74
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,828
Molten skin! He shed his skin!

75
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,253
Bunta! Under the earth!
What?!

76
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,757
It's the tail?!

77
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,018
Keep it shut!

78
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,897
They're Sannin, all right.

79
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,940
Dealing with two of them is rough.

80
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,820
Tsunade!

81
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,283
Well now, I can kill you
by wringing your neck.

82
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,661
My Chakra...

83
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,206
At this rate...

84
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,709
Even though you say
you won't die in battle,

85
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,962
you won't have a choice if
I rip your neck off...

86
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,672
Right, Tsunade?

87
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,176
How many minutes...

88
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,886
How many seconds can I hold on...?

89
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,806
I have to put it on the line!

90
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,230
Fine!

91
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,274
It's about time we put an end to this!

92
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,278
R-Ridiculous!

93
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,714
Not done yet!

94
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,315
Take this!

95
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,572
Darn it...!

96
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,664
Lady Tsunade... Not that...!

97
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,625
She's reached her limit...

98
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,127
No...

99
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,262
This guy...

100
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,639
I've hurled him around that much,
yet he's still...

101
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,151
So this is as far as you can go.

102
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,821
Shut up!

103
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,576
Don't rest!

104
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,911
Keep beating him.

105
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,712
This is the battle...

106
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,505
where I put my life on the line!

107
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,386
Lord Orochimaru!

108
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,557
I won't let you go!

109
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,352
You will stay with me until the end!

110
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,732
Take this!

111
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,169
I hit him and hit him.
Something's different...

112
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,382
What is it?
This...strange sense of discomfort?

113
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,247
However, with this...!

114
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,920
It's over!

115
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,974
He took a direct hit!

116
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,437
That was it.

117
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,604
Yeah...

118
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,569
Lord Orochimaru...

119
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,791
Putting me in this position!

120
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,419
I want to eat you and kill you,

121
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,089
but I can't even chew you up
with this hole in my mouth...

122
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,927
Next time, if we meet again, be prepared!

123
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,668
Tsunade...

124
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:19,925
Even though you won't heal me,
I still have one way.

125
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,727
A way to resurrect these arms.

126
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:42,280
The Leaf Village...
I'll destroy it...without fail.

127
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,036
At that time, it would be nice
if we could meet again...

128
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:55,043
My comrades... Tsunade and Jiraiya.

129
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,630
That face...?!

130
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,718
In some way or another,
he took someone else's body...?!

131
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,055
No wonder, when we went at it a while ago,

132
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,475
I didn't get the same feeling
from him that I did in the past...

133
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,940
The true elixir of life.

134
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,692
That's my...

135
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,318
my immortality!

136
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,990
Some day, in the future...

137
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,329
Wait!

138
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,002
The bones in my ribs and feet are broken...

139
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,677
The side effects of the Jutsu
are starting...

140
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,890
My body is...already...

141
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:22,213
Tsunade, you haven't changed.
You're no good at wagers.

142
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,178
The Hokage is my dream!

143
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,847
I'll give you one week.

144
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,683
If you can master that Jutsu,

145
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,935
I'll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage...

146
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,937
and give you this necklace.

147
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,607
It's no joke!

148
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,568
If I have three days,
I'll master this Jutsu!

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
Men don't go back on their word!

150
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,746
I'm the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so...!

151
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,917
You said it.
Men don't go back on their word!

152
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,880
Right! I'll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!

153
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,885
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

154
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:17,394
I love this village and my comrades.

155
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,978
So I want to protect them.

156
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,609
An existence that protects everyone.

157
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,697
Becoming the Hokage is my dream...

158
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,871
I'd like you... to take this.

159
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,463
Any time now, the side effects...

160
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,424
Lady Tsunade...

161
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,472
You...

162
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,437
It's nothing... If I rest a bit, I'll return
to my young form.

163
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,189
I'll rest in town.

164
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,443
And when Naruto wakes up,
We'll return to Konoha.

165
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,111
Tsunade...

166
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,991
Starting now, don't call me Tsunade.
Call me...

167
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,661
The Fifth Hokage?!

168
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,918
Old Lady Tsunade is
the Fifth Hokage starting today...

169
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,839
What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.

170
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,676
After all, compared to the old man,
the Third Hokage,

171
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,595
there's something...

172
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,724
rough-natured and kind of selfish...

173
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,102
loose with money, catty and stupid...

174
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,857
Somehow, I'm going to worry
if she can do it properly.

175
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,320
Lady Tsunade, would you like
to order something...

176
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,991
Moreover, a 50-year-old lady
transforming into a young lady...

177
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,535
Is it okay for the person who
will become Hokage

178
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,704
to lie to everyone, I wonder...?

179
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,708
Go outside, brat!

180
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,969
It's just like before...

181
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,153
Despite how I look,
I'm going to be the Fifth Hokage.

182
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,324
I shouldn't take
this short brat of a foe seriously...

183
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,578
This one is enough...

184
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,540
Don't call me brat!

185
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,710
I may be like this now,
but I'll be Hokage some day!

186
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,899
Here I go!

187
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,035
Another brow flick?!

188
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,395
Become a fine man...

189
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,400
and, a fine Hokage.

190
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,365
Yeah!

191
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,798
Okay! Shall we go home?
To our hometown the Leaf Village!

192
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,927
What? I haven't eaten yet...!

193
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,097
Don't try to distract me by laughing!

194
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,662
Nawaki... Dan...

195
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,504
the boy who will inherit your dreams,
my beloved ones,

196
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,841
is right here!

197
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,144
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

198
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

199
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:19,862
On your still shoulder

200
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,575
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

201
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

202
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

203
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,841
"Each one of us

204
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,554
glows differently,"

205
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,851
you say laughingly

206
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,562
but you look most dazzling

207
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,067
Like a comet,

208
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:04,240
like the rainbow after the storm

209
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,870
You bring light

210
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,372
into my heart

211
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost can be the answer

212
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:22,508
Let's promise we won't cheat

213
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:28,347
Uh...like a shooting star,

214
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,726
we do go ahead.

215
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,319
Yahoo! Here we are at a hot spring spot!

216
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,615
While Pervy Sage is gawking at women,
and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,

217
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,035
I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!

218
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,205
What?! Who worked over my room?!

219
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,207
I don't know who they are,

220
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,921
but I'm gonna find them
and kick their butts!

221
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:04,050
Next time: "Kidnapped!
Naruto's Hot Spring Adventure!"
