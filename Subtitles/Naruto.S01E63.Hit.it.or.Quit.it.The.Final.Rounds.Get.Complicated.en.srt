1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,270
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,961
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,312
Hit it or Quit it:
The Final Rounds Get Complicated!

24
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,827
You...
You did it!

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,626
So that fox kid can fight like this...

26
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,638
That was awesome!

27
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,306
Well done!

28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,975
That was a great fight!

29
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,280
Yay!

30
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,702
And he still has the energy
to run around...

31
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,205
Man... He's got crazy stamina that guy...

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,333
That Naruto...

33
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,002
He keeps getting stronger...

34
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,421
He did it...that kid.

35
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,756
Yeah! He's on the right track!

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,009
And he's a little cute...

37
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,430
Something about it...

38
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,723
I'm envious of you...

39
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:06,270
Watching your battle makes me think
that I have to work really hard too...

40
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,272
That's amazing, you know?

41
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,487
He won.

42
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,740
Is it for real?

43
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,911
I thought he was the same as me,
in the not going anywhere class...

44
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,579
Not going anywhere?

45
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,081
Now people are squealing...

46
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,042
Looks like he's part of the group
that's going somewhere.

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,753
Maybe I couldn't beat him...

48
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:34,590
This is really bad.
It kinda depresses me...

49
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,761
To retain himself and draw out
the Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox...

50
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:43,223
Yeah... Most of the Leaf Village people
here are surprised.

51
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,559
That Naruto...

52
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:50,272
When did he learn to control the strength
of Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,281
Even a bird who gets caught,
once it learns how,

54
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:03,160
will open the lid of its basket
with its own beak.

55
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:12,086
He won't give up, for he wants to
fly freely in the sky again.

56
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,430
This time you lost!

57
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,774
Father...

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,988
It's okay, there's no damage
to his internal organs.

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,074
It seems like his Chakra
is almost used up.

60
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,788
You are not the only one special.

61
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,166
Why do you act against
your fate that much?!

62
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,921
Because I was called a failure...

63
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,925
Those who become Hokage
are born to that fate.

64
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,303
So what?!

65
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,226
Lord Hyuga!

66
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:14,773
I'm sorry but...
Could you step out for a moment?

67
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,526
B-But...

68
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,861
It won't take long.

69
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,821
Y-Yes.

70
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,417
What do you need from me?

71
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,461
That day...

72
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,674
I came to tell you the truth...
about that day.

73
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,010
That day...?

74
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,334
At that time, I intended to die!

75
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,881
W-What are you talking about?!

76
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,508
That day my father...

77
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,010
He was killed
as your body double!

78
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,773
The truth of that day...is here.

79
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:44,321
They're probably only excuses made
at the convenience of the head family.

80
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,992
The person you are now...
should be able to understand.

81
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,251
This writing...!

82
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,925
Neji...

83
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,720
I only have a little time left.

84
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,434
I want to use that limited time
to convey something to you...

85
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,311
Convey something to me?

86
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,358
The head of Ninjas from the
Land of Lightning,

87
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,652
who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,

88
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,238
was killed by Lord Hiashi...

89
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,490
But the Land of Lightning

90
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,993
didn't
acknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,

91
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,371
made only the killing
of the head Ninja a problem,

92
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,999
and made unreasonable demands.

93
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,086
It can't be helped.

94
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,006
With my one life,
the village can be saved...

95
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,845
Wait, Hiashi. Don't be so hasty!

96
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,473
The Hyuga's Kekkei Genkai

97
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,393
is an important strength of this land.

98
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:01,023
It is the duty of the head family
to protect it forever...

99
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,942
However, for the sake of that duty...

100
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,362
if we involve our land
in a desperate war...!

101
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,866
I understand that!
That's why...

102
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,537
Isn't that why
we have branch families?

103
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,540
Hizashi's corpse...

104
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,043
We'll hand it over as your body double.

105
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,715
Hizashi too...
understands the situation.

106
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,805
However,

107
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,851
what they want is
the secret of the power of the Byakugan.

108
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,313
The point in time that
Hizashi becomes a corpse,

109
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,107
that power will be sealed.

110
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,402
I don't believe that the Land of Lightning
will consent to that.

111
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,740
That's their true intent,

112
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,534
but the condition made by Lightning

113
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,413
is to
"Hand over Hiashi Hyuga's dead body."

114
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,791
We pretend that we agreed
to their terms,

115
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,211
and hand Hizashi,
who is identical to you, over...

116
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,547
and they can't pursue it
any further than that.

117
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,008
B-But...

118
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,471
Hiashi...

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,432
The time has come...

120
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,478
Your predecessors have done the same
to protect the power of Hyuga clan.

121
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:27,109
Even siblings...
have the heart to write each other off.

122
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:34,074
That is the fate of the head family.

123
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,450
And this...

124
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,663
is the destiny of
ones born into Hyuga!

125
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,960
Where has Lord Hiashi,
who is always bullish, go?

126
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,755
The scale of this issue is different
from the ones in the past!

127
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,299
It's not that easy...

128
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,646
H-Hizashi...you...

129
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,607
Please...let me go.

130
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,905
You... You...

131
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,408
have Neji.

132
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,996
Why do you choose death...
for the head family?!

133
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,789
That's not so!

134
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,045
I have been resenting
the head family.

135
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,506
To tell the truth
even now I'm bitter.

136
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,924
That's why...

137
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,303
I want to die protecting you

138
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,766
as "my brother," not as the head family.

139
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,143
It's the first time

140
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,773
I've had
the freedom to choose.

141
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,403
I've only shown Neji my ugly side.

142
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,490
However, now I've come here

143
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,034
and finally know my own intentions.

144
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,122
So please tell Neji...

145
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,169
I-I wasn't killed to protect
the head family...

146
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,672
but to protect my siblings,

147
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,883
family and the land...

148
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,803
by my own will I chose death!

149
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,479
T-To choose death...

150
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,565
you call that freedom...?

151
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,610
Big brother...

152
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,780
Once, just this once,

153
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,825
I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.

154
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,412
I wanted to choose my own fate.

155
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,164
That's all.

156
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,422
Overcome your own fate, Neji...

157
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,510
Fate is something you work out
with your own hands.

158
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,554
Father...

159
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,600
This is...the truth!

160
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,771
I'm sorry!

161
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,031
Please...

162
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,284
raise your head.

163
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,380
Father...

164
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:40,010
I wonder if a person's destiny is
only floating like a cloud

165
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,262
in a fixed current...

166
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,559
Or is a person able to ride
on the current that he chooses.

167
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,686
I don't understand it well yet.

168
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:54,065
Whichever, the end point
might still be the same...

169
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,319
Just, when the choice is the latter...

170
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,030
people turn toward the goal of
living and work hard toward it.

171
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,783
And those who hold that
are really strong.

172
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,953
I feel like I finally understand,
through this battle...

173
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,790
And... father...

174
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,793
I have only one goal...

175
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,632
I want to become stronger,
so I won't lose to anyone.

176
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,928
That's how I feel now.

177
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,766
Father...I see many birds flying.

178
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,393
And they seem to be enjoying themselves.

179
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,364
It's buzzing.

180
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,783
That's because it was a good battle...

181
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,370
Certainly, there's that too, but...

182
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,957
It's likely that,

183
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,586
for the curious heads
of Ninja and the feudal lords,

184
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,589
there is no match they look forward to
more than this next match.

185
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,135
By the way,

186
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,264
it seems that
he wasn't seen at the opening ceremony...

187
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,267
He's arrived here already, hasn't he?

188
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,148
There's been no news of Sasuke.

189
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,359
And there's the issue of Orochimaru.

190
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,404
Before everyone starts to make noise,
we should disqualify him...

191
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,078
What's going on?!
Hurry up and start the next match!

192
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,955
How long are you going to
make us wait!

193
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,790
Before night falls!

194
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,628
I wonder what's going on
with the next match?

195
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,589
Is Sasuke here?

196
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,300
Sasuke...

197
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,887
That guy...
What in the world is he doing?!

198
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,639
Is he planning
not to show up?

199
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,393
A wise man never courts danger...

200
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,520
A wise judgement...is it?

201
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,360
What are you saying?

202
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,364
He'll definitely come! Believe it!

203
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,672
But seriously, what is he doing?

204
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,842
Keep this up and he...
he'll be disqualified.

205
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,553
There's no choice...

206
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,725
Sasuke is...disqualified.

207
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:34,934
Yes.

208
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,729
Sasuke Uchiha is...disqualified?

209
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,441
It has to be done.

210
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,070
What in the world are
we going to do?

211
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,989
If that guy doesn't show up,
our plan of strategy...

212
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,741
This isn't good...

213
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,205
Could he have...?

214
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,042
Where are you going, Gaara?

215
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,213
I'm going to confirm my existence...

216
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,216
Darn that Gaara...

217
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,843
I wonder if he really killed him...

218
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,189
Sasuke one more time...

219
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,610
What happened?

220
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,489
It's obvious that you're there
standing with the thirst for blood.

221
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,324
Why don't you come out?

222
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,915
It's you...

223
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,717
Lord Hokage...

224
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,470
I want you to consider waiting a little bit
for Sasuke Uchiha's disqualification.

225
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,932
I understand your point, but...

226
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,060
No matter how excellent the Shinobi,

227
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,730
to make light of time is not
a qualification for Chunin.

228
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,067
If there's no clear reason to satisfy
the heads of Ninja and feudal lords

229
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,944
who are here,

230
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,863
there's no reason to wait for him!

231
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,366
I see...

232
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,786
Well then, there is a sufficient reason.

233
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,373
Including myself...

234
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,585
most of the heads of Ninja and
feudal lords that are here...

235
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,213
came here because
they want to see the next match.

236
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,676
However...

237
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,388
He's the remaining survivor
of the "Uchiha."

238
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,643
Land of the Wind too, absolutely,
is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.

239
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,897
Lord Hokage...

240
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,817
There's no guarantee that
Sasuke will come but...

241
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,779
All right then...

242
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,575
We shall specially postpone
this match and wait.

243
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,580
Lord Hokage! Really...

244
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,999
Inform so to the Proctor!

245
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,418
Y-Yes.

246
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,006
However...

247
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,302
It's rare for you to insist like that,
Lord Kazekage.

248
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,054
Well...

249
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,724
To show off the Shinobi's qualities
of our village to the feudal lords...

250
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,310
there's no better opponent
than an Uchiha.

251
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,605
It's a chance for us as well.

252
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,108
C'mon, what happened to the match?!

253
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,277
What happened to Uchiha?!

254
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:33,947
I understand...

255
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,202
Everyone!

256
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,748
The candidate for the
next battle has not arrived here!

257
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,209
We'll briefly postpone this battle

258
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,462
and start the following battle ahead of it.

259
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,884
What is he doing...that Sasuke?

260
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,972
Great, so Sasuke didn't get disqualified!

261
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,145
That's good...

262
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,984
Hey! That means my match
is one match closer!

263
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,445
Then, on to the next pair!

264
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,782
Kankuro and Shino Aburame!
Come down!

265
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,204
My match...doesn't matter at all.

266
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,917
More importantly...

267
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:33,006
I'd rather not expose the Mechanism
of Crow to the enemy

268
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,257
before the plan...

269
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:37,969
Proctor!

270
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,596
I abstain!

271
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,973
What?!

272
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,102
I abstain!
Please advance the matches!

273
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,621
Due to Kankuro's abstention,
Shino Aburame wins by default!

274
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,373
- What's that all about?!
- Have a proper match!

275
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,433
-You are...?
-It's my turn, isn't it?

276
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,728
It seems that you're really fired up.

277
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,856
Okay, let's go to the next match.

278
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,943
Hey! The last one, come down!

279
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:39,113
Hey! Hey! What are you doing,
frivolously building things up?

280
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:44,911
I mean, why does only
my match have to be modified?

281
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,747
Shikamaru Nara! You!

282
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,084
Damn...
If it's like this I'll abstain too...

283
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,420
C'mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!

284
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,262
Damn that Naruto...

285
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,483
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

286
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,945
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

287
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,365
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

288
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,743
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

289
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:32,291
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

290
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:38,297
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

291
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,008
Fight! Fight! Fight!

292
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,229
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

293
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,649
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

294
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,069
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

295
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,614
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

296
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:09,912
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

297
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

298
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,170
Fight! Fight! Fight!

299
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:23,634
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

300
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:29,766
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

301
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,184
Fight! Fight! Fight!

302
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,108
Go! Shikamaru!

303
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,652
It looks a bit strange that Shikamaru
is fighting in the Final Round.

304
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,905
He's good, firing up, burning up!

305
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,865
That's my teammate!

306
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,950
But, doesn't he seem spaced out
looking at the sky?

307
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,328
He totally looks so ambitious.

308
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,996
All right, Shikamar!

309
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,208
Keep it up and
attack hard!

310
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,212
Nex time, "Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!"

311
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,006
Ino, your cheering is kinda scary.
