1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,920
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:44,230
Wow. There's a lot of new houses
being built around here.

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,857
I hear it's been a bit of
a construction boom recently.

18
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,943
Seems like a lot of the construction sites
are short-handed

19
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,112
and they're hiring carpenters
from people outside of the country, too.

20
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,824
Even I know that.

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,538
Oh, Old Man Genno!

22
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,457
Oh... Naruto.

23
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,792
Who is he?

24
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,545
He's a carpenter from the Land of Sand.

25
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,089
He likes ramen, and we bump
into each other at Ichiraku.

26
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,759
How about we go there after this?

27
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,512
Yeah!

28
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,224
Here you go,
thanks for waiting!

29
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,684
Thank you for this meal!

30
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,227
Thank you.

31
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,734
Ichiraku's ramen is the best, after all!

32
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,696
Isn't it so? Isn't it so?

33
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,031
I'm sorry, but can I have some water...?

34
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,157
Sure!

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,202
Thank you for this meal!
That was fast!

36
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,454
Are you full already?

37
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,124
No... Not really...

38
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,376
Then, I'll give you mine.

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,712
Lucky!

40
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,339
Hey, Naruto!

41
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,967
The two of them are always like this.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,053
They act as if they're really
grandfather and grandson.

43
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,181
Oh come on, Sakura,
stop being so harsh.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,352
There're lots of other people
who complain. Like Grandma Tsunade.

45
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,771
And there's Shino, Ino, Kiba,
and Kakashi Sensei...

46
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,607
But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura.

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,858
Come on, Naruto!

48
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,568
That's only because
you're always at fault!

49
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,697
Now, now, Sakura calm down.
You hair will turn gray... Ouch!

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,157
– Looks like it's time
– Just leave it and eat up already!

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,783
– I got to business...
– But I got nothing left!

52
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,078
– Hey, hey.
– Help me, Old Man Genno!

53
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,666
Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather

54
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,017
Damn!

55
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,812
What is it? Fog?

56
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,777
Well, I guess it doesn't matter...

57
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,252
Lady Tsunade.

58
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,172
I'm sorry to bother you
during your sleep,

59
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,967
but the man that the Anbu Black Ops
have had marked...

60
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,135
Has made his move?

61
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,429
He is currently on the run.

62
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,098
On the run?

63
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,183
Are you telling me even with
the array of the Anbu Black Ops,

64
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,018
we still can't catch him?

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,187
Who is he?

66
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,773
You must know his identity by now.

67
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,526
There was nobody in
the recent Bingo Book

68
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,987
that fit his description,

69
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,739
but when we checked
an older Bingo Book...

70
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,245
Genno?

71
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,622
Genno the Trapper?

72
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,957
You do know of him?

73
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,835
He should be quite old by now.

74
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,087
I hadn't heard his name in a while,

75
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,214
so I thought that
he had already retired, but...

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,970
I never would have thought that
he was infiltrating the Leaf Village.

77
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,686
I guess I can't fight against old age.

78
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:17,359
No... I guess I should say this is just
what I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.

79
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,953
We want hand over the thing you took
from the master carpenter' house.

80
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,915
You think I would still be holding
onto that thing?

81
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,461
I've had a long life as a Shinobi...

82
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,839
I guess it wouldn't be so bad to
close the curtain at this time.

83
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,300
Though I regret that
I won't be able to see

84
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,093
the end of the Leaf Village
with my own eyes!

85
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,263
Paper Bombs!
Retreat!

86
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,353
Are you saying that someone

87
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,023
is planning a huge attack
against the Leaf Village?!

88
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,860
That would be the only reason
anyone would want those plans

89
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,987
besides carpentry purposes.

90
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,699
Genno's last words suggest that as well.

91
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,161
It's going to take some time
to decypher those plans,

92
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,664
but it's too dangerous to depend on that.

93
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,416
The enemy may
attack us any minute.

94
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,630
Activate the S-Level Emergency
Security Alert!

95
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,217
Leave the least amount of
men necessary here,

96
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,303
and all other men are to secure
the border!

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,766
Attack anyone who tries to cross
the border!

98
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,727
Don't allow them to attack the village,
no matter what!

99
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,152
Such great weather!

100
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,570
Naruto!

101
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,530
Oh! Sakura!

102
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,742
That sound like a big pain in the ass.

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,456
I think you'll be able to do it.
That is why we left you in the village.

104
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,419
At the very least, is there any way
that we can get more people?

105
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,548
Under these circumstances,
we can't turn over more people to you.

106
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,384
They're the greatest line-up for you,
aren't they?

107
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,220
The greatest...huh?

108
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,478
Fog? Last night's weather didn't seem
like it was going to be foggy.

109
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,940
How strange...
Was it all a dream?

110
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,532
Doesn't it seem like
we're really low on people?

111
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,618
That's what I was thinking, too.

112
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,994
From the looks of it,

113
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,538
the village must be
under special security alert.

114
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,959
What?! For real?!
I didn't notice it!

115
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,754
You should notice these kinds of things.
You're a Ninja.

116
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,173
But if we're in a state of emergency,

117
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,633
it's a huge deal for the village,
isn't it?

118
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,552
Why haven't they told us anything?

119
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,889
That's why Lady Tsunade is calling us.

120
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,643
Come in.

121
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,063
Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.

122
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,484
Shikamaru...

123
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,946
So you must've been left out, too.

124
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,657
Huh? What are you taking about?

125
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,450
Nothing...

126
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,287
Oh, hey Shikamaru.
About last night's weird fog...

127
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,789
Did you see it?

128
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,375
Stop it.
You were just dreaming.

129
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,585
There was no fog.

130
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,170
See. I told you...

131
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,089
That was a smoke screen.

132
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,548
Smoke screen?

133
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,426
I'll explain once
everyone gets here.

134
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,137
– Huh?
– Naruto, Sakura...

135
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,597
The reason why we left you out of

136
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,058
the S-Level Emergency
Security Alert unit

137
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,935
is because we wanted you
to work under Shikamaru

138
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,395
for a special mission.

139
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,231
What?
Well, that's the case.

140
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,901
First, I want you to gather
the people I'm about to name.

141
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,466
Hey, calm down, Naruto!

142
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,177
But it's already past the time
we were supposed to gather!

143
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,597
Not quite. To be accurate,
we still have twenty more seconds.

144
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,061
Seems like he's here.

145
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,485
Oh? Everyone's already here?

146
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,488
No matter how you look at it,
you're the last one!

147
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,451
Everyone's here now.
Then let's begin.

148
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,536
I'm sure that
you all have already noticed.

149
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,665
The village is currently under
the S-Level Emergency Security Alert.

150
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,542
It all started when...

151
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,961
The smoke screen last night, right?

152
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,838
You guys noticed it?

153
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,214
Of course.

154
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,633
The bugs were being noisy...

155
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,219
Huh? I didn't notice it.

156
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,638
You're always so out of it!

157
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,350
SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI!
I didn't notice it either...

158
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,227
WORSE THAN NARUTO!!
Could it be then that
I'm worse than Naruto?

159
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,605
Worse than Naruto... Worse than
Naruto... Worse than Naruto...

160
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,775
So what was that?

161
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,069
It seemed like something involving
the Anbu Black Ops.

162
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,487
So I stayed put...

163
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,032
Yeah, that's correct.
The Anbu Black Ops were involved.

164
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,533
Just as I thought...

165
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,786
It was late last night.

166
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,498
A man that the Anbu Black Ops had
been marking for the past two weeks

167
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,001
had snuck into the home of
Leaf Village's top carpenter boss...

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,675
And he stole the plans of our village's
important facilities from the secret safe.

169
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,677
Plans...?

170
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,930
So what's so bad about that?

171
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,432
He just stole the plans
for the facilities, right?

172
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,435
Just stole? You're so...

173
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,021
Naruto...

174
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,650
For example, let's say the plans for
the fort that surrounds the village

175
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,235
fell into enemy hands...

176
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,073
By analyzing those plans in detail,

177
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,741
the enemy could figure out
the most efficient way

178
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,160
to break into the village.

179
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,290
Now let's say that there were
plans for Lady Tsunade's mansion.

180
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,417
If you were to examine those plans,

181
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,754
you could find out how
to get the Lady Tsunade's room.

182
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,799
And if the plans were to get
into the hands of an assassin...

183
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,719
That's really, really bad.

184
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,431
Last night's smoke screen was...

185
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,892
something that suspect spread
as he was running away.

186
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,227
I see...

187
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,022
In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him
in the Western Forest...

188
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,859
He killed himself before
they could get him to talk.

189
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,323
Unfortunately,
when he committed suicide,

190
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,201
he wasn't in possession
of the plans he had stolen.

191
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,247
If the plans have already fallen
into the hands of the enemy...

192
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,959
it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of
the Destruction of Leaf Village.

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,795
In order to prevent that from happening

194
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,132
The S-Level Emergency Security Alert
was deployed this morning.

195
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,177
So, what is the mission for those
of us who were left behind?

196
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,723
Find out the location of
the stolen plans and bring them back.

197
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,391
That's our mission.

198
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,269
It's like finding a needle in
a haystack.

199
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,313
We just need to investigate
the path he took

200
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,899
and people he was acquainted with.

201
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:59,196
It turns out that the guy was famous
for being a top-level trap technician.

202
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,866
It's a huge possibility that
he left traps where the plans are.

203
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,119
It's definitely plausible.

204
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,331
I understand.
We'll follow your instructions.

205
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,291
I'll do it.

206
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,212
Then let's start the investigation.

207
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,257
Turns out that the man
had snuck into the village

208
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,635
a few months ago and worked
as a carpenter.

209
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,516
Th-This guy...

210
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,895
His name is...Genno

211
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,066
You're kidding me.

212
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,953
There's no way! Old Man Genno loved
the ramen at Ichiraku!

213
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:52,666
He would never do anything that
would destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!

214
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,294
Listen... There's no way that a guy
who's sneaking in to an enemy village

215
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,047
would show his bad side.

216
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,676
He played the part of a good guy
to let people's guard down.

217
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,387
There is no way that anyone
who loves ramen could be a bad person!

218
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,974
No. That's not true Naruto.

219
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,811
Choji... You tell him.
Put some sense into this guy.

220
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,274
Anyone who loves Ichiraku's ramen
can't be a bad person!

221
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,483
Choji!

222
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,195
Gosh, I can't depend on anybody...

223
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,284
This is a list of the stolen plans.

224
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,038
I'm so embarrassed
we lost our important plans...

225
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,666
I can't show my face to Lady Tsunade.

226
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,130
Which construction jobs
were Genno involved with?

227
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,549
None of them.

228
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,552
But wasn't he working under you?

229
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,722
I don't allow outsiders to work
on any construction

230
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,057
that involves the safety of the village.

231
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,520
That old man only worked
on residential construction.

232
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,147
Which means...

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,026
There's little possibility that he
snuck some traps into the construction.

234
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,986
I think it's impossible.

235
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,197
We should check everything,
just in case...

236
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,949
I'm counting on you.

237
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,119
Lady Hinata, please take care of these.

238
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,496
Y-Yes!

239
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,707
I'll go too.

240
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,042
Me too.

241
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,424
I've mentioned it earlier,
but there is a possibility

242
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,761
the the plans haven't fallen into
the enemy's hands yet.

243
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,973
It's possible that he could have hidden it
while he was running away.

244
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:36,227
And it's our mission to find that.

245
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,479
Understood.

246
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,237
It's the start of a treasure hunt.
I'm depending on you Akamaru.

247
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,408
Go!

248
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,382
Ino and Sakura, you guys go
check the old man's body.

249
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,259
There might be some clues.

250
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,804
What?! Us?

251
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,430
I got it.

252
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,518
All right! You just want me to go right?!
I'll go!

253
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,981
Sakura, are you really okay with this?

254
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,151
I have to be. I'm training to become
a Medical Ninja.

255
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,487
I can't be afraid of something like this.

256
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,989
That might be the case for you, but...

257
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,578
Now...master carpenter.

258
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:41,418
Can you tell us everything you know
about Old Man Genno?

259
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,507
The old man came to Leaf Village
about three months ago...

260
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,761
He came to my place with
a recommendation letter

261
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,013
from a famous master carpenter
from the Land of Sand.

262
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,724
As you may already know,

263
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,227
there's a bit of a construction boom
in Leaf Village.

264
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,480
Every place is in need of more people.

265
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,816
And we needed more hands ourselves,

266
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,068
so we decided to hire him right away.

267
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,447
His carpeting skills...
were all right, just average.

268
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,616
I didn't feel the urge to
hire him permanently,

269
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,119
nor did I feel like I wanted to
fire him right away.

270
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,913
He took his job seriously.

271
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,584
He was perfect to hire
when we were short on people.

272
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,545
But after a while,

273
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:30,258
I found out that the recommendation letter
he brought was a fake.

274
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,261
This is the recommendation letter
he brought.

275
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,724
And how is this a fake?

276
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,728
There was a guy who brought
a recommendation letter

277
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,064
from the same master carpenter
more than ten years ago.

278
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,234
I just happen to find that
recommendation letter,

279
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,446
so I compared it and I noticed
that the handwriting was different...

280
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,407
And that recommendation letter?

281
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,576
It's over there in that cabinet...

282
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:04,209
Oh? Where did I put it?
I know I put it here...

283
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,085
It's okay if you don't have it.

284
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,712
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:13,718
For us, we really didn't care if
his recommendation letter was a fake

286
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,305
as long as he didn't do anything bad.

287
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:22,852
I just thought that I should let things
like this be known to Lady Tsunade...

288
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,481
I didn't think that
the old man was be

289
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,401
a Shinobi from another country
and that he would steal our plans...

290
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,447
I still can't believe it.

291
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,743
Hey, is it really that
old man's doing?

292
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,622
I can't believe it either.

293
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,003
There're no signs of traps...

294
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,844
All right.

295
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,308
This is where the old man lived, huh?

296
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,520
He always paid the rent on time.

297
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,107
He really was quite proper...

298
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,986
Once in a while he'd come home
after drinking with his carpenter friends,

299
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,738
but he would never cause trouble.

300
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:20,702
Well, I did predict it,
but there are no clues...

301
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,036
I found it!

302
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,621
What did you find?

303
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:28,459
A special bonito broth, refreshing udon
and light broth super thin udon!

304
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,379
We're not looking for food!

305
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,549
But usually if somebody
is living by himself,

306
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,302
he'd probably stack up
on a bit more food...

307
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,387
There's only instant cup-udon.

308
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:45,310
Didn't he eat out a lot?
I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot...

309
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,436
Right, Naruto?

310
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,187
Oh... Yeah.

311
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,066
If he cooked himself, he could have
eaten more and saved money...

312
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,611
Choji, we're not talking about you.

313
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,542
That old man
barely talked about himself...

314
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,002
Just as I expected.

315
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,546
Oh, but he did happily talk about

316
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,717
how he became friends
with one of the kids in the village.

317
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,721
He might have heard something
from the old man.

318
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,682
Oh, I wonder about that.

319
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,476
What you mean you wonder about that?

320
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,687
We won't know until we find the kid
and question him, won't we?

321
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:34,275
But it seems like there's no need for us
to look for him or question him.

322
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,320
What?! Then, where is this guy!

323
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,950
Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!

324
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,494
What?! Me?!

325
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,955
Yeah, there's no mistake about that.

326
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,498
You're Naruto Uzumaki?

327
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,958
Huh?

328
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,921
We want you to
talk with us for a bit.

329
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,039
On a checkerboard night

330
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,750
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

331
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,797
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

332
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,134
Suggestively

333
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,471
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

334
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:51,811
The Trombone gradually going off-key

335
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:56,065
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

336
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:03,072
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

337
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:08,661
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

338
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,359
I wonder what kind of interrogation
Naruto is undergoing?

339
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,071
I guess they would use
Regressive Hypnosis or something.

340
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,238
What's Regressive Hypnosis?

341
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:47,283
It's a Jutsu to draw out
subconscious memories.

342
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,163
Then Naruto might know something
even with his bad memory.

343
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,247
Hmm. I wonder about that.

344
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,709
Well, this Old Man Genno sounds
like he was pretty tricky...

345
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,753
Wait, why are you here anyway?

346
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,090
Next time: "The Anbu Gives Up?
Naruto's Recollection"
