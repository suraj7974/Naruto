1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,409
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,734
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,862
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,615
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,537
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:40,518
The Missed Target

17
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,646
Naruto, Choji, gather all of them!

18
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,815
I know!

19
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,650
Yeah!

20
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,029
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

21
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,824
Pick it up! Pick it up!

22
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,951
Over here!

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,786
Over there!

24
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,871
Don't lose any of them!

25
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,665
Yeah!

26
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,750
Pick it up!

27
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,585
Over there!

28
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,629
Go over there!

29
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,965
Hey that's mine!

30
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,425
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

31
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,844
Arm!

32
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,640
Where did that bird go?

33
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,814
Damn it! We lost it!

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,483
Over there!

35
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,488
Just a little more...

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,452
This is a mission believe it or not!

37
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,750
This is something very important...

38
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:51,297
I beg you...
Please let go of it!

39
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,260
We have trouble, Lady Tsunade!

40
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,595
What is it?!

41
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,305
Those papers
scattered throughout the village,

42
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,974
are the plans that were stolen
from the carpenter boss.

43
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,019
Currently, Shikamaru and his team
have finished collecting all the plans,

44
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,521
and rechecking them.

45
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,940
But it seems like they have
collected all of them.

46
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,817
What is the meaning of this?

47
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,152
I have no idea...

48
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,278
Lady Tsunade! We have a report

49
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,281
from those who headed to
the Hidden Waterfall Village!

50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,616
Was there movement!

51
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,954
Actually, it turns out that it was only
a large-scale practice run!

52
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,666
They are saying that they see
no signs of an invasion of Leaf Village.

53
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,918
What?!

54
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,586
It seems as though they have
already finished their practice run,

55
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,048
and the Hidden Waterfall Village
is back to normal.

56
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,426
So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Village
have nothing to do with each other...?

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,263
Disengage the S-Level
Emergency Security Alert!

58
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,557
Order all forces back to village!

59
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,184
Yes!

60
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,064
What in the world
was that man plotting?!

61
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,200
Lady Tsunade!

62
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,660
What now?!

63
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,789
The body that
the Anbu Black-Ops gathered...

64
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,165
It's...

65
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,627
It's not Genno...?

66
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,464
What does that mean?

67
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,801
But I thought that Old Man Genno was
cornered by the Anbu Black Ops

68
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,344
and blew himself up.

69
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:25,557
He traded places with a corpse that
he had ready right before the explosion...

70
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,018
That's a huge possibility!

71
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,270
We're in the middle of confirming that!

72
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,191
Their appearances look similar,
but small details bring up questions!

73
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,447
Most likely...it's another man.

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,701
Are you telling me
he fooled the Anbu Black Ops!

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,662
That means, Genno is...

76
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,623
He's still alive!

77
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,585
Damn! What is that man up to...?

78
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,311
Over there.
Behind that tree.

79
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,776
It's here!

80
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:26,201
I see... The Old Man Genno used
this hole to get away.

81
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,287
He camouflaged it well.

82
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,415
If it wasn't for the Byakugan,
we would have missed it.

83
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,209
Not only that...

84
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:38,088
This hole is made so that it closes
naturally by the weight of the earth.

85
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,299
If we came here another day later,

86
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,675
it would have been
extremely difficult to find,

87
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,094
even with the Byakugan.

88
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,472
And to prove that,

89
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,559
you can barely see any sign of
an entrance to this hole.

90
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,520
Akamaru, can you follow his scent?

91
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,112
He's even got getting rid of
his smell covered...

92
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,449
Where could he have gone?

93
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,000
Our conclusion is that...

94
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,087
Old Man Genno is still alive

95
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,464
and there's a possibility that
he's hiding in Leaf Village.

96
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,468
He got cornered,
and faked his own suicide,

97
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,054
and stole the plans so that he could...

98
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,100
make all of us turn our eyes outside
of the village.

99
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,728
He could have already known
about the big practice run

100
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,398
in the Hidden Waterfall Village
and used that to his advantage.

101
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:45,239
B-But the Anbu Black Ops
started to mark Genno because

102
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,451
they happened to find out that his letter
of recommendation was a fake, right?

103
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,120
Was it a coincident...?

104
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:56,583
Isn't it strange that
a real letter of recommendation was

105
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,587
at the house of the carpenter boss
he worked for?

106
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,591
Then what is his true goal?

107
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,679
If we knew the answer to that,
we wouldn't be struggling so much...

108
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,013
Shikamaru!

109
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,849
The only thing I can say now is...

110
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,854
The number of Shinobi in this village
currently is at its lowest ever.

111
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,400
We only have a bare minimum
of us here!

112
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,362
And most of their eyes are
looking outside of the village.

113
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:30,325
Even if Genno was walking around
as he was humming on the streets,

114
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,369
no one would suspect anything of him.

115
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,164
Did he set a trap in the village?!

116
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,958
Could the fact that that
he scattered the plans around mean that

117
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,294
he's already done setting his trap?

118
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:45,966
No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,095
We can't leave this place
without any security,

120
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,514
but we have few people...

121
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,434
Then where do we look?

122
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,352
The Academy.

123
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,979
The Academy?

124
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:03,025
Why the Academy out of all
the important facilities in the village?

125
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,277
Out of all the sites Genno worked on,

126
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,989
only the Academy's repair plan
was stolen.

127
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,367
It's hard to think that
it was a coincidence

128
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,994
for it to disappear at this timing.

129
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,003
Byakugan!

130
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,017
How is it?

131
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,479
There's nothing in this room.

132
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,899
Then...move ahead to the next room.

133
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,026
Byakugan!

134
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,077
Seems like there's nothing in this area

135
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,039
Can't you look at
the entire campus at once?

136
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,500
And we have Hinata too, you know?

137
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,628
That woul be possible
if we know what the target was,

138
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,339
but we're looking for
something suspicious.

139
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,591
We'll have to take the basic route.

140
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,720
Hey! Wait a minute!
You're in the way!

141
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,141
And there's too many... people here.

142
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,560
Like I said!

143
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,690
All I want is for you guys to come outside
even just for a moment!

144
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:29,903
Our teacher told us to study on our own
in the classroom for today!

145
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,407
We can't go out of the room!

146
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,827
There are no teachers today!

147
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,371
So nobody would know
if you left the class!

148
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,875
We used to skip class when
Iruka Sensei wasn't looking

149
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,420
when we were younger.

150
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,213
Oh! A delinquent!

151
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:52,801
– Delinquent
– Delinquent!

152
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,345
We have to check this area!

153
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,975
Besides, all the teachers have gone
on a mission to protect the village.

154
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,686
Why are you guys still here?

155
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
They must be useless.

156
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,942
What did you say?!
We're also protecting the village too...

157
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,778
Naruto. You're wasting time

158
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,488
Let's crush them!

159
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,823
What?

160
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,908
The Expansion Jutsu!

161
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,460
We're going to tell on you to our teacher!

162
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,753
Yeah, do as you please!

163
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,379
Idiot!

164
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,549
Let's practice our Kunai Knives.

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,633
Sounds good.

166
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,225
It doesn't seem like
there's anything suspicious...

167
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,400
Hurry up!
Wait!

168
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:59,326
Come on.
I'm begging you to leave!

169
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,827
Naruto!

170
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,792
Where did those kids from
the next classroom go?

171
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,585
I don't know...

172
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,253
They were going to practice
their Kunai Knives.

173
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,422
That's what they were saying.

174
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,259
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

175
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,222
They're practicing their Kunai Knives
in a place like that?

176
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
I'll do next.

177
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,937
Ok. Do your best!

178
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
Do it!
Yeah!

179
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,442
Oh, so close.

180
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,409
They really are practicing...

181
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,328
When we were
students at the Academy,

182
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,914
we used to skip class and come here.

183
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:53,004
The teacher's couldn't find us here,
it really was great!

184
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,550
I read comic books, and took naps...

185
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,261
That's right, I ate potato chips.

186
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,096
Well, that's no good!

187
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,348
You can learn something from those kids.

188
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,934
Even if the teachers doesn't see you,

189
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,311
you should still commit to your practice!

190
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,939
They're true models of students!

191
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,027
Wonderful!
I'm excited! I'm moved!

192
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,281
I'd like to take class with them!

193
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,034
We wouldn't want to interrupt.
Let's go.

194
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,078
Yeah...

195
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,204
Naruto...

196
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,539
What?

197
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,916
Did they have that before?

198
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,179
I'm going to get this one!

199
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,143
Ouch!

200
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,606
I had it!

201
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,609
It seems pretty new.

202
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,069
Genno could have made it...

203
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,325
I-I'm going to get Neji or Hinata!

204
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,828
You guys get out of the way.

205
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,831
You're getting in the way of our practice.

206
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,750
O-Oh I'm sorry!

207
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,127
I'm next!

208
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,005
Byakugan!

209
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,182
It's a Paper Bomb!
It's hidden behind the wall!

210
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,434
What, inside the wall?!

211
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,395
It's completely hidden inside the wall.

212
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,942
But then how do you
detonate it...?

213
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,486
Oh, there she is.

214
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,697
Hey! Hinata!

215
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,866
Naruto.

216
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,159
Naruto...

217
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,871
Hinata, go out with me!

218
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,835
Wh-What are you saying
at a time like this?!

219
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,212
Huh?

220
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:03,176
I-I don't know... Go out with you?

221
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,011
You won't?

222
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,515
I-I'm not necessarily saying no...

223
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,148
Then I'll just ask Neji then.
See you later!

224
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,650
What?

225
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,908
There's a thin thread attached
to the Paper Bomb.

226
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,076
A thread?

227
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,705
It's probably a special thread
used to ignite it.

228
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,250
He's probably is going to detonate it
from a distance...

229
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,378
Where is that thread connected to?!

230
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,058
It goes around the classroom and...

231
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,147
It goes outside...
towards the training hall...?

232
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,859
There's a log standing...

233
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,989
This... Could it be?!

234
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,745
Neji! Come with me for a second!

235
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,414
What is it!
We're in the middle of something...

236
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,792
Actually there's a strange log standing
in the training hall over there.

237
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,544
We wanted him to check it.

238
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,464
That's the triggering device!

239
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,965
Huh?

240
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,929
Try loosening up your shoulders
and then throw it.

241
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,681
Shut up.

242
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,392
All right, I'm up next.

243
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,355
There should be a target on the log.

244
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,564
Yeah, there is.

245
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,317
The center of the target
is the triggering device!

246
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,322
When a Kunai Knife hits the center...

247
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,282
the device will activate...

248
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,326
And the Academy will explode!

249
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,329
So close!

250
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,415
If you focus, you'll hit the target.

251
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,419
All right, I'm going to hit this time.

252
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,508
Focus...

253
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,759
And target!

254
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,470
Don't let anybody hit the target!

255
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,485
All right, I hit the target!

256
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,363
You did it!

257
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,366
Oh?

258
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,412
The tip is cracked.

259
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:40,417
You always have to take care of your tools.

260
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,545
Damn, I thought that I hit the target.

261
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,506
This way! Behind there!

262
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,719
All right...
I'm going to hit it for sure!

263
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,637
That's the spirit!

264
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,183
This looks good!

265
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,394
This time I'm going to hit it!

266
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,229
Bushy Brow!

267
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,814
Stop it, Lee!

268
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,735
What?

269
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,242
Oh, did I scare you?

270
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,413
I'm sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tool...
Here.

271
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,590
Bushy Brow, you did it!

272
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,176
I had the target!

273
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,178
Why did you get in the way?!

274
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,930
Be quiet!
If that had hit the target,

275
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,724
the Academy would have exploded!

276
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,142
What...?

277
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,935
For real?

278
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,237
A triggering device in here...huh?

279
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,408
When something hits the center,
the Academy explodes.

280
00:17:55,825 --> 00:18:00,079
So there hasn't been anyone
who's been able to hit the center.

281
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,415
We really were lucky.

282
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,168
We were lucky, huh?

283
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:11,382
So who started to practice
throwing their Kunai-Knife here?

284
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,594
Who? Who was it?

285
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,346
Somebody told us that we'd be praised

286
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,973
if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwing
in secret from the teachers.

287
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,643
"in secret from from the teachers..."

288
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:27,440
Whoever must've used Genjutsu
to make them think that.

289
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,484
It must be Genno.

290
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,575
What happened?

291
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:44,916
There's more than one thread
coming out of the triggering device.

292
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,419
Is that true Hinata?
Yeah...

293
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,466
Byakugan!

294
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,764
True.
There's not just one

295
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,811
...two...no, three?

296
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,855
Where are they connected to?

297
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,776
Outside of the academy...
No!

298
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,279
Wait! It's hard to see from here.

299
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,741
M-Me too...

300
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,891
Byakugan!

301
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,100
Byakugan!

302
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,365
I found one.

303
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,539
I found one, too

304
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,333
Tell us the location.

305
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,878
No, wait.
The thread splits again.

306
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,634
Over here too...

307
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,981
Th-This is...

308
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,442
No...way...

309
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,361
It can't be...

310
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,739
Hey! What's the matter!

311
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,952
There's Paper Bombs planted
all over the village!

312
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,996
It's not just 10 or 20...

313
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,209
It's countless numbers of them!

314
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,710
What?!

315
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,132
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is a nest of Paper Bombs!

316
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,164
On a checkerboard night

317
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,875
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

318
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,922
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

319
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,259
Suggestively

320
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:45,638
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

321
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:51,936
The Trombone gradually going off-key

322
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,190
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

323
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:03,197
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

324
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:09,829
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

325
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,859
– Now, the Academy is safe.
– All right!

326
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,694
It's too early to feel relieved.

327
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,446
If he realizes the Paper Bombs
are being deactivated,

328
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,907
