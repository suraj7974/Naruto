1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,047
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,733
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,931
...bring it to an end swiftly!

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,100
I won't let you do anything.

20
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,602
First move, a surefire victory!

21
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,869
Wow! That's amazing!

22
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,996
What's with his body?!

23
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,208
I dislocate every joint

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,462
and with Chakra, I can control
my softened body at will.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,673
With Chakra...?

26
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,721
I can also squeeze until
your bones break.

27
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,600
I'll rapidly tighten as long
as you don't give up.

28
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,396
I don't know what kind of
ninja tool you'll use...

29
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,524
but if I keep doing this to your body,
it will make no difference.

30
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,361
I can break your neck right now.

31
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,322
So hurry up and give up.

32
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,325
No.

33
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,827
Do you want to die?!

34
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:45,249
Idiot. You're the one who's
going to die.

35
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,179
His neck is broken.

36
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,389
What?

37
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,683
How ridiculous...

38
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,144
Phew...

39
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,730
Idiot.

40
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,983
I went a little overboard and
ended up killing you.

41
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,574
W-What?

42
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,827
Okay, now it's my turn.

43
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,172
T-This is a Puppet!

44
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,390
T-That's the real body?

45
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,769
He's...a Puppet Master...

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,732
He's controlling the puppet with
Chakra from his hand!

47
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,870
G-Give up...!

48
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,584
If your bones get crushed,
you'll be able to bend even more, huh?

49
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:18,842
For once, I was close to stopping
the match in the middle.

50
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,724
The winner, by an inability
to continue the match by the opponent,

51
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:26,809
is Kankuro.

52
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,020
Two against one is hitting
below the belt!

53
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,399
Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!

54
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,442
It's not particularly hitting
below the belt.

55
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,277
It's a puppet, after all.

56
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,322
That's the Puppet Master Jutsu.

57
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,658
He's controlling the puppet with Chakra.

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,369
It's the same as using
a ninja tool... like shuriken.

59
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,293
They're all great Chakra users...

60
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,090
I thought I could make it
kind of far with Chakra.

61
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:04,930
Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious!

62
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,611
Ino...!

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,866
You've got the jitters,
don't you, Sakura?

64
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:24,950
Wha...?!

65
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,624
Even Sasuke collapsed.

66
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,670
I mean, it felt like it was because
it was Sasuke that it ended at that.

67
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,965
What'll happen if you take part?

68
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,427
It might be best if you quit!

69
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,104
Something like that
won't work on me!

70
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,116
It's okay! I can tough it out
this time around, too.

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,369
Quit? Who?

72
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,297
I can hardly wait.

73
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,059
Cha! Bring it on!

74
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,274
Now then, to continue,
we will begin the fourth battle.

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,698
Man, man, nothing but
weirdoes all over the place!

76
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,367
Don't you say that!

77
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,744
-You've got a point.
-You, too, Sakura?!

78
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,916
This isn't the time to be laughing.

79
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,711
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka

80
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:32,035
I never thought...
I'd be fighting you, Sakura.

81
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,496
And what's more, so soon.

82
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,587
Ino was a standout
among the rookie Kunoichi.

83
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,881
With Sakura as her opponent,

84
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,718
will she go...no,
can she go with serious intent?

85
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,929
To think it would be those
two of all people.

86
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,765
Things have gotten gloomy.

87
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,018
I wonder if Ino'll be okay.

88
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,312
That's for sure.

89
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,815
What're you going to do, Ino?

90
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,862
Sakura! Good luck! Don't lose!

91
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,115
Begin!

92
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,798
Oh, no. I knew it.

93
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,302
Sakura's totally blowing Ino away!

94
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,428
Idiot.

95
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,472
Say what?!

96
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,351
If you're not an idiot,
you must be sleeping, aren't you?

97
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,727
Who...?!

98
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,687
Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.

99
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,606
So this is their level of
hand-to-hand combat?

100
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,690
What?!

101
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,402
-It's not because they're Kunoichi.
-Huh?

102
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:52,783
It's just that those two are lukewarm.
There's no man or woman in battle.

103
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,122
Lukewarm...?

104
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,016
There!

105
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,891
Kunoichi must learn
not only Ninjutsu...

106
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:04,604
but also a wide range of
knowledge and refinement as women.

107
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:09,609
If you don't blend into enemy territory
and conduct yourselves as a normal woman...

108
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,572
you'll have it rough on occasions
such as when you work as spies.

109
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,491
Today's class is flower arranging.

110
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,161
Now then, everyone.

111
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,621
Let's gather flowers we like.

112
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,290
Yes, ma'am!

113
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,252
Ino, wait up!

114
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,635
You're such a klutz.

115
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,524
I'm...not good at stuff like this.

116
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,360
What about you, Ino?

117
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,073
That's no good, considering
your name's Sakura.

118
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,576
Listen. There are tricks
to things like this.

119
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,996
You know, as for flower arranging,

120
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,627
after you've decided on a main flower,
you add other flowers to decorate.

121
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,838
All flowers can't be
asserting themselves.

122
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,424
For example...look.

123
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,387
You can see those cosmos
flowers over there, right...?

124
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,224
For example, if they were
the main flowers...

125
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,519
the thoroughwort flowers
you picked are throw-ins!

126
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,314
As contrasted with
spring cherry blossoms,

127
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,525
cosmos flowers have the
name of autumn cherry blossom

128
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,653
and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.

129
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,031
Also, they're flowers with
the original meaning of "harmony,"

130
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,700
so any autumn grass would
go perfectly with them.

131
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,673
So? Do I look as nice
as the cosmos flowers?

132
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,133
Say, say, am I cute?

133
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,555
Uh...yeah.

134
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,932
Say. What's with the pause?

135
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,520
You look like you're having
so much fun.

136
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,064
Billboard Brow!

137
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,783
You've recently reached
adolescence, haven't you?

138
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,911
Don't get too full of yourself!

139
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,208
Ami!

140
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,963
Sorry! You have such
a beautiful cylinder-shaped body

141
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,674
I mistook you for a vase
and put flowers in you.

142
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,260
Ino!

143
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,804
Shinobi flower aconite.

144
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:48,143
It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,
so you'd best spit them out.

145
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,483
Sensei!

146
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,530
Only the root is poisonous, though.

147
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,953
Ino is great.

148
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,166
She knows everything,
is stylish, and is cute.

149
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,835
Even that shuriken skill.

150
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,879
Her Ninjutsu is great, too...

151
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,841
Compared to that, I...

152
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,555
Sakura?

153
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,142
If you're a cosmos flower...

154
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,521
then am I a thoroughwort?

155
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,654
What're you saying?!

156
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,072
What?

157
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,241
Let me see...

158
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:49,496
In a manner of speaking,
you are not a flower, but still a bud!

159
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,793
You're right.

160
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,144
At this point in time...

161
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,024
I don't even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.

162
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,026
What did you say?

163
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,907
You and Sasuke don't go together,
and I'm totally stronger than you!

164
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,576
You are beneath my notice!

165
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:33,373
Sakura! Do you know who
you're lipping off to?!

166
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,209
Don't press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
169.0101:14:49:1101:14:50:24I feel like...

167
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,883
I feel like Sakura
was out of line!

168
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,262
Ino's eyes show incredible anger.
She's scary.

169
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,432
Hmm. That's not it...

170
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,725
Huh?

171
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,853
Sakura's not the kind of
kid to do things

172
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,188
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.

173
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,152
She doesn't like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.

174
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,822
I'm a bud, huh...?

175
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,037
Say, Ino...

176
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,415
What?

177
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,379
Why...did you give this ribbon to me?

178
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,343
Actually...

179
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:33,683
I thought it'd be a waste for
you to wilt away as a bud.

180
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,776
There's no point if flowers don't bloom.

181
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,455
For all we know...
it just might...

182
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,302
become a flower
more beautiful than a cosmos.

183
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,981
Thank you...

184
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,151
Ino!

185
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,199
Okay Sakura.
Let's hurry and go pick flowers.

186
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,617
O-Okay.

187
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,078
What's wrong, Sakura?

188
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,207
I got some dirt in
my eye when I fell...

189
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,626
You're so clumsy.

190
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,965
Ino...

191
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:55,974
All along, I believed in the
words you gave me then.

192
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,476
I really thought that it would
be nice if it were so.

193
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,939
It would be nice if I could get
a beautiful flower to bloom...

194
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:10,447
I set my sights on you because
I wanted to be like you all along.

195
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,703
Thanks to that, I'm here now.

196
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,915
So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.

197
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:32,969
If I can't surpass you at your
most serious, there's no point.

198
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,708
W-What's with Sakura?

199
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,210
Hmm.

200
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,755
Why are those two getting that heated?!

201
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:16,346
Alas, he doesn't even understand
the reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.

202
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:21,476
Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,
is the point.

203
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,229
Huh?

204
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,191
Oh, hi...

205
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,737
My rival from youth, Kakashi...

206
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,951
Oh, how hip and galling that
nonsensical reaction is.

207
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,455
I...

208
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,709
got on the same team as Sasuke.

209
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,878
Why are you telling me now...?

210
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,133
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino.

211
00:18:54,884 --> 00:19:00,390
No matter what happens,
I won't lose to you either, Sakura!

212
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,939
The ribbon...

213
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,567
I'm giving back the ribbon.

214
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,995
I gave you that ribbon.

215
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,665
Besides, a headband is something
you put on your head, right?

216
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:31,212
From here on, I'm no longer
a girl who will run after you, Ino.

217
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,549
When I put this on my head,

218
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:39,178
it will be as a female Shinobi
who can't lose to you.

219
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,817
That's a good idea...

220
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,785
Me, too...

221
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,371
until that time.

222
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,379
I understand...Sakura.

223
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,816
– This time for sure...
– This time for sure...

224
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,819
– with full strength...
– with full strength...

225
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,909
– a fair...fight!
– a fair...fight!

226
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,353
Hey, can you hear it?

227
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:17,443
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

228
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:26,619
The ocean spans limitlessly

229
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:35,753
Please keep that smile on your face forever

230
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,344
Or else I'll cry

231
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:47,056
You won't have to search around you

232
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,269
It's all ok now.

233
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is inside

234
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,111
this hand

235
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:05,241
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

236
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,829
When you forget what happiness is

237
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

238
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,963
Light is born, and darkness was born

239
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

240
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,097
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

241
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,227
Hey, can you hear it?

242
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,650
Since when did she get this strong?!

243
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,569
Sure enough, Ino's great.

244
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,198
But I won't lose.
I absolutely will not lose.

245
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,034
It can't be. She's evenly
matched with me now?!

246
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,870
I'm not who I used to be.

247
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,791
– The next hit is the decisive blow!
– The next hit is the decisive blow!

248
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,170
Next episode:
"The Ultimate Battle: Cha!"

249
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,173
I cannot concede this battle,
even if it's the last thing I do!
