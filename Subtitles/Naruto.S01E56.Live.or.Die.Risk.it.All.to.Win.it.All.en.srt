1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,346
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,226
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,353
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,776
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,492
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,912
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,750
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,336
I wake up

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,301
and someday,

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,021
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:09,028
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

17
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
your uniqueness into strength

19
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,915
Even if you get lost,

20
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

21
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,255
One more time

22
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,033
Summoning Jutsu!

23
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,995
This time for sure, the frog will...

24
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,552
What's a frog anyway?!

25
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,846
From which stage do you call it a frog?!

26
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,521
Live or Die: Risk it All to Win it All!

27
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,822
Hey! Hold up a hope
on me a bit, would you?!

28
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,916
Whew... he collapsed again...

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,085
That's no surprise...

30
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:53,883
For three weeks, he's continued
his training on guts alone...

31
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,035
Lord Hokage.

32
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,455
Anko, is it...?

33
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,048
I'm sorry, I'm...

34
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:38,385
Regretting returning alive
from the Forest of Death?

35
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:47,853
That's a needless thing because you and
Orochimaru have no connection at all.

36
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:58,530
There is no Shinobi who can compete
against that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.

37
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:06,455
Even if I was the one to face him...

38
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,918
If the Fourth Hokage were still alive...

39
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,420
Don't say that.

40
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:17,925
He already saved this village and died...

41
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:23,889
That's a story from 13 years ago.

42
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,266
He's no longer here.

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,353
We have to do something with our power.

44
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,314
Yes.

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,153
I'm going to get some fesh air...

46
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,414
Don't blame yourself.

47
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,219
C'mon, open your eyes already.

48
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,683
W-What's that...?

49
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,395
To be clear, you have no sense.

50
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,897
Oh! Pervy Sage!

51
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,483
After you've been training for 3 weeks,
you are still this level.

52
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,069
If you continue like this it's pointless.

53
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:23,115
That's not how it is!
I'm doing this with all my might!

54
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:28,245
I understand that, if you really want
to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,

55
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,081
you have to do it like you're going
to die or it's no good at all.

56
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,833
That's what I'm doing!

57
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,169
I drill my Chakra every day
like I'm going to die.

58
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,297
If you have time to complain about it,
teach me a trick or something!

59
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,759
A trick, huh... A trick.

60
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,969
What?! You're going to teach me?

61
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,389
You need to risk your life on it.

62
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,974
L-Life...?

63
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,686
It's not a joke. Even so, will you do it?

64
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,524
O-Of course! I always risk my life!

65
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,818
I see...

66
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,903
Huh...?

67
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,072
Well then, follow me.

68
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,254
What are we doing at a place like this?

69
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,965
You're not gonna peek again, are you?

70
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,223
Well, that would be nice,
but today it's a bath.

71
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,891
First, we purify our bodies...

72
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,602
Huh?

73
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,488
There's something strange going on...

74
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:51,078
This is such a nice bath.

75
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:56,166
Like heaven... Truly heavenly...

76
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,338
Hey, Pervy Sage.

77
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm Toad Sage.

78
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:08,137
Whatever, but how are taking
a bath and Summoning related?

79
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey...!

80
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,187
What is it?!

81
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,565
-Hey, Naruto.
-Huh?

82
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
Is there something you want to eat?

83
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,992
I'm going to eat!

84
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,498
It's good! If the training is like this,
I'll do it every day!

85
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:40,252
Eat up! Because this is the last...

86
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,837
Huh?

87
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,382
No, nothing. Anyway, eat! Eat a lot!

88
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,968
Like there's no looking back!

89
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,933
I don't know what's going on,
but I should eat, right? Okay!

90
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,568
Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!

91
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,028
Gotcha!

92
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,365
One more!

93
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,450
Coming right up!

94
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,035
This time miso char siu!

95
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,494
Yeah!

96
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,332
I ate, I ate.

97
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,167
Thank you, Pervy Sage...

98
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,880
What?!

99
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,048
Thanks for your patronage!

100
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,557
I won't even get blood from it...

101
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,228
Yo, are you full?

102
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,481
Don't mess with me, Pervy Sage!

103
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,943
Weren't you treating me with the meal!

104
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,196
Fool! Who said that I was treating you?!

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,241
Aren't you a grown-up?! Bastard!

106
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,619
By the by, Naruto,
isn't there a girl that you like?

107
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,079
Huh?

108
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,999
I asked if you have a lovely girl?

109
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,169
Well...you could say she's there,
you could say I like her...

110
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,213
You could say it's Sakura.

111
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,297
So there is?

112
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,007
It's Sakura!

113
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:14,096
Okay! Then go and hug that girl tight!

114
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,432
What?!

115
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,850
Is that a part of the training?

116
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,395
Well, close enough.

117
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,231
Okay! Right away...

118
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,193
But if I do that, Sakura will...

119
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:33,740
No! This is training too!
I have to do it or I won't be strong...

120
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,868
But if I do that, Sakura will...

121
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,579
For a while she won't talk to me...

122
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,457
No! If I'm going to master
Summoning Jutsu,

123
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,251
this can't be helped!

124
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,212
But...Sakura will...

125
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,215
No! But...

126
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,467
Hurry up and go!

127
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,391
What do you want?

128
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,352
No, uh...well...

129
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,396
If it's money you want,
I won't lend it to you.

130
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,815
I may not look it,
but I'm stingy with money.

131
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,359
No, that's not it...

132
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,028
Well...

133
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:16,825
Uh, if I tell her it's for my training,
she's sure to beat me.

134
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,702
If there's nothing you want,
then I 'll go home.

135
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,537
W-Wait a minute!

136
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,497
Oh...

137
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,754
This is it! This is my chance!

138
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,422
Sakura! I'm sorry!

139
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,925
Hey!

140
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,510
What are you doing?!

141
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,392
Cha!

142
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,356
Ow... Ouch...

143
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,530
This is a part of being young...

144
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,662
Hey, if I do this I'll really get a frog?

145
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,916
Yes, that's a definite.

146
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,000
Really...?

147
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,753
Is there anything you've left undone?

148
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,837
Huh?

149
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,464
None?

150
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,424
What are you talking about...?

151
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,938
To pull out enormous Chakra and use it.

152
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,857
It is certain that it is difficult
to have the control to do it...

153
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,486
It is also certain that this body
is a vessel too small

154
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,780
to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra...

155
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,533
It's likely that Naruto's body normally
tends to reject

156
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,537
the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox
in order to avoid too much strain.

157
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,833
If the excitement of danger and
emotion are the key

158
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,585
to drawing out the
Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra...

159
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,464
he has to learn physically until
he can automatically use that key.

160
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,343
Nothing personal... Fourth Hokage!

161
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,279
Huh? Where...is this...?

162
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,531
Stand up!

163
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,409
W-What's going on?!

164
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,161
Your training ends here.

165
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,246
Huh? I haven't done anything yet...!

166
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,622
Naruto!

167
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,292
Go die and come back.

168
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,376
Die?

169
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,590
From within the dreadfulness of death,
squeeze out enormous Chakra!

170
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:41,052
Experience it with your own body,
and grasp the technique of it!

171
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,931
If you don't want to die,
do something about it yourself... Got it?

172
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,655
Now...

173
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:06,578
we'll see if the strength given
to you is really yours.

174
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,420
If I don't grab onto this... I'll die!

175
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,842
Now!

176
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,890
It's impossible...

177
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,644
This rock surface is slippery
from the seepage of the waterfall.

178
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,648
Besides, falling in that speed
with the control of Chakra that you have,

179
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,734
you can't cling to the rock.

180
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,904
Naruto, after this...

181
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,698
you can only depend on
the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

182
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:49,204
Open up the key... This time from your side!

183
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,376
If I go on like this!
If I go on like this! I'll seriously die!

184
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,089
Die!

185
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,009
Die...

186
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,604
Today, we'll have
a history lesson outside.

187
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:20,068
As you know, this rock face has
the faces of the Hokage line.

188
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,571
In order from the left,
they're lined up fom the First,

189
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:30,036
the Second... the Third...and the Fourth.

190
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,333
So different from the present old man.

191
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,002
Especially the receding hairline...

192
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,925
Iruka Sensei! Who's the Fifth?

193
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,343
Hmm?

194
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,680
Well, that hasn't been decided yet...

195
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,308
Perhaps it's your teacher here!

196
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:59,107
Hmm... Weaving an occasional joke
to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?

197
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,442
L-Lord Hokage!

198
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,068
Oh, it's the Third.

199
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,529
Hey! Old man! What did you come to do?

200
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:08,491
I wanted to see the rock faces too.

201
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,203
You've come at a good time.
Over this way, my lord.

202
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:25,008
This is the real man of
the third rock face!

203
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,052
The Third Hokage!

204
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,222
The third was called the strongest,
a genius,

205
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,476
called "professor" among past Hokage!

206
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,478
– What?!
– Huh?!

207
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,565
Hey! Iruka, don't say it
in the past tense.

208
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,691
S-Sorry.

209
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,318
Are you really strong?

210
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,861
Yeah, you don't look it!

211
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,614
Yep! That's right!

212
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,449
Enough!

213
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:54,829
To take over the name of Hokage
means you're the strongest in this village!

214
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,582
Okay! I'm going to become
the Fifth Hokage!

215
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,627
After all I'm really strong,
and handsome too!

216
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,214
It won't work with
the scores you have now!

217
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,011
You've got a lot of confidence!

218
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,306
You all are quite young, unlike me!

219
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,269
There might be someone who will
take the name of Hokage is in this group.

220
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,939
You only have one life!

221
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,650
Don't choose an impossible road.

222
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,195
It doesn't matter if you live as
you like and die as you like.

223
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,238
However...

224
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,038
no matter what route you take,

225
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:40,166
remember to protect the
people important to you!

226
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,127
Important people?

227
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:48,216
That you acknowledge...
trust and love from your heart.

228
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,593
Do you have people like that?

229
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,848
Y-Yeah... Dad and Mom...

230
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,851
and I hate him a little,
but my big brother too.

231
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,562
And... my dog Gonta...

232
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,731
For me, it's friends!

233
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,108
Me too!

234
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,238
Lord Hokage, you have
people like that too?

235
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,116
Yes, of course I do!

236
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,660
Really! Who, who?

237
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,581
I have my grandchild...
Konohamaru over there and...

238
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,464
All of the people in this village!

239
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,981
Like you did too, once...

240
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,839
Huh?!

241
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,487
This feeling... It's that Chakra...

242
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,174
This is...

243
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:57,136
Seal

244
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,772
I-It's huge... What is it?

245
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,735
Hey kid, come closer!

246
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:25,373
I want to eat and kill you,
but this gate won't open...

247
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,668
Bloody spell that seals...

248
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,129
You're...

249
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,758
the Nine-Tailed Fox!

250
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:42,557
I see... the red Chakra
was this guy's Chakra.

251
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,771
For you to approach me...

252
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,025
What business brought you here?

253
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,740
Hey! You stupid fox!

254
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:04,913
Since you're staying in my body,
as your rent, lend me your Chakra!

255
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,590
After all, if you die I die.

256
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,344
That's some impressive courage
for threatening me!

257
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,058
That's fine...

258
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,270
As a reward for making it this far...
I'll give it to you!

259
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,111
This is the feeling!

260
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,824
Summoning Jutsu!

261
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
Well done.

262
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,135
Where am I?!

263
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,483
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

264
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,903
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

265

Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry

266
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,702
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

267
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:32,083
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

268
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:38,172
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

269
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,091
Fight! Fight! Fight!

270
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,187
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

271
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,858

273

274
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:09,829
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

275
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:15,793
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

276
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,045
Fight! Fight! Fight!

277
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:23,593
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

278
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:29,515
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

279
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,476
Fight! Fight! Fight!

280
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:42,153
Yay! This time for sure,
I've finally brought out the real toad.

281
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,031
Listen, you giant toad,
I am your master from today!

282
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,867
Huh? No, nothing.

283
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,661
I will be your henchman, boss.

284
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,788
I'm so happy...

285
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:58,044
Next time, "He Flies! He Jumps!
He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!"

286
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,297
He's seriously scary.
I've never seen a toad like this one.
