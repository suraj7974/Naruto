1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,386
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,894
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,281
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,994
For no single one,

7
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,290
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,171
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,966
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,760
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,223
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,851
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:09,695
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,036
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,292
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,879
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,023
Naruto and others are
out there fighting!

21
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,318
We should be too!

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,115
The Weapon Known
as Shinobi

23
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,745
Old man!

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,539
Old Man Giichi!

25
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,165
Please open up!

26
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,335
Let's go to the bridge!

27
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,045
If we all do it together,

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,381
we can beat Gatô and
his men this time!

29
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,137
Inari...

30
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,474
I made up my mind not
to fight anymore.

31
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,310
Even your father...

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,355
The man we called a hero...

33
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,399
He's not with us anymore.

34
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,575
If we were to fight,
many lives would be lost.

35
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,162
I don't want lose something that's
special to me anymore.

36
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,584
No one wants to regret again.

37
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,555
I...

38
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,308
I don't want to regret again, either.

39
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,519
That's why we must fight!

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,982
A man should live
his life without regrets.

41
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,404
I love Mommy and Grampa.

42
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,740
And you too, Old Man Giichi!

43
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,950
I love all the people here!

44
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,875
I finally realized...

45
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,087
Nothing is accomplished if
I just cry all the time!

46
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,506
I finally got it!

47
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:57,321
Inari...has grown into
a fine man.

48
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,119
Will you just let Inari go
there by himself?

49
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,461
Open up!
Hey!

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,173
I'm asking you to fight with me!

51
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,718
Old man! Please listen to me!

52
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,142
Why...

53
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,479
Why won't anyone open
the door to me?

54
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,361
You are strong!

55
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,448
Naruto...

56
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,635
Zabuza.

57
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,721
You were too full of yourself.

58
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,182
You're too ambitious for your own good.

59
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,314
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.

60
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,527
You left the service with
few men under you,

61
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,446
and became a Rogue Ninja.

62
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,451
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.

63
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,120
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.

64
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,039
And you needed to hide

65
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,249
from the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.

66
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,668
Isn't that about the reason why

67
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:38,130
you hired yourself out
to scum like Gatô?

68
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,257
Zabuza...

69
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,595
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?

70
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,059
Here's something I didn't copy,
a technique of my own...

71
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,978
to enlighten you!

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,910
Lightning Blade!

73
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,162
What the...?!

74
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,373
His hand is...
visibly overflowing with Chakra!

75
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,462
You are too dangerous.

76
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,049
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate,

77
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,550
is the symbol of courage
in this land!

78
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:28,305
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!

79
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,683
And your ambitions will
sacrifice countless lives.

80
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,939
That isn't how
a Shinobi is supposed to behave.

81
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
Who cares?

82
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,904
I have always fought for
my own ideals.

83
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,575
And that will never ever change!

84
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,789
I'll say it again.

85
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,040
Huh?

86
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,000
Give up.

87
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,132
Your future is...death!

88
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,933
Naruto...

89
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,852
I want you to kill me.

90
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,065
Please, make it quick.

91
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,447
What are you hesitating for?

92
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,536
I just don't get it!

93
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:38,000
The only reason you are allowed
to live is because you stay strong?

94
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,255
There must be something other
than just fighting...

95
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,673
There must be some other way

96
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,301
for you to make
the others accept you!

97
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,848
Remember when we met at the forest?
Do you know what I thought?

98
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,017
That you and I are much alike.

99
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,438
I'm sure you can relate to me.

100
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,944
I apologize for dirtying
your hands with my blood.

101
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,155
Is that it?

102
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,450
Is there really no other way?

103
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,369
No.

104
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,585
If only...we had met under
different circumstances,

105
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,545
we could've been friends.

106
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,181
Please...promise you will
grasp your dream.

107
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,017
He too...

108
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,480
Sasuke also had dreams of his own!

109
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,659
Thank you...
You will become stronger.

110
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
Hmm...

111
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,623
The super thick fog
has finally begun to clear.

112
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,502
There are two over there!

113
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,711
They are facing off each other.

114
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,879
Huh?

115
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,965
I can't see well...

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,509
Which one is Kakashi Sensei...

117
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,262
One moved!

118
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,475
Huh?

119
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,737
Forgive me, Naruto...

120
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,998
I cannot die yet!

121
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,138
Is this the end...?

122
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,155
What was that?

123
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,339
Zabuza...

124
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,637
Did you say my future
was death?

125
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,893
You're off the mark again, Kakashi!

126
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,150
No...
You're not to go to the bridge alone!

127
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:38,698
I went all over the town,
but no one wants to come.

128
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,534
I have no choice!

129
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,662
But...

130
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,218
Wait!
You're just a child!

131
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:04,683
I may be a child, but I already
know what it means to fight.

132
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,228
Because I'm my father's son!

133
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,402
My dear...

134
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,240
Wait a moment, Inari!

135
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,792
Where did he go...?

136
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:37,048
I didn't notice,
but the fog is starting to lift...

137
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,093
Huh? Is he over there?

138
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,181
Huh?!

139
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,570
What the heck is going on here?!

140
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,245
Isn't that the masked boy?

141
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,209
I didn't expect him to jump in
to save Zabuza...

142
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,219
The boy...is already dead.

143
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,849
You did great, Haku.

144
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,232
Kakashi Sensei!

145
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,860
He intends to slash me
along with the boy?!

146
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,990
That was really a great find I made!

147
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,575
Even in his final moment,

148
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,453
he gave me such
a perfect opportunity!

149
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,005
Haku, bad news.

150
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,260
I have to leave
Land of Water as of tonight.

151
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:09,224
However, I'll return
to this land someday.

152
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,185
I will rule over this land.

153
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,771
To do that,

154
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,276
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.

155
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,945
What I really need is...

156
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,238
I already know.

157
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,115
You have nothing to fear.

158
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,492
I am your weapon, Zabuza.

159
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:31,913
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.

160
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,710
You're a good boy!

161
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,439
Haku died and you were
able to move, huh?

162
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,317
I won't forgive you!

163
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,443
Naruto!

164
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,986
You just stay there and watch!

165
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,635
This is...

166
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,262
my battle!

167
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,560
Naruto...

168
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,522
Naruto!
It's good to see you!

169
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,233
Sakura...

170
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,694
Where's Sasuke?

171
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,660
Naruto!
Where is Sasuke?

172
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,545
Sakura...

173
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,173
Kakashi!

174
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,133
You have no time to take
your eyes off me!

175
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,473
Why don't I go with you?

176
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,103
That way, you won't be going
against your Sensei's word.

177
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,063
Right...

178
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,578
Sasuke...

179
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,586
Huh?!

180
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,949
He's cold.

181
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,453
This isn't Genjutsu, is it?

182
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,750
Don't mind me.

183
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,129
This isn't the time to
hold back your emotions...

184
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:40,935
I-I always got perfect scores
at the Ninja Academy...

185
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,855
Huh?

186
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,777
I memorized all the
hundreds of Shinobi rules.

187
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,697
All the tests were a breeze.

188
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,785
Until one day,
this question came up...

189
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,916
State Rule # 25 of
the Ways of the Shinobi...

190
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,671
As always, I simply wrote down
the answer without batting an eye.

191
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,181
"A Shinobi must never
show his true feelings

192
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,475
under any circumstances,
no matter what...

193
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,685
The mission always comes first.

194
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:27,440
A Ninja must have the strength
of character never to shed any tears..."

195
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,661
Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?

196
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,498
That is so unbearably painful...

197
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,543
Sasuke...

198
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,657
Why...?
Why can't I keep up?

199
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,078
Darn you!

200
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,763
Why you...!

201
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,068
You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now.

202
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,695
What was that?

203
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,451
You still don't know...
What true strength means!

204
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,584
Let's see how things are going...

205
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,385
Goodbye, Demon!

206
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,331
Both your arms have
now been disabled.

207
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,834
You can't even weave a sign.

208
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,089
Huh?

209
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,097
Oh!
You really got it this time.

210
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,228
You disappoint me, Zabuza.

211
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,249
Huh?! You!

212
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,502
What the heck
are you doing?!

213
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,713
Don't you have anything
to say, Zabuza?!

214
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,256
He was your comrade, right?!

215
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,259
You were always,
always together, weren't you?

216
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,845
He really liked you, you know!

217
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:13,351
You really don't feel anything?!

218
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,271
