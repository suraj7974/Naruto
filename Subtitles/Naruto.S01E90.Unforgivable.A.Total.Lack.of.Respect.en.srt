1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,811
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,324
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,711
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,861
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,035
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,797
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,305
Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!

21
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,993
W-What the heck is going on here?

22
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,745
Hmm...

23
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,497
Help me!

24
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,125
Excuse me there, Mister!
Wait just a moment!

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,961
What in the world is happening?

26
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,171
You should run away too!

27
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,714
There's a monster up there!

28
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,925
A monster...?

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,178
What could it be?
This monster thing?!

30
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:20,641
It's a g-gigantic snake!
It destroyed the castle in a flash!

31
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,980
How big of a snake?!

32
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,649
Me too, at my village before...

33
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,277
I was attacked by a huge snake!

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,903
We must hurry, Naruto!

35
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,366
That snake is probably the same one
that you saw before.

36
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,422
Destroy the Leaf Village...?!

37
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,894
And your answer is?

38
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,575
Lady Tsunade!

39
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,662
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk...

40
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:28,751
Your brother and my uncle
wouldn't want any of that!

41
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,753
Their wishes...

42
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,881
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...

43
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,842
And dreams...
Did you forget them?!

44
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,223
I know it!

45
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,852
Even if you are like this now,
you still...

46
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,398
Open your eyes! Wake up, please!

47
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,650
Shut up, Shizune!

48
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,421
You don't have to answer right now.

49
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,883
However, I want it in a week.

50
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,596
Also, two human sacrifices are needed
for this Forbidden Jutsu,

51
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,100
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.

52
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,147
Lady Tsunade, let's kill them right here!
It's our chance!

53
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,401
With you and me, now we can...!

54
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:42,908
Lady Tsunade...

55
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,449
Sure, I am weak now.

56
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,867
However...

57
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:31,040
I also know Tsunade's weakness.

58
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:36,462
That's right, he is one of the Sannin
like Tsunade.

59
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,255
So he knows that...

60
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,428
I see it's not cured yet...

61
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,931
your fear of blood.

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,144
Hemophobia...?

63
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,650
Shall we get going, Kabuto?

64
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,824
Tsunade... I'll be expecting
a favorable answer from you.

65
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,685
Looks like we were a little too late...

66
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,606
Is this that snake's doing, too?!

67
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,316
– Let's go, Naruto!
– Huh?

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,276
Tsunade isn't here any more.

69
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,655
Geez, you keep telling me that...!

70
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,332
Welcome!

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,001
Hey, you ol' man, give me another shot!

72
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,003
Lady Tsunade, you're drinking too much!

73
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,679
Lady Tsunade...

74
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,351
Heck, she's nowhere to be found!

75
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,187
Dragging me around here and there,

76
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,357
but after all,
we haven't found a single trace!

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,483
Hmm?

78
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,779
Well, let's dine here for now.

79
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:30,284
Huh?
Isn't this a pub?

80
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,202
So what?

81
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,415
I've told you so many times!
I'm still underage!

82
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:42,838
You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.
Kids should only be eating snacks.

83
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,590
– Well then...
– Welcome!

84
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,134
There's no need to dine here!

85
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,635
We can go to a ramen noodle shop
or something!

86
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,932
How stupid! You can gather information
in this type of place...

87
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,398
Huh...?

88
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,816
Huh?!

89
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,235
Tsunade!

90
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,654
Jiraiya?!

91
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,115
Why...are you here?

92
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,328
I've finally found you!
I'm exhausted...

93
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,623
That gal is Tsunade?!

94
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,339
She's 50 years old for real?

95
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,633
Now, that's a swindle.

96
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,850
I can't believe...
I met two of the Sannin in one day.

97
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,730
Here you are!

98
00:08:54,284 --> 00:09:00,040
In any case...
Today is a day I see many old friends.

99
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,218
You mean Orochimaru...

100
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,222
What happened?

101
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,729
Nothing, really.
We exchanged a greeting.

102
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,374
Is it really true that this gal
is the Kunoichi

103
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,377
who can heal any kind of wound?

104
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,088
What about you?

105
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,424
What do you want from me?

106
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,554
I'll be straight with you.

107
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:07,649
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

108
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,204
Hey, ol' man,
gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!

109
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,497
All right, in a moment.

110
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,469
The Fifth Hokage?!
What's this out of the blue?!

111
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,721
What the heck is going on?!

112
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,769
Do you know about the Third Hokage?

113
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,483
The Third Hokage?
So, he really was...

114
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,908
Orochimaru did it, right?

115
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,120
I heard about it.
directly from him.

116
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,790
Orochimaru did it...?

117
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,167
Orochimaru?!

118
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,294
Did he really killed the old man,
the Third Hokage?!

119
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,797
Who is this Orochimaru?!

120
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,635
Just like us, he's one of the Sannin.

121
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,305
Why?! The Sannin are all
from Leaf Village, right?

122
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,390
Then why...?!

123
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,725
Who's this brat?

124
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,148
He's Naruto Uzumaki.

125
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,737
This brat is...
that Nine-Tailed Fox...?

126
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,697
Hey, you just hold it there!

127
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,868
I am not done talking yet!

128
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:46,164
This Orochimaru?!
This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.

129
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,417
Who the heck is he?!

130
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,378
He's a legendary Sannin, right?!

131
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,296
Then knowing that...

132
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,632
why would you, Pervy Sage,
leave such a guy alone?!

133
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,050
Besides...

134
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,386
What do you mean this person
is the Fifth Hokage?!

135
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,972
Naruto, be quiet for a moment.

136
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,306
But...!

137
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,725
Just shut up!

138
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,501
I'll say this again.

139
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:39,217
They are demanding that
you become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.

140
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,642
So what's your answer?

141
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,904
Will you accept it?

142
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,498
I'll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved...

143
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:16,796
This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!

144
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,480
What do you say...Tsunade?

145
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,777
Lady Tsunade...

146
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,282
I really don't get it!

147
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,710
Impossible...

148
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,922
I refuse!

149
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,891
I remember...those words.

150
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:15,272
You said those same words
when I asked you to go out with me.

151
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:21,611
What the heck are you talking about?!
You said it yourself!

152
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,405
Didn't you say that
you will bring her back to the village

153
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,615
and have her treat Sasuke
and Kakashi Sensei?!

154
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,618
But what's this demand
for her to be the Hokage?!

155
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,829
And, on top of that, she refuses!

156
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,249
Lady Tsunade...

157
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,127
Could she be thinking of making
a deal with Orochimaru?

158
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,508
Calm down.

159
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,678
There can't be no other Fifth Hokage,
but this Tsunade.

160
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,640
During the dreadful Great War Era,

161
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,767
she contributed tremendously
to the Leaf's victory.

162
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,814
To this date,

163
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,110
there's no one who can rival
her combat and medical skills.

164
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,698
Still more, this Tsunade is
the granddaughter of the First Hokage.

165
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,658
So together with her talents,

166
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:13,204
there's no one else more suited
to becoming the Fifth Hokage.

167
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,665
If she becomes Hokage,

168
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,751
that means that
she'll come back to the village.

169
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:23,298
And then, as I'd told you,
she can treat the two.

170
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:29,137
Besides, this is what the Leaf's
top decision-making advisors settled upon.

171
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,893
Genin like you have no say
on this matter.

172
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,021
Jiraiya...

173
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,441
Unlike your previous apprentice,

174
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,903
this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,
he's ugly to match.

175
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,446
What?!

176
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,367
It's tough on anyone to be
compared to the Fourth Hokage.

177
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:55,080
He had all the qualities to be
the greatest Ninja in all history.

178
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,625
Brimming with talent in Jutsu,
and he had a brilliant mind!

179
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,838
Popular with people and well...
he was as handsome as me.

180
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,467
But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.

181
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,055
Risking his own life for the village...

182
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,895
Life is different from money...

183
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,403
To easily risk it and lose it,
is a fool's doing!

184
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,118
Did she say "fool"?!

185
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,746
Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage

186
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,166
seemed to want to subdue
the disturbances of war above all else.

187
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,044
But after all, they died in vain,

188
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,880
in the midst of their dreams
for the village.

189
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,220
You have changed, Tsunade...

190
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,889
I don't know what
you thought in your heart before,

191
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,641
but to say such thing out loud...

192
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,105
Although I look young,
I'm already in my 50s...

193
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,066
Years change people.

194
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,200
Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei...

195
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,997
No wonder he died showing off
at that old age!

196
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,562
Hokage is a bother.

197
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,898
No one but a fool would take it on.

198
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,694
Why you...?!

199
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,363
– Let go of me!
– Don't! We're in a pub.

200
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,532
I said, let go of me!

201
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,201
Lady Tsunade...!

202
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,873
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage...

203
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,625
It doesn't matter if
you are a woman!

204
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,587
I'll clobber you with all my might!

205
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,933
You're pretty gutsy...
confronting me like this.

206
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,394
Let's take this outside, brat!

207
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,562
Lady Tsunade!

208
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,287
Though I may not look it,
I am one of the Sannin.

209
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,750
Why should I even take a Genin seriously.

210
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,460
What did you say?!

211
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,676
An advance notice for a KO?

212
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,135
I don't mean one minute...

213
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:01,432
With one finger.
This is enough to take you down.

214
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,142
Lady Tsunade!

215
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,352
Well...

216
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,855
Come on, kiddo.

217
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,525
D-Don't make fun of me!

218
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,828
Darn it!

219
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,253
Lady Tsunade!

220
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,135
Forehead poking?!

221
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,845
Why that no good...!

222
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,269
She's strong...

223
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,272
Hey, brat!

224
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,151
I'll ask you one thing before you faint.

225
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,866
Why...get so passionate at
the mention of Hokage's name?

226
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,082
Unlike you...

227
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,419
I will be the heir to the Hokage name,
no matter what!

228
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,298
Because Hokage is...

229
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,011
Because Hokage is my dream!

230
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
That kid...

231
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,360
What? She's a bit off her guard...

232
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,946
I can't tackle her head on.

233
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,989
Then, I should use that Jutsu now...

234
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,449
Concentrate!

235
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,587
Oh, no!

236
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,091
Wha...?! This Jutsu is...!

237
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,635
Take this!

238
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,144
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

239
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:15,066
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

240
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,320
On your still shoulder

241
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,617
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

242
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:30,456
The city lights are like pieces of stars

243
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,128
That hold us together

244
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,841
"Each one of us

245
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

246
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,515
you say laughingly

247
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:53,646
but you look most dazzling

248
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,109
Like a comet,

249
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:04,282
like the rainbow after the storm

250
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:10,121
You bring light into

251
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,539
my heart

252
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,961
Being lost

253
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:22,467
can be the answer

254
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:28,347
Let's promise

255
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,726
we won't cheat

256
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,104
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

257
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,693
It's been a long time since we drank
alone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?

258
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,820
I didn't necessarily want to see you.

259
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,030
Don't say that.

260
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,449
By the way,
you're prettier than before.

261
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,867
You haven't changed a bit.

262
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,162
Understand this.
I'm not interested in you.

263
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:54,665
Neither am I.
After all, you're actually 50 years old...

264
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,125
– Did you say something?
– No, nothing.

265
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,878
I was just remembering
the old days.

266
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,341
Next time: "Inheritance!
"The Necklace of Death!"
