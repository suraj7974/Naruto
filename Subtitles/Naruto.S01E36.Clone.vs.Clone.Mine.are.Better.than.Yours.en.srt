1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,482
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,086
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,797
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,576
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,889
I've...had it...

19
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,098
Oh, Sakura!

20
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:44,271
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?

21
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,900
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.

22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,568
Here we can see it
right in front of our eyes.

23
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,153
Strange...

24
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,030
No mistake about it.

25
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,075
It seems that we're already within
the enthusiastic welcome.

26
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,744
Take a look at that.

27
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,538
Huh?

28
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,665
Oh, that can't be!

29
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,963
What on earth is going on?!

30
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,089
No way!

31
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,049
Is it Genjutsu...?

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,176
So it seems.
We were lured in perfectly.

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,470
It appears we were meticulously careful,

34
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:22,643
and were made to walk
around the same place in a circle.

35
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,688
We're being watched...

36
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,314
Probably.

37
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,316
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,527
catch us unprepared when
we're bone-tired.

39
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,613
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.

40
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,534
Then... They'll be coming soon.

41
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,158
Humph, they've appeared.

42
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,328
This is the perfect handicap.
Believe it!

43
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:28,334
Clone vs. Clone:
Mine are Better than Yours!

44
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,758
W-What is this?

45
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,552
It's quite a number.

46
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,679
Moreover, they're clones?

47
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,642
Cornered rats.

48
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,564
Shut up!

49
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,491
Oh, they're quite weak, huh?

50
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,203
Good!
Naruto!

51
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,181
W-What are these guys?

52
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,070
W-What's going on here?

53
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,036
I'll assess this!

54
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,830
Sharingan!

55
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,503
Naruto!

56
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,603
Sasuke!

57
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,364
Sasuke!

58
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,706
W-What's going on?

59
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,832
My body's...

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,421
Are you okay?

61
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,719
No mistake.

62
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,263
It's the real thing, not an illusion.

63
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,726
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.

64
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:59,109
That Kabuto was injured means
these things are actual Shadow Clones?!

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,530
B-But...even though Shadow clones
are supposed to vanish

66
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,075
if they take a direct attack,
these things don't vanish.

67
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,660
Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!

68
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:09,995
Which is it?!

69
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,914
Scroll please.

70
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,416
Scroll please.

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,710
Give me scroll.

72
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,545
Dang it!

73
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,005
It's futile!

74
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,465
Stop!

75
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,845
These things are illusions.

76
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,514
It's an enemy Genjutsu.

77
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:34,645
B-But, Kabuto's wound is the real thing.

78
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,607
No, it's as Sasuke says.

79
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,819
Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere...

80
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,863
and coordinating their attack with
movements of the "Genjutsu Shinobis"

81
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,324
and attacking from a different location.

82
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,995
Pretending as if those
Genjutsu Shinobis are attacking.

83
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,042
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.

84
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,550
Then I'll find the idiot who's behind
the scenes

85
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,010
throwing Kunai knives
and kick his butt, believe it!

86
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,554
Hold it, Naruto.

87
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,599
We've been deceived as
to the source of the Kunai knives...

88
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,144
so we can't discover the precise
location of the enemy like this.

89
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,562
Do you get it?

90
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,689
That is the enemy's purpose.

91
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,235
From a data standpoint, it's a type
who is weak at close combat

92
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,737
and Taijutsu that likes
this kind of attack.

93
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:31,577
The true enemy won't come out
until we can't move at all.

94
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,333
Listen, everyone!
In any case,

95
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,878
all there is to do now is to fend
off the enemy attack.

96
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:48,260
Fine, if that's what their plan is...

97
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,805
Now then...
I wonder how far they can hold out.

98
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,683
The night is long.

99
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,080
Man!
This is endless!

100
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,958
Since it's come to this...!

101
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,126
Stop!

102
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,338
Naruto, don't waste your Chakra!

103
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,049
Even if you attack these things,
there's no point!

104
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,761
If I hit them all in
a single sweep,

105
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,932
the enemy won't fire inadvertently
while these things are reverting back.

106
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,808
The hiding place will
be discovered, so.

107
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,811
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

108
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,526
Shadow Clones?!

109
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,800
It's not over yet!

110
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,094
Sasuke, what should we do...?

111
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,431
Man, that loser.
All there is to do is go for it!

112
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,516
B-But...

113
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,767
Indeed...

114
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,687
It's not a situation that
he can get through by himself.

115
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,647
Let's go, Sakura!

116
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,065
Y-Yeah!

117
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,217
I'm not finished yet...

118
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,518
Dawn is breaking.

119
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,521
It's finally time for the hunt.

120
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,940
Mubi, that's enough.

121
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,319
We're finished hunting their spirits.

122
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,031
Now what's left is just their bodies.

123
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,034
Lucky.

124
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:24,624
You're...the one who...
did my left shoulder.

125
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,544
I finally found you.

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,464
You really hung me up.

127
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,341
Lucky.

128
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,217
I can finally even the score.

129
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,564
You...really hung me up.

130
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,566
Lucky.

131
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,027
I can finally even the score.

132
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,995
Heh!

133
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,457
Cornered rats.

134
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,088
It went well, Naruto!

135
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,892
W-What the heck
are these guys?!

136
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,978
T-This can't be!

137
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,313
Since when...?!

138
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,856
Idiot!

139
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,235
You finally showed your
true colors, punk!

140
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,744
T-This brat, don't tell me...

141
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,747
The Shadow Clone is just
the preparation for the trick...

142
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,545
for me to portray every member
of the team by myself!

143
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,258
At the same time Naruto
lifted the Shadow Clone,

144
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,136
the three of us hid.

145
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,474
The Genjutsu users were
adversely deceived.

146
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,399
Naruto!

147
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,487
Naruto, you've used too much Chakra.

148
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,281
I'll do the rest.

149
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,671
No way! I'm not always going to have
the good parts taken away!

150
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,601
Is this really that Naruto...?

151
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,398
Since when had he improved
this much?

152
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,402
That's some brat...

153
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,196
I can't believe he can still move.

154
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,823
Naruto...

155
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,495
Amazing Chakra stamina...

156
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,960
Right after
a Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu...

157
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,963
a daring technique that transforms just
three of the bodies into his companions.

158
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,842
To think he can still move
even after doing all that.

159
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,637
Here it's the fifth day now.

160
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,849
This kid will transform

161
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:32,521
if he can just master
the use of his Chakra.

162
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,856
Not bad.

163
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,028
But we're still not unlucky.

164
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,407
There's no time.

165
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,246
This time around,
we'll show you our Ninjutsu!

166
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,125
Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!

167
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,383
Shadow clones?

168
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,093
No, they are plain clones.

169
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,387
However, he's up to something.

170
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,513
Be careful!

171
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,517
Hah! If they are just clones,
then there's one real body.

172
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,062
I'll kick their butts right
and left until I run into him.

173
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,272
You idiot.

174
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,023
Such a tactless thing...

175
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,275
I'm telling you!

176
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm saying don't stick your nose in!

177
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,741
Naruto!
That's reckless!

178
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,868
Cripes!

179
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,839
From earlier, the nape of my neck
hurts when I use the Sharingan.

180
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,549
Maybe I used too much Chakra.

181
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,676
Dang it!

182
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,013
Dang it. A clone?!

183
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,640
This one, too?!

184
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,017
This one, too?!

185
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,477
This one, too?!

186
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,021
Naruto! Stop!

187
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,106
Are they all fakes?!

188
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,483
Or could it be Genjutsu again?!

189
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,904
This is... the last...Chakra.

190
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,033
Sharingan!

191
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:19,878
Sasuke!

192
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,798
The bruise again...

193
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,804
Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!

194
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,767
It won't do to create an opening!

195
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,320
Kabuto!

196
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,618
Darn it!

197
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,578
Stop! Naruto!

198
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,539
No matter how much
you swing at them,

199
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,002
the real body isn't in those clones.

200
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:05,048
Then where's the enemy
attacking us from?!

201
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,511
If they are merely clones,
the clones themselves can't attack!

202
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,263
If I knew that, we wouldn't be
having a rough time of it!

203
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,349
This is the enemy's scheme.

204
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,895
Man, I can't use
the Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore...

205
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,940
They've about reached their limit.

206
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,400
Lucky.

207
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,537
That's it!

208
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,163
The real body hides with
the Earth Style Jutsu

209
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,249
and attacks from behind a clone!

210
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,462
Kabuto!

211
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,251
Heh, "it won't do to
create an opening," right?!

212
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,214
Thank you, Naruto.
You saved me.

213
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,344
We're okay here, Naruto!

214
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,566
What happened there? Are you hurt?

215
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,735
That's a terrible bruise.

216
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,988
It's nothing.

217
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,536
Here it is, here it is!

218
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,955
Look, the Heaven scroll!

219
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,457
Good for you.

220
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,005
There's something about this guy...
that I don't like.

221
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,811
Oh, it's you guys.

222
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,771
You're late, Kabuto.

223
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,857
I got a bit involved in something.

224
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:28,983
Sorry.

225
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:34,197
But, but...
thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.

226
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,450
No, it's because you guys fought hard.

227
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,870
You were amazing
at the end, Naruto.

228
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,335
We're going through this door.

229
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,421
Well then, I wish us both luck.

230
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,423
Yeah!
Yeah!

231
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,270
What of the harvest?

232
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,396
Yes.

233
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,689
More than I expected.

234
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:13,236
I filled in his entire data
from this second exam.

235
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,697
You need this, right?

236
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,492
So, how was it?

237
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,662
Sure enough, it appears you're curious.

238
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,622
Master Orochimaru.

239
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,709
I want to ask your opinion.

240
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,628
As a Sound Village's spy...

241
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,089
That's not necessary, is it?

242
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:38,177
You will be the one to decide it all, so...

243
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,558
I like that cleverness of yours.

244
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,645
Good work.

245
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,316
There's nobody here.

246
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,819
I'm okay now, Sakura.

247
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,279
O-Okay.

248
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,823
That's too bad!

249
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,491
Cha!

250
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,412
Say-say, what're we supposed to do?

251
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,456
Oh! Look at that...

252
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:12,086
Without... Heaven...
I don't get it at all.

253
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,171
If "Heaven" does not exist,

254
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,797
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

255
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,882
If "Earth" does not exist,

256
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,967
run the fields in search
of an advantage.

257
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,886
Open the series of
Heaven and Earth,

258
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,846
and the perilous way
shall be redressed...

259
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,601
This is namely the secret of
"the one that guides..."

260
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,436
What's that?

261
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,441
It looks like there are letters
or something missing there.

262
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,985
It's probably has to do with the scroll.

263
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,949
I think this means we're supposed
to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.

264
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,721
Okay then, I'm going to open it.

265
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,269
Hey, can you hear it?

266
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:17,276
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

267
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:26,703
The ocean spans limitlessly

268
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:35,712
Please keep that smile on your face forever

269
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:42,719
Or else I'll cry

270
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:47,140
You won't have to search around you

271
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:51,352
It's all ok now.

272
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,897
Everyone

273
00:21:54,981 --> 00:22:00,194
is inside
this hand

274
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,116
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

275
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,787
When you forget what happiness is

276
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,875
Just sing.

277
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,047
Light is born, and darkness was born

278
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,299
The two are one

279
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:28,056
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

280
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,728
Hey, can you hear it?

281
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,816
What's this, what's this?

282
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,194
Here I thought that the really
strong ones were remaining,

283
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,031
but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru,
all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.

284
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
And that Lee's team, too.

285
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,619
So much for getting all inflated.

286
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,413
Well, I'm the man who's going
to become the Hokage.

287
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,582
I must impress them and

288
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,628
show that I'm not in the same class
as any ordinary blockhead!

289
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,632
