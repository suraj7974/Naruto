1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,357
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,585
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,336
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,965
Now

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,456
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,858
Sasuke!

19
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,362
Naruto's certainly different
from you, Sasuke.

20
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,864
He's a klutz and kind of gets in the way.

21
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,326
But he's not in the least a coward!

22
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,578
Right? Isn't that's right?!

23
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,705
Sasuke!

24
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,178
You foolish little brother.

25
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,850
If you want to kill me, resent me,
hate me and...

26
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:25,312
continue to live your ugly life.

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,815
No...

28
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,986
Flee.

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,031
Flee and hang on to your life.

30
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,658
No!

31
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,413
No!

32
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,213
The Sharingan Revived: Dragon-Flame Jutsu!

33
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,802
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan...

34
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,680
His blood has begun to stir...

35
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,643
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.

36
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,399
I have to live so I can kill
my older brother...

37
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,901
That's what I thought.

38
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,363
But it's me who was being stupid.

39
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,282
Naruto! Sakura!

40
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,118
How can someone who can't put
his life on the line at a place like this...

41
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,329
beat that man?!

42
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,064
I can see.

43
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,163
I can see!

44
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,999
I can see you!

45
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,899
It's pretty good...

46
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:37,569
You foretell my movements and
your aim is sure.

47
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,822
You can see my moves, can't you?

48
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,793
The sun will set soon...

49
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,963
I must find him quickly!

50
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,259
It will become completely dark
and my disadvantage will increase.

51
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:06,640
But why in the world right now...
what's his goal?

52
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,602
Well, that's fine...

53
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,939
He came to this village.
I'll settle this here and now.

54
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,746
I got you!

55
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,940
A substitution!

56
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,381
Sasuke!

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,597
Humph! You are too easy.

58
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,558
The Uchiha name is crying.

59
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,018
That's okay.

60
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,522
I'll just take my time and play
with you before I'll kill you.

61
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,900
Like a worm.

62
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:01,839
This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!

63
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,974
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.

64
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,862
He did it!

65
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,427
Sasuke!

66
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,470
You did it!

67
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,975
Are you okay?

68
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,685
Hang on.

69
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,784
Paralysis?

70
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:18,040
I didn't expect that you could use
Sharingan this much at your age.

71
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,251
You are truly a member of the Uchiha clan.

72
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,213
I do want you, after all.

73
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,928
You're definitely his brother.

74
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,681
Your eyes hide more ability
than that Itachi.

75
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,559
Who in the world are you?

76
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,567
My name is Orochimaru...

77
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,696
If you think you want to meet me again,

78
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,742
desperately run to the top of this test.

79
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,286
-The Scroll!
-Defeat the three...

80
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,248
Sound Village Ninja under my control.

81
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,084
You are not making sense at all!

82
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:06,004
We don't want to see
your face ever again, got it?!

83
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,841
That won't do.

84
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,976
Sasuke!

85
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,202
Sasuke!

86
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,289
You, what did you do to Sasuke?

87
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,001
I gave him a parting gift.

88
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,462
Sasuke absolutely would come look for me...

89
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,464
looking for power.

90
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,886
I enjoyed seeing your various powers.

91
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,941
Sasuke!

92
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,362
Hold on, Sasuke.

93
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,739
C'mon!

94
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,040
Sasuke...

95
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,715
Sasuke, c'mon!

96
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,258
Sasuke...

97
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,886
Sasuke...

98
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,600
Naruto!

99
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,395
Sasuke's... Sasuke's...!

100
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,648
Naruto!

101
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,207
What?

102
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,086
What should I do?

103
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,907
I can feel it!

104
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,296
He's close by.

105
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,278
It's been a while...

106
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,405
Anko.

107
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,992
You're level S class,

108
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,078
an extremely dangerous person on
the most wanted list.

109
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:29,082
That's why I'll kill you here
even if it costs my life.

110
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,085
That is my duty as your former subordinate

111
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,965
who learned it all from you.
Isn't that right, Orochimaru?!

112
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,341
No, you can't.

113
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,858
Striking Shadow Snake!

114
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,493
I won't let you escape.

115
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,598
I got you.

116
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,393
Orochimaru,
I'm gonna borrow your left hand.

117
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,104
This hand sign...

118
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:38,193
Right... you and I are going to die here.

119
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,157
Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice...

120
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,829
You intend to commit suicide?

121
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,551
Substitution.

122
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,946
As you are a Special Jonin of the village,

123
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,534
you can't be just using
the forbidden Jutsu I taught you.

124
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,290
I told you it wouldn't work.

125
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,014
Why have you come now?

126
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,727
It's our reunion after so long,
and you're awfully cold.

127
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,148
Don't tell me that you came
to assassinate Lord Hokage?

128
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,275
No, no...

129
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,194
I don't have enough
subordinates for that yet...

130
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,407
I've heard of the excellence ones of
this village and thought I'd put dibs on it.

131
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,080
A little while ago,

132
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,834
I gave that same Curse Mark as a present.

133
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,254
There's a kid that I want.

134
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,591
Selfish as always.

135
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,551
That kid will die.

136
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:31,306
Certainly... the odds are 1 in 10
that he'll die,

137
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,560
but he may survive just like you did.

138
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,813
This kid, you really like him, huh?

139
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,150
Are you jealous?.

140
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,735
Hey...

141
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,989
Are you still holding a grudge
that I used you and threw you away?

142
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,287
Unlike you, that kid will excel.

143
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:58,291
For one thing he inherited
the Uchiha ability.

144
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:05,215
He has beautiful features and is
a vessel who can become my heir.

145
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,094
If that kid lived,
it will make things interesting.

146
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:13,431
Be sure not to cancel this test.

147
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,978
Three people from my village
are also under your care.

148
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,147
Make me enjoy it.

149
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,445
If something happens to
deprive me of my fun,

150
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,449
consider it the end of Leaf Village.

151
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,339
We've secured food and water after
spending half a day

152
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,009
and now most teams have halted activity.

153
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,763
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.

154
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,058
We'll split up into three and go scouting.

155
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,770
However, whether we find
other teams or not,

156
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,731
we return to this place.

157
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,775
Got it?

158
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,860
Okay.

159
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,194
Roger.

160
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,779
Okay.

161
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,822
Scatter!

162
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,710
His breathing is gradually
getting regular...

163
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,837
but he still has a terrible fever.

164
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,976
I have to protect them both.

165
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,243
I have to communicate this
to Lord Hokage right away.

166
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,986
Cripes! At a time like this!

167
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,061
T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.

168
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,689
So you are here, Anko.

169
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,619
You're pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.

170
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,538
Well, don't say that.

171
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,461
Are you okay, hey?

172
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,172
Huh? T-This is...!

173
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,466
The Curse Mark is appearing...

174
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,385
Don't tell me...?!

175
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,887
Is it Orochimaru?

176
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,389
What, really?

177
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:45,768
Now that it's come to this,
we'll take you to Lord Hokage.

178
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,855
No, take me to the tower.

179
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,607
What are you saying?

180
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,942
The moment Orochimaru comes
to this village,

181
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,569
a strict alert is issued.

182
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,571
It's more urgent than continuing the Exam.

183
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,031
I know...

184
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:03,828
Anyway, I'll tell the whole story later,
so please call for Lord Hokage.

185
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,008
I found you.

186
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,971
As Orochimaru ordered,
we'll wait for daybreak to do it.

187
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,767
Sasuke Uchiha is our target,
not the other.

188
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,021
If they come in the way,
it's okay to kill the other two, right?

189
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,481
Of course.

190
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,103
Hey, can you hear it?

191
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,607
The clear, blue sky

192
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,736
goes on and on

193
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:26,244
The ocean spans limitlessly

194
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:35,461
Please keep that smile on your face forever

195
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:43,094
Or else I'll cry

196
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,140
You won't have to search around you

197
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:51,144
It's all ok now.

198
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,524
Everyone is inside

199
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,944
this hand

200
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:05,158
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

201
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,662
When you forget what happiness is

202
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,708
Just sing.

203
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18,838
Light is born, and darkness was born

204
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,132
The two are one

205
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:27,972
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

206
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:33,352
Hey, can you hear it?

207
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,901
The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village,
Rock Lee, is here!

208
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,779
Yeah, I did it! I did it, Guy Sensei!

209
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,616
Now I can get Sakura's heart,
right on the mark!

210
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,079
You could say, in terms of numbers,
the disadvantage is mine!

211
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,539
But on the contrary,
the conditions have been met.

212
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:58,294
Guy Sensei, I will use that technique
without hesitation.

213
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:03,424
