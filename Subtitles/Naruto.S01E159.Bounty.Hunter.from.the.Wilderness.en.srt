1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,541
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,289
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,781
Hey, Akamaru!

16
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,290
Naruto... Umm...

17
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:09,088
I made you a box lunch.
Eat it if you like.

18
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,256
Oh, thanks.

19
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,223
Wh-What's this?

20
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,812
What the heck's the idea, you guys...?
This isn't a picnic.

21
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,647
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,649
Come on, it's okay, right?

23
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,652
A cinch mission just
the three of us can manage.

24
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,197
You yourself said
you weren't fired up, right?

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,744
I'm not fired up!

26
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,747
It's a mission to catch a petty thief.

27
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,417
It'd be the same no matter
who went on the mission.

28
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,086
Look. Under normal circumstances,

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,339
a three-man team of Kiba, Hinata
and Shino would be fundamental.

30
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,925
But unfortunately, Shino is absent
as he's off on a different mission.

31
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,429
It'd be better if even you were there
than not, right?

32
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,891
What, Old Lady?!
That's taking it too far!

33
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,102
I'll do my best.

34
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,813
This is a mission I kind of
can't get into, though.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,568
There's probably no need to take
the trouble to determine a troop leader.

36
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:17,531
Anyway, your mission is
to capture the man who stole...

37
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,492
the Misogi tea jar owned by
the feudal lord of the Land of Tea.

38
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,162
This man, Gosunkugi.

39
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,250
According to sources,
he's now hiding in the Land of Stone.

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,172
Get over there lickety-split
and catch him lickety-split.

41
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:37,468
Hearing that makes me feel
less fired up than ever.

42
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,139
Here, Akamaru.

43
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,520
Well, missions like this are okay
once in a while, right?

44
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,105
Let's take it easy.

45
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,442
It's a cinch mission, so all the more reason
I want to finish it up quick.

46
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,612
What'll happen if the Pervy Sage
comes back while I'm gone?

47
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,572
I'm sorry, Naruto.

48
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:04,745
I...um, I was so happy to be
on a mission...with you.

49
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,416
Huh? What did you say, Hinata?
I can't hear you.

50
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,128
What're you blushing for?
You're a weird one.

51
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,090
Well, hold your horses... Look.

52
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,343
We'll be in the Land of Stone
once we cross that mountain pass.

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,263
Be sure to fortify yourself
with food by then.

54
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,188
It's kind of complicated
when it's like eating myself.

55
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,441
Hey, this is good!

56
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,028
Hinata, you'd make a great wife!

57
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,279
What?

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,908
Wife...?

59
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,339
Land of Stone

60
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,271
This is the first post station
of the Land of Stone.

61
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,733
Doesn't it look...kind of rough?

62
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:29,371
The Bounty Hunter
from the Wilderness

63
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,482
What're these guys doing...
staring like that?

64
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,821
This doesn't feel like
we'll be able to do this lickety-split.

65
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,868
What is it, Akamaru?

66
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,212
Could it be that Gosunkugi guy
is among them?

67
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,593
Got you, Gosunkugi!

68
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,808
It's a photo.

69
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,477
What, this is Gosunkugi, isn't it?

70
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,440
Three million ryo?

71
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,192
What's the meaning of this?

72
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,903
Look...They're hanging over there,
and here, too.

73
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,370
All right, I'll try asking someone.

74
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,331
Asia Saloon

75
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,291
Hello!

76
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,173
Can I help you?

77
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,509
I have something I'd like to ask you.

78
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,179
What, if you're not a customer, beat it.

79
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,474
Then I'll order something...
I'll have ramen.

80
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,394
I'll have a hamburger steak with cheese.
He'll have milk.

81
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,734
This is funny. Milk?
Hamburger steak with cheese?

82
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,361
And ramen on top of that?

83
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,243
Are you making a fool of me?
Get out, brats!

84
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,871
If it's the money, we have some.

85
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,247
That's not the issue.

86
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,835
Oh... It's dangerous for kids
to carry such a large amount of money...

87
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,087
I'll take charge of it for you.

88
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,382
After all, there are lots of bad men
in this town.

89
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,135
Hey, what're you doing?
Are you still in?

90
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,598
Oh, just a minute.
I got the money. I'll be right over.

91
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,309
Huh? What's with you?
Hey, let go!

92
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,020
You're the one who'll let go.

93
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,484
How about that?

94
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,778
You brat... You want to fight?!

95
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,781
That's the plan... Bring it!

96
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,825
You punk!

97
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,285
Hold it, Naruto.

98
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,412
Naruto, look around.

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,086
This is bad.

100
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,298
Master, milk.

101
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,175
Who the hell are you?

102
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,679
O-Okay, coming right up!

103
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,099
Here you are.

104
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,184
Thanks.

105
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,104
Now, no need to hesitate.
Drink up.

106
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,566
It's a treat from
old billiard-ball head over there.

107
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,114
"Billiard-ball head" means me?
Knock it off, you jerk!

108
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,033
Who would treat some puppy milk?

109
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,661
You want to get killed?!

110
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,177
Bounty, Michizo Manaka.

111
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,638
You can take the credit, Master.

112
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,558
Take the money for the milk
from his bounty...

113
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,647
And the money to repair the table, too.
I don't need change.

114
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,108
He's strong.

115
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:32,030
Are you in the same trade as I am?
Sorry about that.

116
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,996
Wait!

117
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,582
Something you want?

118
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,459
Who the heck are you, old man?

119
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,962
"Old man," you say?

120
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,174
I'm Sazanami, a bounty hunter.

121
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,846
How cool!

122
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,764
Old man!

123
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,144
Say, say...
That thing earlier was cool.

124
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,604
Hm? The iai-nuki?

125
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,692
It was so fast I couldn't see when
you drew your sword.

126
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,069
It was really surprising...

127
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:15,741
I bet that's what they mean
when they say "In a blink of an eye."

128
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,744
Life and death is on the line
for us bounty hunters...

129
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,331
No matter how many lives we can have,
it wouldn't be enough

130
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,958
if we couldn't draw our sword
faster than others.

131
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,961
Say, say! Say, say!
What's a bounty hunter?

132
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,921
Let's see...

133
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:35,010
There are people who offer a bounty
in order to capture bad guys.

134
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:40,599
And a bounty hunter catches
those bad guys and receives the bounty.

135
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,434
Hmm.

136
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,898
Then this guy has
a bounty on him, right?

137
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,859
Boy, that's...

138
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,363
Why's there so much money on his head?

139
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,573
This guy's just a simple thief...

140
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,408
A simple thief, you say?

141
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,870
Boy, this guy's a super A-rank bounty

142
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,540
who has killed dozens of people
for the sake of stealing.

143
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,792
What?!

144
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,168
No way.

145
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,544
Say what?

146
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,465
What's the meaning of this?
I haven't heard about that.

147
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,842
The feudal lord who commissioned
this mission

148
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,011
might not have known about that.

149
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:19,930
Mission?

150
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,474
Yeah. We're Hidden Leaf Ninja

151
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,436
and we came to this town
to capture Gosunkugi.

152
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,605
Leaf?

153
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,819
So you're Ninja, huh?

154
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,489
This is interesting.

155
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,617
So even kids like this
are qualified to be Ninja?

156
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,578
What?! Don't make fun of us!

157
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,331
Well, don't get so mad.
Sorry about that...

158
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,168
I'll treat you guys to something. Milk?

159
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,630
We're not Akamaru.
I want ramen!

160
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,216
Then I'll have a hamburger steak
with cheese.

161
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,928
I-I-I guess I'll have ramen, too.

162
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,805
Okay. Come with me.

163
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,519
Jeez, no way would there be
ramen in a bar.

164
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,897
Hey, old man. Would even miso ramen
topped with pork be okay?

165
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,733
Sure, have anything you like.

166
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,957
What is this? We're rapidly moving away
from town.

167
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,418
I don't see a ramen shop anywhere.

168
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,091
Now then...

169
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,935
I don't see any ramen shops.

170
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,105
So what I said earlier about treating
you guys is canceled.

171
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,860
Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.

172
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,987
O-Old man...

173
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,543
You guys are going to die here.

174
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,546
Hey, old man...What's the idea?

175
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:21,510
To think you guys would know
that Gosunkugi is in this town.

176
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,721
So what if we do know?

177
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:30,685
Gosunkugi is my prey...
I can't hand him over to you.

178
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,898
Knock it off!
You should just go get him yourself.

179
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,318
No, even if you guys are kids,

180
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,863
it's a different story when it comes
to Leaf Ninjas.

181
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:47,118
It's better to have fewer...
wait, no competitors.

182
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,870
Old man.

183
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,915
Here I go.

184
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,840
Hinata!
That's dirty!

185
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,051
Naruto!

186
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,013
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All-Four Jutsu!

187
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,848
Interesting.

188
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,184
Bring it.

189
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,435
I won't lose at speed!

190
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,988
Damn it! Where are you?

191
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,447
Too slow.

192
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,456
Boy...

193
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,918
Now you're the last one.

194
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,754
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

195
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,260
Oh...

196
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,305
I won't let you do as you please!

197
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,985
Over here!

198
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,620
You're mine.

199
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,877
Almost.

200
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,838
Forgive me, boy.

201
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,635
I'll be the one to defeat him,
no matter what.

202
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,667
Akamaru.

203
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,588
Damn it! He got us good.

204
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,882
Hinata, you okay?

205
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,425
Y-Yeah.

206
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:09,678
Where's Sazanami?

207
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,348
Could it be he went after Gosunkugi?

208
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,060
I can't just sit here like this!
He'll beat us to the draw.

209
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,070
Damn it! Where is that old man?

210
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,411
Did he leave town?

211
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,622
Going after Gosunkugi?

212
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,668
Akamaru, we're counting on you!

213
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,493
The most crucial treasure is missing here.

214
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,871
Filthy hyena.

215
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,797
I waited a long time for you
to make your move.

216
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,761
Unfortunately, I have
an important job to do.

217
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,474
Time is valuable.
I'll get right to taking care of you.

218
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,447
Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.

219
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,158
Gosunkugi, here I come!

220
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,207
You can't move anymore.

221
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,307
It's over.

222
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,017
Finish him.

223
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,813
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

224
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,941
Gosunkugi, you're under arrest!

225
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,156
Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,741
Retreat!

227
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,119
I won't let you get away!

228
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,287
Wait.

229
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,625
Boy...

230
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,211
You must not go.

231
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,384
Old man!

232
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,970
H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.

233
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,473
Stay away from him.

234
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,643
He's too much for you guys.

235
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,329
How could such a strong guy be beaten?

236
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,834
Gosunkugi isn't a mere thief.

237
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,795
He's a Shinobi, same as us.

238
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,256
Shinobi.

239
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,476
Sazanami!

240
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,615
Is this one of Gosunkugi's comrades?

241
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,748
9You! As I recall,
you were in the bar before...

242
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,458
Damn!

243
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,131
Who was that guy?

244
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,133
Hm, what?

245
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,804
A wanted flyer.

246
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,642
Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?

247
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,769
No, that's not it.

248
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,065
"This man who calls himself Tokichi
is a major criminal

249
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,735
who has killed a family of three..."

250
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,738
"He has a bird-shaped birthmark
on his chest."

251
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,408
A bird-shaped birthmark...?
It couldn't be...

252
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,535
What is it, Hinata?

253
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,622
I can't tell because
his face is covered with scars...

254
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,292
But he has...a bird-shaped birthmark.

255
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,544
Oh!

256
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,173
He has a bounty on his head, too?

257
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,635
What the heck is going on
with everything?

258
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,782
So many things happen

259
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:28,496
on this endless road, huh?

260
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:34,127
Although you're strong-willed,

261
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

262
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:46,431
What dreams did you

263
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:51,144
chase to get here?

264
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,691
Even I have times when

265
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

266
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,911
When you're sad,

267
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:14,709
I'll be close to you

268
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:20,923
Even on nights when we're apart,

269
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

270
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:32,060
I'll be close to you

271
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:41,235
A long, long time ago just recently,
on an overcast clear day...

272
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,279
It was night since morning.

273
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,617
The righteous rogue Sazanami's
string of his past unwinds and frays.

274
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,036
Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!

275
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,996
Although the situation is
now clear to me,

276
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,165
there are times when
a Shinobi cannot back out!

277
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,958
Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!

278
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,961
Give it up and submit to arrest!

279
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,965
Next time: "Hunt or Be Hunted?!
Showdown at the OK Temple"
