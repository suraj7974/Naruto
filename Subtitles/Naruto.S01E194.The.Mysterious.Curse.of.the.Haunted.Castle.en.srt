1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,928
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,195
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,325
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,498
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:12,740
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:18,496
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,361
Milady, the skies have
begun to look threatening.

16
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,489
We should seek lodging for the night
before we get rained on.

17
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,075
I see. Carry on.

18
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,451
Yes, Milady.

19
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,586
What dense fog?!

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,380
We cannot see what's up ahead.

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
What was that?

22
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,098
Is something the matter?

23
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,808
Lady Kayo!

24
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:43,622
The Mysterious Curse
of the Haunted House

25
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,420
I hear that it happened while the mistress
of the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,

26
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,173
was on her way to visit the household
of her parents in Land of Candy.

27
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,093
Attendants from Land of Candy
went out to meet them,

28
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,429
thinking it odd
that their arrival was delayed,

29
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,099
only to find that the palanquin and poles
had been cast away at the mountain pass.

30
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,520
I am told that Lady Kayo and
all of her attendants have disappeared.

31
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,191
Then, our task is to search
for the Lady, right?

32
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,276
That is so.

33
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,154
Hinata's Byakugan and Kiba
and Akamaru's keen sense of smell

34
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,780
should prove helpful
in this search mission,

35
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,199
and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,952
What are you saying, Grandma?

37
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,455
That I have nothing in particular
to recommend me?

38
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,165
But isn't that the case?

39
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,378
I think that you have
good points, too, Naruto...

40
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,422
Oh! Leave it to Hinata.

41
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,468
Go ahead and list them up
for Grandma Tsunade!

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,930
Come on,
what are my good points?

43
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,935
Er...umm...
Let me see...

44
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,271
It shouldn't be that hard!

45
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:54,151
I didn't mean to make it
seem that way... Um...well...

46
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,071
Hey there, you two.
Are you done?

47
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,657
Say, Grandma, there wouldn't be
anything odd

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,241
happening in this mission, would there?

49
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:02,868
Something odd?

50
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,122
That is to say...might there perhaps...
be ghosts involved?

51
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,085
Ghosts?
Are you afraid of such things?

52
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,545
Well, umm, er...kinda.

53
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,298
There are no such things as ghosts.

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,343
Stop talking such nonsense
and get on your way.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,304
Which brings us to the question
of where to, Fifth Hokage?

56
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,181
Kubisaki Pass.

57
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,060
K-Kubisaki Pass?
As in the Broken Neck Pass?

58
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,312
I knew I had a bad premonition.

59
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,605
Fool!

60
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:35,693
A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such
things. Get to business!

61
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,821
You're scarier than any ghost!

62
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,947
We're off!

63
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,242
Excuse us.

64
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,205
It's always like this with that one...

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,666
Lady Tsunade,
Kubisaki Pass is where

66
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,752
the capital of
the Land of Necks once stood isn't it?

67
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,964
The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,

68
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,509
which met its destruction 50 years ago,
must still be there.

69
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,094
And what of it?

70
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,888
Ruined castles may be found
just about anywhere.

71
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,392
Have you caught
Naruto's cowardice bug, Shizune?

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,270
N-No, that's not it.

73
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,827
Oh, this is the spot.

74
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,912
The Broken Neck Pass.

75
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,166
It gives me the creeps
somehow, I tell you.

76
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,297
It's started to rain. Let's hurry.

77
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,302
It's really coming down!

78
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,932
A castle.

79
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,477
I hadn't heard anything
about a castle standing here.

80
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,520
Somehow,
I have a bad feeling about this.

81
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,024
See, see?! This mission is starting
to seem creepier and creepier.

82
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,319
But this may be a major clue.

83
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,446
Let's go.

84
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,282
Yeah. At this rate,
we'll get soaking wet.

85
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,826
H-Hey, don't be in such a hurry!

86
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,207
What a magnificent castle.

87
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,252
Won't it be sort of rude
to suddenly intrude upon them?

88
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,254
It's almost night.
Maybe we'll be causing them trouble.

89
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,882
Naruto, don't tell me
you really are scared!

90
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,510
N-No way, I tell you!

91
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,470
Pull yourself together, Naruto.

92
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,554
Let's go.

93
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,481
The door opened by itself!

94
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,827
Excuse me, is anybody home?

95
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,371
The lights are turned on.

96
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,833
Please let us shelter here
from the rain for a bit!

97
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,712
Hey! Wait! Akamaru!

98
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,799
Excuse us!

99
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,051
Good evening.

100
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,346
Something sure smells good.

101
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,518
It's still warm.

102
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,353
Was someone here
until just a little while ago?

103
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,740
What's that?

104
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,035
That's one scary looking guy.

105
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,413
I wonder if he's the master of this castle.

106
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,541
If he's the master of this castle,
than that makes him a feudal lord right?

107
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,209
If this is the feudal lord's castle,

108
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,003
then the area around here
should be the capital.

109
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,964
But this is right on the country borderline.

110
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,175
Hey! Akamaru!

111
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,385
What are you doing?

112
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,388
You shouldn't eat that
without permission.

113
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,650
– Naruto?
– What is it?

114
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,235
Don't startle me like that.

115
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,905
Just now, the painting's eyes moved!

116
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,491
You moron. How could a painting move?
You're too much of a scaredy-cat.

117
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,162
The table's set for seven people.

118
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,122
So, what of it?

119
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:21,418
The Land of Honey party that
went missing also numbered seven.

120
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,672
The Lady and her attendants
may still be in this castle...

121
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,925
Let's split up and search for them.

122
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,885
Wha...?
We gonna split up?

123
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,596
Since we're all here together,
why don't we search together?

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,932
What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?

125
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:40,354
Naruto, stop talking like a kid.
This is a mission!

126
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,691
You don't have to scold me so much!
I know that!

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,196
Hey! Wait a minute!

128
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,537
I'm just not cut out for this kind of stuff.

129
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,624
This is scarier than going to the bathroom
in the middle of the night!

130
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,422
This is creepy!

131
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,982
No!

132
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,775
Not again!

133
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,945
Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!

134
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,031
I'm too scared alone, after all!

135
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,915
Do you sense it, too? I'm sure this is
the scent of a human being.

136
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,963
It's here.

137
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,304
There's no one here.

138
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,474
I'll eat you up.

139
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,351
Who's that?
Is someone there?

140
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,479
The ceiling...

141
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,483
Take that, you.

142
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,000
Look at all these books!

143
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,511
The History of Neck Castle...

144
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,973
This was written a full fifty years ago!

145
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,518
"The enemy forces
have already surrounded the castle.

146
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,605
"Our people were brutally
slaughtered and

147
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,316
"there're only few of the soldiers
left in castle.

148
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,445
"It seems certain that
I would not live to see nightfall either.

149
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,740
"But my thirst for vengeance
remains in the castle,

150
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,285
"and I vow with this castle
to consume every last man,

151
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,913
"every human setting foot
within these walls...

152
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,415
"Signed, Gosa Kubisaki."

153
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,125
Consume?

154
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,920
I'll eat you...

155
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,009
What is this?

156
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,353
Gosa Kubisaki!

157
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,214
Crap!

158
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,485
Hinata! Hey!

159
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,782
Hinata! Pull yourself together!

160
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,995
Naruto...

161
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,086
Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?

162
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,213
Kiba, Akamaru!

163
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,511
A castle that fell fifty years ago?

164
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,221
What nonsense!

165
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,016
That is how the scroll is dated.

166
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,686
It says that everyone who enters this castle
will be eaten alive.

167
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,898
True, we have been swallowed whole!

168
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,819
Naruto!
Are you okay? Hey!

169
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,238
That hurt!

170
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,202
There he is!

171
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,078
I-I'm sorry!

172
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,205
What is this?

173
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,709
This isn't the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.

174
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,754
I wonder if this belonged
to an enemy soldier...

175
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,715
There's some more over there.
They are different armors.

176
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,387
Those armors bear
the crest of the Kubisaki Clan.

177
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,850
Let's hurry up and get out of here!

178
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,360
That's the same armor as in the painting!

179
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,781
Could it be...
that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?

180
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,034
Gosa Kubisaki?

181
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,996
What's going on?

182
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,459
He's melting!

183
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,921
What is this?

184
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,340
Something smells really sour.

185
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,260
There is something
strange about this castle.

186
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,512
Hinata!
Yeah.

187
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,849
Byakugan!

188
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,814
The whole wall is covered
with a flow of Chakra.

189
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,275
Why?

190
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,529
It's moving!

191
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,240
This wall seems to be alive!

192
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,161
What if...

193
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:31,997
Gentle Fist!

194
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,926
A-Are you all right, Hinata?
Uh-huh.

195
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,512
I've seen something very similar to this
somewhere before.

196
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,973
The giant toad summoned
by the Pervy Sage...

197
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,100
from inside its stomach!

198
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,476
Inside its stomach?!

199
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,647
Then, I wonder if, by chance,
this smell could be...gastric juices?!

200
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,066
Gosa Kubisaki invoked
the Summoning Jutsu

201
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,319
before the fall of the castle.

202
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,030
But the thing he summoned...

203
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,657
was big enough
to swallow the entire castle whole.

204
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,828
From the time we entered the castle,
we, too, have been gobbled up!

205
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:18,585
But, why would this thing go to the trouble
of transforming to a castle to eat us?

206
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,794
I don't know.

207
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:22,964
What was that?

208
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:28,970
Oh!

209
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,392
H-Help!

210
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,811
Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?

211
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,605
She's embedded in the wall.

212
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,232
We are from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

213
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,568
We have come to help you.

214
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,862
Here, I'll help you out now.

215
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,033
It's no use.

216
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,743
Please hang on!

217
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,999
Oh no! This thing is rounding up
all the humans inside here

218
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,378
and returning to its original form.

219
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,421
At this rate, we're in danger too!

220
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,466
Naruto, Hinata,
we've got to get out of here!

221
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,510
Man Beast Clone!

222
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,391
Fang over Fang!

223
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,899
I am the castle.

224
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:28,279
and by order of my master Gosa,
I am to eat all who set foot within.

225
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,792
Naruto!

226
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,085
Ouch...

227
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,092
I'll eat you.

228
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,595
How can we get out of its stomach?!

229
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,180
I don't know.

230
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,350
If this creature was Summoned,

231
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,227
then there should be
a scroll for the contract.

232
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,522
If we tear up the scroll, then this creature
should return to the world it came from.

233
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,982
Is that so?

234
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,446
– Hinata!
– Right!

235
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,822
Byakugan!

236
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,582
Found it. It's up above.
Probably in the castle tower.

237
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,043
How are we supposed to
get up there in this situation?!

238
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,385
The wall's Chakra have
begun to stabilize again.

239
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,101
Who's that?

240
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,064
Gosa Kubisaki!

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,235
I won't be fooled again.

242
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,988
That, too, is just a phantom
created by the Summoning.

243
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,281
Wait!

244
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,241
He looks different from the one before.

245
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,594
Wh-What's he doing?

246
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,846
He seems to want us to follow him.

247
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,208
Huh? He disappeared!

248
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,961
Naruto, over there.

249
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,838
Oh, it's the scroll!

250
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,635
It's starting to act up again.
Hurry, Naruto!

251
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,303
Right!

252
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,228
This is...

253
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,189
It's the true form
of the Summoned animal.

254
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,652
The concentration of acid is increasing.

255
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,446
Hey, let's hurry and wind things up!

256
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,906
Wait a minute.

257
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,242
What if, when this summoned animal
goes back to where it came from,

258
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,077
it takes us with it, too?

259
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,289
We'll just have to take our chances.
We gotta do this!

260
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,000
Right.

261
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,713
Did that do it?

262
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,339
What the...?!

263
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,968
Naruto!
Naruto!

264
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,515
Over there, Naruto.

265
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,392
It should be possible
to tear the wall at that spot.

266
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,812
Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!

267
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,526
Rasengan!

268
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,084
Naruto!

269
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,642
The lord of this castle must have died

270
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,019
resenting the people
who seized the castle from him.

271
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,774
But, he also led us
to where the scroll was hidden...

272
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,569
Then, does that mean that
he decided to let go of his grudge?

273
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,071
Surely that must be the case.

274
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,490
What's more, he must have felt sorry for

275
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,743
the Summoned animal that
nobly served him for fifty years,

276
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,871
and wanted to release it.

277
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,831
I see.

278
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,167
Then maybe he was waiting
for someone

279
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,254
to release the Summoned animal
from its spell.

280
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,758
And now, it has finally been able to
return to its own world.

281
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,081
On a checkerboard night

282
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,750
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

283
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,755
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

284
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,092
Suggestively

285
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:45,304
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

286
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:51,811
The Trombone gradually going off-key

287
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,982
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

288
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:03,114
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

289
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:08,578
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

290
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,691
How did it go, Bushy Brow?

291
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,610
Hush. He doesn't look himself.

292
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,320
He sure looks gloomy.

293
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,406
The results were bad.
I'd say considerably.

294
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,532
Huh? "Considerably"?

295
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,785
It can't be helped.
It must have been considerable.

296
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,162
Then...could it be that Bushy Brow is...?

297
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,246
Yes... I'm sorry but...

298
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,752
Then he's considerably...
considerably...?!

299
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,839
Next time: "The Third Super-Beast!"
