1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,563
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:25,234
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:49,300
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,928
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,183
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:04,106
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

11
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:11,155
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

12
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,825
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,412
creating a river of tears

14
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

15
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,924
and melting away

16
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,076
The smell is moving away...

17
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,164
I'm saved...

18
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,124
Who is?

19
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,053
Please wait!

20
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,349
The real deal...starts now!

21
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:28,983
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible...

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,529
so, I should've avoided big techniques
that could be self-defeating...

23
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,408
But it seems this isn't an opponent
easy enough to beat

24
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,493
without using my Secret Technique...

25
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,706
Here I go!

26
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,294
I just had surgery
and am not at my best...

27
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,630
But if it'd just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,

28
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,798
I should somehow...

29
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,305
The first gate... The Gate of Opening...

30
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,056
Open!

31
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,977
Primary Lotus!

32
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,904
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones...?!

33
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:19,867
That's some speed... But it's over.

34
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:26,081
Damn it... No matter how much I think,
I can't come up with any good strategies...!

35
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,253
I've had it...can't hold any further...

36
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,384
With me right in front of you,
you can't even howl like a loser...?

37
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,970
Huh?!

38
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,222
Die!

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,308
You're mine!

40
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,728
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!

41
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,781
What?!

42
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,915
Who're you?!

43
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,007
It seems you're an ally this time...

44
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,184
Who're you?!

45
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,187
A Sand...

46
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,773
Shinobi...

47
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,525
ally of the Leaf!

48
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,951
The Sand Shinobi:
Allies of the Leaf

49
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:02,594
The Sand...?! Am I still drunk...?

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,527
Gaara of the Desert...

51
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,952
Gaara.

52
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,999
Is that who you are?

53
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,462
Digital Shrapnel!

54
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,238
Did he blow the finger tip bones...?!

55
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,701
Impetuous...

56
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,091
You...

57
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,555
When you fought me...
you had more speed and sharpness.

58
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,728
Easy to say...

59
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,733
It's not that I'm holding a grudge...

60
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:44,696
But on account of you,
I had kind of a tough time of it.

61
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,368
I see...

62
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,291
But...why you...?

63
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,003
I owe a lot...

64
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,676
to the Leaf.

65
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,804
Sasuke!

66
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,982
I heard that we'd made up
with the Sand traitors...

67
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,484
But to think you'd change
this abruptly...

68
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:27,072
It's not like we attacked the Leaf
for the fun of it...

69
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,449
It was an order...

70
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,995
In the same way
that I'm here now.

71
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,375
I see. The Fifth Hokage
asked the Sand...

72
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,877
It's a big help.

73
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,340
By the way...
has your sharpness gotten worse?

74
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,050
Huh?

75
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,433
Are you going to give up again
or something?

76
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,977
This time, I'll do it for you!

77
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,230
Sorry, but I can't give up.

78
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,942
A man mustn't be protected
by a woman, so...

79
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,488
As usual, you're a guy who's annoying
with the man-and-woman stuff.

80
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,408
Even if you act tough, it's totally obvious
that it's bravado, you idiot!

81
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,587
This time you're taking sides
with the Leaf, huh?!

82
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,298
You guys sure are busy
all over the place!

83
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,635
She uses Genjutsu
with the sound of her flute.

84
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,719
Right!

85
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,853
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

86
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,701
Blowing away the sounds of the flute

87
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,955
and being able to nail the opponent
with a physical attack.

88
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,957
To think she can attack and defend
with one hand...

89
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,876
Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.

90
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,145
That woman's a natural enemy to me!

91
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:42,040
Has Ukon...just about caught him
according to the strategy?

92
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,262
Puppet, huh...?

93
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,727
You three had been approaching
together, right?

94
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,603
Two went on ahead.

95
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,189
You guys are weak, so...

96
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,651
You idiot... These guys are
out of the ordinary!

97
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,281
Behind you!

98
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,123
I can't...move.

99
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,584
What's this guy?

100
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,673
I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!

101
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,180
Where's the other one?

102
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,642
Hey! Who are you looking for?

103
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,104
That state... I know!

104
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,151
Be careful!
They enter the body and start to fuse!

105
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,653
It's too late.

106
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,456
This guy!

107
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,295
What's the matter, Sakon?!

108
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,360
It seems like...

109
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,030
your Jutsu didn't work...
on the puppet.

110
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,241
This is a puppet, too?!

111
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,496
Let me tell you this.

112
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,959
We, the Sand Ninja,
aren't as lax as the Leaf.

113
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,797
Moreover, don't be carelessly
approaching...

114
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,928
the Black Ant!

115
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,643
He was fearsome
when he was an enemy...

116
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,063
But to think he'd be this dependable
when becoming an ally.

117
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:53,565
Ow... I got careless.
Let me rest in your body for a bit.

118
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,484
Good-for-nothing guy...

119
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,944
Who are these guys?

120
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,738
This is their ability!

121
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,991
Although you were caught off guard...

122
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,912
you getting hammered
by that puppet play...

123
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,288
Well...

124
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,541
Its power and speed
are nothing special.

125
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,669
I won't be beaten
by the likes of such a toy.

126
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,514
And I was able
to heal my belly wound.

127
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,309
I don't have much Chakra left...
but well,

128
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,480
these are opponents I should be able
to tear apart, nevertheless.

129
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:39,486
Indeed, it seems he's healed.
What a recovery ability he's got.

130
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,534
Ordinarily, I'm not the one
who becomes the main body,

131
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,161
so it's hard to move, damn it.

132
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,705
You sure are mocking us...

133
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,376
He's not an opponent
you can beat fighting head on!

134
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,794
We should retreat for now and...

135
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,007
We can't back down after having been
mocked, you know.

136
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,728
Don't mess with me!

137
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,590
The Black Ant isn't a Mechanism
for attacking.

138
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,009
Primarily, it's just for capturing.

139
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,764
And...Crow paired up with the Black Ant
is exclusively for attacking.

140
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,854
Hey you! Let me out!

141
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,087
Eat this!

142
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,381
Puppet Show...

143
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,844
Hey, let me out! Let me out!

144
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,805
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

145
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,001
The play is over.

146
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,804
She hid, huh...?

147
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,973
Or did she run away?

148
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,643
No...That couldn't be...

149
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,107
I just got here.

150
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,402
Briefly explain the present situation

151
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,862
including an analysis of her ability
and battle style.

152
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,492
First off, her fundamental tactic is
ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu

153
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,411
with the sound of her flute.

154
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,831
And then she delivers physical attacks
to that opening.

155
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,960
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

156
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,762
This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?

157
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,935
I can't move my body...!

158
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,858
I believe this was your last hand, right?

159
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,360
Unfortunately...
this is reversed checkmate!

160
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,029
You little rat!

161
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,033
She's a classic Genjutsu-style
distance range type.

162
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,871
Most likely, she must've seen your Jutsu
and figured out immediately

163
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,957
that it wouldn't mix well
with her own Jutsu.

164
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,168
And it's two against one, too.

165
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:28,047
She'll never appear before us again
until she casts her Genjutsu.

166
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
Sound, huh...?

167
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,801
Yeah...

168
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,056
Genjutsu generally appeal
to the five senses of people...

169
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,811
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.

170
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:49,068
The type that uses hearing
is the most troublesome of them all.

171
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:56,659
After she cleverly takes a distance on you
and then hides...

172
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,079
you have no idea where the Genjutsu
will be cast from or when.

173
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,833
The idea is for us to already be cast
by the Genjutsu

174
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,920
by the time we've figured out where she is
by the sound of the flute...

175
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,801
Ouch...

176
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:18,431
In my opinion, we're at an
overwhelming disadvantage.

177
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,061
A battle with this type, essentially,
wouldn't even be worth talking about

178
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,647
without sensor types
like Kiba or Neji.

179
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:31,277
At this rate, we'll get pushed into a corner
sooner or later.

180
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,823
– We should just retreat...
– Who asked for your opinion?!

181
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,118
I told you to just explain the situation.

182
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,083
Don't misjudge my power...

183
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,503
If she thinks
she's hiding well from me...

184
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:53,007
in a distance enough for the sound
of her flute to reach...

185
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,385
she's naïve!

186
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,014
Summoning: Blade Dance

187
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,726
Cut!

188
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,196
All right...

189
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,158
I've made it this far.
It's about time for my Genjutsu...

190
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,827
Huh?

191
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,460
How about it?

192
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,670
It's done.

193
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,424
She's sure...pushy.

194
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:20,136
She's scarier than my mom.

195
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,598
Pretty good, huh?

196
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,018
But well...

197
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,521
I just have to be grateful
for this time...huh?

198
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,272
For the first time, I spoke to you

199
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,609
And you smiled

200
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,945
For the first time, I was able to speak

201
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

202
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,495
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

203
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:32,709
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

204
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,756
My clumsy attempts with words

205
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,303
You listened without turning away

206
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

207
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:57,900
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

208
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,738
I feel so sad
But...

209
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,198
For the first time, I spoke to you

210
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,826
And you smiled

211
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,038
For the first time, I was able to speak

212
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,082
In my own words

213
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,585
For the first time, I spoke to you

214
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,838
And you smiled

215
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,257
For the first time, I was able to speak

216
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,427
In my own words

217
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,057
For the first time, I spoke to you

218
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,651
I got careless earlier,
but it won't be like that now!

219
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,945
Now, you please stand back.

220
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,033
I'm grateful for the help,
but his opponent will be me!

221
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,327
Next, for sure,
with my ultimate Lotus...!

222
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:57,210
Hey, why are you moving forward?
I'm his opponent!

223
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,255
