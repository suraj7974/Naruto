1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,261
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,894
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,148
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,527
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,197
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,286
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,373
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,712
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,966
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,718
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,557
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,517
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,612
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,786
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,875
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,837
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,762
Is this the first time you
have faced a friend's death?

21
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,933
This is the way of the Shinobi...

22
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,189
I won't forgive you...

23
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,002
I'm going to kill you!

24
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,574
White Past: Hidden Ambition

25
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,707
There's murder in his eyes!

26
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,167
He looks nothing like he used to!

27
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,212
He's coming!

28
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,926
What?

29
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,555
His Chakra repelled my attack!

30
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,640
Then...

31
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,612
This should do it!

32
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,744
Why?!

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,082
It can't be!

34
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,674
Could... Naruto's seal
have been broken...?!

35
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,427
No.

36
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,511
This feeling...

37
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,556
True, the seal is almost off

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,851
and the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed
Fox Spirit is escaping, but...

39
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,731
Fortunately, the seal is not
completely broken!

40
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,652
I still have some time!

41
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,113
Do you hear me, Zabuza?

42
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,199
We're both busy people.

43
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,118
I know it's against your style,

44
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,996
but I think it's about time
we stopped playing around.

45
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,919
Why don't we settle this once
and for all with the next move?

46
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,879
Interesting.

47
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,257
What can you possibly
do in this situation?

48
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,969
Kakashi, go ahead.
Show me.

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,851
No good...

50
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,229
I can't hold his aura down!

51
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:18,944
Zabuza...

52
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,034
I can't defeat this boy.

53
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,913
Zabuza...

54
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm...

55
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,950
You...from that time...

56
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,121
Why?
Why stop?

57
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:18,921
Even though I killed your dear friend,
you can't kill me?

58
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,722
Damn it!

59
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,108
What happened to the
force from moment ago?

60
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:44,905
You can't defeat me with
that kind of strength.

61
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,076
Wasn't he someone
special to you?

62
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,956
Is there someone special
in your life?

63
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,543
I want to protect someone
special to me.

64
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,546
I want to make that
person's dream a reality...

65
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,798
That's my dream.

66
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,095
Many people misunderstand.

67
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,016
They pity and don't finish off
the enemy they ought to finish.

68
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,310
They let them survive.

69
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,108
To me, that isn't compassion
or anything.

70
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,486
Do you know?

71
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,657
How it feels to
not be needed by anyone?

72
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,411
To live day to day without a dream.
The pain of it all.

73
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,913
What are you saying?

74
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,751
Zabuza has no use
for a weak Shinobi.

75
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,338
You took away
my reason for existence.

76
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Why?

77
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,759
Why do you have to
serve a guy like that?

78
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,805
He gets the money from thugs
to do bad things!

79
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:56,518
Is that No-Brow
the only person special to you?

80
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,191
A long time ago,
I had other people special to me.

81
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,321
They were...my parents.

82
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:16,622
I was born in the Land of Water,
in a small village heavy with snow.

83
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,833
My parents worked on a small farm.

84
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,002
We were very poor,

85
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,464
but my parents seem to
be satisfied with it.

86
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,009
I was happy then...

87
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,845
They were loving parents.

88
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,224
But...

89
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,185
When I was old enough
to understand things,

90
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,938
something happened.

91
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,274
Something?
What happened?

92
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,199
My blood...

93
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,700
Blood?

94
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,329
Go on!

95
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,831
Tell me what happened.

96
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,670
My father...
He killed my mother.

97
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,381
Then he tried to kill me.

98
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,799
Huh?!

99
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,471
After the experience of
the ceaseless civil war,

100
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,934
people with Kekkei Genkai were
hated and feared in the Land of Water.

101
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,270
Kekkei Genkai?

102
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:26,024
It's special powers or Jutsu
passed on through certain clans,

103
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,946
from parent to child,
or from grandparent to grandchild.

104
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,117
Because of their special powers,

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,413
those of the clans were exploited in
all sorts of battles.

106
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,832
As a result, all Kekkei Genkai
were feared

107
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,668
as harbingers of disaster
and death.

108
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,590
After the war was over,

109
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:55,470
they decided to hide
their special powers.

110
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:01,727
If anyone knew of their secret,
only death could be expected.

111
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,107
I'm sure that boy went through
so much suffering as well.

112
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,903
The greater your power,
the more you were feared.

113
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,576
My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.

114
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,787
She kept it secret from my father.

115
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
She hoped that for a while...

116
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:27,336
No, she must have thought that
they could have a simple life forever.

117
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,510
Look, Mommy! Look!

118
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,930
Isn't it fantastic?

119
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,851
Not you, too!

120
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,895
Why? Why him, too?

121
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,022
That hurts, Mommy!

122
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,528
Sorry...

123
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,448
I'm sorry, Haku...

124
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,867
I'm sorry!

125
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,120
However...

126
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,541
Father had discovered our secret.

127
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,228
When I came to...

128
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,939
I had killed my own father.

129
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:17,571
And that moment,
what I thought of myself was that...

130
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,949
no, that is what I had to think.

131
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,996
And then knew that it was
the most painful thing.

132
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,040
The most...painful thing...?

133
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,710
That I...

134
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,923
that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.

135
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,385
Same with me.

136
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,847
You told me that...

137
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,518
You'll be the best Ninja in the village,
and make everyone respect you.

138
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,065
If someone comes along and
accepts you for who you are,

139
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,945
no one could be more important
to you than that person.

140
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,118
Even though he knew I was from
a clan with Kekkei Genkai,

141
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,913
Zabuza took me in.

142
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:14,377
My power that everyone hated...
He wanted it, needed it.

143
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:22,594
Brats like you won't be needed
by anyone and die like dogs.

144
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,310
You have the same eyes
as I do...

145
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,693
Brat...

146
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,198
Do you want...
to be needed by someone?

147
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,704
Are you willing
to give everything for me?

148
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,094
From now on,
your power belongs to me.

149
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,485
Come with me.

150
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,784
I was so happy...

151
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,871
Haku, bad news.

152
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,251
I have to leave the Land of Water
as of tonight.

153
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,881
However, I'll be back in
this land some day.

154
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,051
I will rule over this land.

155
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,762
To do that...

156
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:52,350
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.

157
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,020
What I really need is...

158
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,271
I already know.

159
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,023
You have nothing to fear.

160
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,609
I am your weapon, Zabuza.

161
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,946
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.

162
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,908
You're a good boy!

163
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,079
I apologize, Zabuza.

164
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,542
I wasn't good enough to be
the tool you were looking for.

165
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,927
Naruto!

166
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,264
I want you...

167
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,351
to kill me.

168
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,321
Ninja Art, Summoning,
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!

169
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,414
Whatever you do won't work!

170
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,959
You have absolutely no idea
where I am now.

171
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,503
However...

172
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,716
I know exactly where you are
and what you're about.

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,842
Kakashi...

174
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,222
You are completely
in my hands now.

175
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,030
W-What is that racket?

176
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,991
What... Just what's going on out there?

177
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,125
If you can't use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.

178
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,002
That's what happens

179
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,839
when you're closing your eyes
in the midst of fog.

180
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,968
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.

181
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,555
I deliberately shed my own blood

182
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,516
to stop your attacks both times
for this.

183
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:01,229
Your weapons have a thick scent of
my blood on them now.

184
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,024
Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.

185
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,402
And their sense of smell
is without equal.

186
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,114
You're the one who
was playing into my hands.

187
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,744
The fog has lifted already.

188
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,539
And your future is...
death.

189
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,084
I've had enough of your bluffs!

190
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,753
Don't act tough!

191
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,673
There's nothing you can do
in this situation.

192
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,301
Your death is certain.

193
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,679
Zabuza.

194
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,765
You were too full of yourself.

195
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,851
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

196
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:54,073
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.

197
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,661
You left the service with
few men under you,

198
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,455
and became a Rogue Ninja.

199
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,794
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.

200
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,296
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.

201
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,799
And you needed to hide from

202
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,550
the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.

203
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,677
Isn't that about the reason

204
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,264
why you hired yourself out
to scum like Gato?

205
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,683
Zabuza.

206
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,771
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?

207
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:30,235
Here's something I didn't copy,
a Jutsu of my own...

208
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,279
To enlighten you!

209
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,044
Lightning Blade!

210
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,129
What the...?!

211
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,800
His hand is visibly overflowing
with Chakra!

212
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,763
You are too dangerous.

213
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,225
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate

214
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,935
is the symbol of courage in this land!

215
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,523
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!

216
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,068
And your ambitions will sacrifice
countless lives.

217
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,906
That isn't how a Shinobi
is supposed to behave.

218
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,575
Who cares?

219
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,163
I have always fought
for my own ideals.

220
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,002
And that will never ever change!

221
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,965
I'll say it again.

222
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,216
Huh?

223
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,010
Give up.

224
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,433
Your future is...
death!

225
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,561
Please kill me.

226
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,482
What are you hesitating for?

227
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,110
No...

228
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,863
What you said is ridiculous!

229
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,407
You're a weapon?
Just a tool for him?

230
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,911
How can you call him
special to you?

231
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,455
Are you really okay with that?

232
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,416
Is that wrong?

233
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,667
Huh?

234
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,629
Tell me, what is wrong with that?

235
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,590
Well, uh...
It's not...

236
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,720
Zabuza counts on me,
even if I'm worthless.

237
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,222
He made me feel needed.

238
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:59,342
But now, I've lost my usefulness
that affirmed my existence.

239
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:04,347
Zabuza no longer needs me.

240
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,896
That's why,
I am now appealing to you.

241
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,360
Please, make it quick

242
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,875
W-Why did this happen?

243
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,713
Is this what it means to
be a strong Ninja?

244
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,299
To protect someone?

245
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,426
Are you okay with that?

246
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,012
Are you really okay with that?

247
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:13,309
I don't get it.
I can never accept that!

248
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,314
