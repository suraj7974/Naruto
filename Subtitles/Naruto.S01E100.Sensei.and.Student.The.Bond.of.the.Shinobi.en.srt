1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,404
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,450
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,662
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:43,461
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:49,842
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,051
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,214
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,141
– Good-bye, Sensei.
– Yay! School's out!

22
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,645
Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!
Good-bye!

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:48,150
Make sure you practice what
I taught you today, Transform Jutsu!

24
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:53,614
And tell your family about tomorrow's
inauguration for the Fifth Hokage!

25
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,741
– Okay!
– Okay.

26
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,663
Konohamaru!

27
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,998
What is it, Iruka Sensei?

28
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,002
Well...it's all right.
See you tomorrow!

29
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,339
Okay... Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,177
It looks like he got over it.

31
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,975
Hey, Lee!

32
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,311
On your way back from rehabilitation?

33
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,813
Um...yes...

34
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,315
I hope you get better soon.

35
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,152
Thank you very much.

36
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,422
To activate each and
every cell all at once...

37
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,174
If it were just one by one,
it'd be a snap,

38
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,343
but all of them together
is gonna be tough.

39
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,512
Still...

40
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,626
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,

41
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,253
so we must do our best!

42
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,342
I think if you had Lady Tsunade take
a look, you'd get better very quickly.

43
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,304
It's better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.

44
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,274
Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi

45
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,199
Clone Jutsu!

46
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,873
Transformation Jutsu!

47
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,339
Hey, young kid...

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,888
The medal of youth is one of passion,
with no looking back!

49
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,682
If you work hard at it,

50
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,227
I'm telling you, son,
you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!

51
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,233
Who is he?
He is pretty overbearing.

52
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:39,363
Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth...

53
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,781
Well then, adieu.

54
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,251
That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.

55
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,752
And then...

56
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,798
Today, you have all become Genin.

57
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,926
I want to hear what
your goals are for the future.

58
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,558
I don't want to answer.

59
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,852
I-I...!

60
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,605
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja,

61
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,192
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

62
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,069
That would be the ultimate for me!

63
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,904
Those are good serious eyes...

64
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,907
You! What's so funny?!

65
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,242
I'm serious!

66
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,079
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!

67
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,042
Don't you realize that
if you can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,

68
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,169
you're not a Ninja in the first place?

69
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,173
Don't you remember being told
that you're the first person

70
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,592
to graduate from the academy
who's only able to use Taijutsu?

71
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,555
It's not because you're so good;
it's just that you're unusual.

72
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,806
W-Why...!

73
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,523
Listen up! If you have passion,
it's not necessarily so.

74
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,739
If you act with passion,

75
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,491
compete with good rivals
and lift each other up,

76
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,576
you can all become great Ninja!

77
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,454
But you know,
you have to work hard!

78
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,372
Passion...

79
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,960
I...was inspired by Guy Sensei.

80
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,631
By his words...and his deeds.

81
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,558
You're late!
17 minutes and 32 seconds late!

82
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,477
Let's not do it today, all right?

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,438
Each of us has 48 wins!

84
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,732
With a win today,
one of us will pull ahead!

85
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,530
I guess you won't give up
even if I say I wouldn't want to do it.

86
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,742
It's my turn to choose the event, right?

87
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,286
Right! What's it gonna be?

88
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,539
A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?

89
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,249
Holding our breath under water?

90
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,543
I don't care, we could even
have an eating contest...

91
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,627
Please...

92
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,848
Okay, then...

93
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,808
Wh-What?!

94
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,645
Rock, paper, scissors!

95
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,732
Rock, paper, scissors?
That's what you choose?

96
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,443
They say that your luck is
one part of your skill, don't they?

97
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:28,448
Plus, it's a great competition
for testing your observational reflexes...

98
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,117
R-Right.

99
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,288
Do you get the feeling
Kakashi's just playing around with Guy

100
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,706
'cuz he can't be bothered?

101
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,166
That's what it looks like to me.

102
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,253
I accept the battle.
There's no way I'm gonna lose!

103
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,340
If I do, I'll walk around the Leaf Village
500 times on my hands!

104
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,010
There you go again...

105
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,720
I promise!

106
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,680
Here we go...

107
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,974
Another one of your special,
self-imposed rules.

108
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,226
He can't do that.

109
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,438
That's ridiculous.
He's acting like a kid.

110
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,567
Yeah, that's impossible,
even for Guy Sensei.

111
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,110
Impossible? Reckless, I'd say!

112
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,368
– Rock, paper...!
– Rock, paper...!

113
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,790
Here you are.

114
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,336
Guy Sensei?

115
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,379
How did you know I was here?

116
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,632
I know everything about you.

117
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,640
I heard that you skipped out
on rehabilitation these past two days?

118
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,807
You can't be doing that!

119
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,569
When I first became Genin...

120
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,949
this is where I revealed
my dream, my aspiration.

121
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:00,916
Neji laughed at me then,
but I meant what I said.

122
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,630
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja

123
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,175
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

124
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,135
That would be the ultimate for me!

125
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,223
At that time, you told me...

126
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,017
If you act with passion,
compete with rivals,

127
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,228
you can become a fine Ninja.

128
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,272
And that...

129
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,565
In order to do that, it'd take "effort."

130
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,112
I was happy to hear that.

131
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,448
– Transform!
– Transform!

132
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,576
Because while at the academy...

133
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:43,125
no one, not one friend or teacher,
said that kind of thing to me.

134
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,718
You put me at ease...

135
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,222
You opened up a path
just when I was unsure of myself.

136
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,684
I realized all I had to do
was try my best.

137
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,115
And when I complained that

138
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,410
all my efforts couldn't match
the others' natural talents,

139
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,163
you told me that I had
a natural talent for effort.

140
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:27,878
That was when I learned the importance
of believing in my own strength.

141
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,846
The chance of a successful surgery
is probably 50%, at best.

142
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,020
But...

143
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,191
this is one time...
even if I try my best...!

144
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,986
and even if I believe in myself,
there's nothing in the world I can do!

145
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,993
Guy Sensei... Please tell me...!

146
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,376
Please tell me.
Can I become like you?

147
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,630
Why did this kind of thing
happen only to me?

148
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,007
Because I have my own
Way of Ninja to follow,

149
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,676
my own dreams and aspirations
that I have to protect and

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,887
prove to the world even
if it means dying for...

151
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,848
What should I do?!

152
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,351
The Eight Inner Gates...

153
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,187
Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that
will destroy the body of the practitioner?

154
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,564
Please tell me!

155
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,942
I'm prepared for the worst.

156
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,236
Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!

157
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,529
Everything is...for my dream!

158
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,034
That means everything to me!

159
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,883
You tried to become a great Ninja
relying only on Taijutsu...

160
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,595
Until now, that's all you had.

161
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,933
It must be so painful for you...

162
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,768
Now that it seems that your dreams

163
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,062
and all your wishes
are being cruelly taken away.

164
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:16,027
It does not matter what his wishes are,
he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.

165
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,574
Lee...

166
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:30,000
If you want to be free of that pain,
you have to prepare yourself!

167
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,341
Does it mean...
to prepare to give up my dreams?

168
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,261
If you lose your dreams,

169
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,889
you will undergo pain even greater
than what you feel now.

170
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,186
Neither you nor I would be able to
go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.

171
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,147
What fools we are...

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,777
Lee! Have the surgery!

173
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,051
How's it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?

174
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,137
It's all about the Chakra, but...

175
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,097
There are so many kinds of cells...

176
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,226
skin cells, internal organ cells,
muscular cells...

177
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,605
You know, it's just a tad difficult
to activate all of them at once.

178
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,566
What's that?
"Just a tad," you say?

179
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,528
Are you testing me?

180
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,987
Oh no!

181
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,533
I'm declaring my trust in you.

182
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,261
I don't know why,
but just a while ago...

183
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,721
I was remembering the time
when you and Kakashi Sensei

184
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,350
were competing
with rock, paper, scissors.

185
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,103
At that time, Kakashi Sensei said

186
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,814
that your luck is
one part of your skill, right?

187
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,778
This surgery is also fifty-fifty,
live or die...

188
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,155
But...

189
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,032
it's not a game of
rock, paper, scissors!

190
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,248
Do you remember what happened
after that, Lee?

191
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,176
500 times around...
It's a promise! Yay!

192
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,930
What's he doing?!

193
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,458
Shoot!

194
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:26,885
If I lose, I'll walk 500 times
around the Leaf Village, on my hands!

195
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,094
It's a promise!

196
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:33,391
He can't do that! That's stupid.
He's acting like a kid.

197
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,072
Hah! This is nothing!

198
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,126
Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?

199
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,295
Why are you doing this?

200
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,424
Kakashi Sensei is not here.
In fact, no one is watching.

201
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,136
When a man stands cool with
a Nice-guy pose in front of others,

202
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,182
he should keep his promise,
even if it kills him!

203
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,228
It's a promise!

204
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,525
What?

205
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,403
Why do you always do that?

206
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,654
Whenever you're about to start
doing something,

207
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,072
why do you always come up
with some kind of crazy rule.

208
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,995
Good question, Lee.

209
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,249
You really know how
to get to the point.

210
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,170
OK, I'll tell you.
But remember, you can't tell anyone else.

211
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,755
What's the answer?

212
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,511
Making self-rules is nothing less than
a practice which brings me victory!

213
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,224
S-Self-rules...?

214
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,809
Are you ready?

215
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,229
The point of these rules is that,
when you're going after something,

216
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,898
they push you into a real tough spot...

217
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,359
It's about chaining yourself down.

218
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,195
For example, on the other side
of the hellish rule that

219
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,490
"If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,
I'll do 500 laps" is the idea that

220
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,616
"If I do 500 laps,

221
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,911
there's no way I won't be able
to beat Kakashi next time."

222
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:20,123
They hold power,
the potential of the heavens.

223
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,583
Y-Yes...

224
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,378
By being chained down
to doing 500 laps,

225
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,590
it makes you get serious.

226
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,302
Even about things like
rock, paper, scissors competitions,

227
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,763
which are so trifling otherwise.

228
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:39,017
And, even if you lose,
walking around the village 500 times

229
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,146
give you the benefit
of extremely intense training.

230
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,607
I see!

231
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,527
OK, I've gotta do a little more.
Here we go!

232
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,572
I'm going with you!
I have my own "self-rule" which is...

233
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,117
Hey! Hey! Don't push yourself, Lee.

234
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,328
If I can't keep up with you, I'll...

235
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,040
try even harder!

236
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,835
That is, I'll aim to be like you.

237
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,673
And if I keep trying,
I'll be able to become a great Ninja!

238
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,721
All right! If that's the case,
then I have an addition to my rule!

239
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,309
If you can't keep up with me
all the way to the end...

240
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,813
I'll put every ounce of
my being into training you!

241
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:31,736
If I train you with all my being,
you'll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!

242
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,530
I promise!

243
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,622
Huh, that's right.

244
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,793
That was the first time you told me about
the "self-rule," wasn't it?

245
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,296
Your surgery will be a success

246
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,799
because you have worked hard
all the way through.

247
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,262
You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens.

248
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,930
And in the one in a thousand...

249
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,725
no, one in a million chance
that something goes wrong...

250
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,938
I will die with you!

251
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,363
Ever since I met you,

252
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,909
my Way of Ninja has been to
nurture you into a fine Ninja.

253
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,204
I promise you!

254
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:32,088
Neither you nor I would be able
to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.

255
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,632
What fools we are...

256
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,306
G-Guy Sensei!

257
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,403
OK, let's go, Lee!

258
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,779
Yes, sir!

259
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,635
Lady Tsunade!

260
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,617
From this day forward,

261
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,412
I am the ruler of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!

262
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:10,144
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

263
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

264
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,278
On your still shoulder

265
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,534
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

266
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:30,373
The city lights are like pieces of stars

267
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

268
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,841
"Each one of us

269
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,554
glows differently,"

270
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,473
you say laughingly

271
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:53,646
but you look most dazzling

272
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,067
Like a comet,

273
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:04,198
like the rainbow after the storm

274
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:08,870
You bring light

275
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,372
into my heart

276
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost

277
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:23,051
can be the answer

278
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:28,306
Let's promise

279
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,266
we won't cheat

280
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,937
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

281
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,484
Darn! He has no hole
in his defense.

282
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,402
Being impatient won't
do any good, Naruto.

283
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,862
Let's utilize the next mission.

284
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,989
That's right. The next mission
requires an overnight stay.

285
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,784
– Our chance will be at the inn.
– Roger that!

286
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,495
Once we get to the inn,
we'll wait until he's defenseless...

287
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,371
– and then...
– and then...

288
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,623
– unmask him at once!
– unmask him at once!

289
00:22:54,499 --> 00:23:00,088
Next time: "Gotta See! Gotta Know!
Kakashi Sensei's True Face!"

290
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,341
'Cuz we're really curious!
