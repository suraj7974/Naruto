1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,637
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:15,224
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,728
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,398
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,818
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,945
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,450
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,662
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,416
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,711
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,131
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,051
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,819
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,448
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,118
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,622
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,630
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,892
Hey, Pervy Sage.

23
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,187
What Jutsu are you
gonna teach me this time?

24
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,358
The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu,

25
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,776
so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,905
Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?

27
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,451
Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!

28
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:01,455
You keep calling me Pervy Sage.

29
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,166
So you have no idea that
I'm a superb person, huh?

30
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,002
Huh...? A superb Pervy Sage?

31
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,005
Nhaagh... Listen carefully!

32
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,010
Toad Sage is only a disguise!

33
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,890
As a matter of fact...!

34
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,185
North and South and East and West!

35
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,897
I'm the white-maned toad charmer,

36
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,984
and one of the legendary Sannin whom
even celestial beings can't defeat.

37
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,902
Such a stud!

38
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,070
That he strikes fear...
in the hearts of people!

39
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,781
I am no other than "Master Jiraiya"!

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,537
Yes... I'm talking about me!

41
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,040
Huh...

42
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:09,064
Jiraiya: Naruto's Potential Disaster

43
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,989
Atafuku Town?

44
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,866
That's ten kilometers from here!

45
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,410
It's "O"tafuku Town!

46
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,663
Hey...hey... Hey, Pervy Sage!

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,501
I'm telling you, it's Jiraiya.
Gimme a break...

48
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,129
So the fact that such
a bigwig Pervy Sage like you

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,424
is taking me along as
his travel companion means...

50
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,011
that I'm potentially a genius?

51
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,304
Just as I thought!

52
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,435
Hey! Hey! Hey! Why did you choose me?

53
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:54,026
A long time ago,
the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.

54
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,741
And you resemble the Fourth Hokage
so much, it's almost funny.

55
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,286
That's the only reason...

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,121
I...?

57
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,832
The Fourth Hokage...?

58
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,880
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

59
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:15,965
W-What is it?

60
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,884
Yeah!

61
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,928
The fact that I resemble the Fourth Hokage

62
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,430
means that I also possess genius
of his level, right?

63
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,808
I'll become the Hokage, after all!

64
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,895
All right!

65
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,652
W-Wait...

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,575
I stepped on some dog poop!

67
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,081
About the only areas you resemble
the Fourth Hokage

68
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,001
are your hair and your stubbornness!

69
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,754
What was that?! You senile Pervy Sage!

70
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,549
Not again!

71
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,567
-Sakura? Come here!
-Okay!

72
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,695
Please take these rice sweets
over to Ino's house.

73
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,780
Ino's house?

74
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,408
-These?
-That's right...

75
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,911
Don't bother them by staying too long.

76
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,538
Because everyone is
very busy at this time.

77
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,250
I know that! See you later!

78
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,969
Oh, yeah... I'll bring some over
to Sasuke later on too.

79
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,721
I wonder if he likes sweets...?

80
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,348
And to Naruto too...

81
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,434
Naruto looks like he would eat anything...

82
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,983
Hey Kakashi Sensei! Teach me Chidori too!

83
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,071
You may say teach me,
but it's not that easy.

84
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,572
What the heck's that?!

85
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,991
That's not fair, show me how!
Teach it to me.

86
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,786
Sasuke... Thank you...

87
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,957
You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?

88
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,253
-No...
-Huh?

89
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,469
For a start, why don't you try gathering
Chakra in your palms!

90
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,304
All right!

91
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,724
The person who rescued you...

92
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,768
was Naruto.

93
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,272
Like this? Like this?

94
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,652
Oh come on, Sasuke,
you're being overmodest again.

95
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,405
It's true that Naruto has gotten stronger,

96
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,366
-but against that Sand Ninja...
-I'm telling you the truth.

97
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:57,251
That kid fought desperately to rescue you.

98
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,838
He showed a kind of strength that
he had never shown before.

99
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,090
Naruto rescued...

100
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,802
me.

101
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,266
Oh, it's coming...

102
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,726
Chidori!

103
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,896
Huh? Chidori!

104
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,315
Chidori!

105
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,945
All right! I'll bring some to Naruto too!

106
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,795
I wasn't...

107
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,591
I wasn't able to do anything...

108
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,345
I don't want to watch a precious comrade
die

109
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,057
right before my eyes ever again...

110
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,770
No matter what,

111
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,941
I will protect you!

112
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,111
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

113
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,244
Summoning Jutsu!

114
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,882
Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.

115
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,345
Compared to him, I...

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,868
While you may able to manage against him,

117
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,829
I couldn't possibly...

118
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,414
He's in a completely different level...

119
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,166
Yeah...

120
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,003
If we go at each other,
we'll either both be killed or at best,

121
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,089
kill each other simultaneously.

122
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,302
Even if we increased the numbers,
that wouldn't change.

123
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,014
I didn't expect the kid's guard
would be a legendary Sannin.

124
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,975
With him as the opponent...

125
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,602
the names of Leaf Village's Uchiha Clan

126
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,940
and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of Mist would be tarnished.

127
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,359
Yeah. However...

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,948
Any strong one has a weakness...

129
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,133
Stop! You will get cursed!

130
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,555
Hey, hey, Pervy Sage...

131
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,806
Huh?!

132
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,559
What kind of a student was
the Fourth Hokage?

133
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,728
Well, I guess one could say

134
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,773
that he developed to that extent
because he was my student...

135
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,027
You're one lucky guy to be taught by me!

136
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,154
– Hmmm...
– Hmmm...

137
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,406
Are you dubious?

138
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,616
A good teacher will develop
good disciples.

139
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,493
That goes without saying.

140
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:22,914
Then, then, who taught you, Pervy Sage?

141
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,207
Me?

142
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,918
I learned from the Third Hokage.

143
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,295
The Third Hokage?

144
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,921
That's right...

145
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,550
The Third Hokage was
still young and lively.

146
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,511
– The Third Hokage...young and lively?
– The Third Hokage...young and lively?

147
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,099
That's right! I was young and lively too!

148
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,268
Young and lively?!

149
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,985
I...I got tangled up.

150
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,197
See... You got cursed...

151
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,327
So you learned from Kakashi.

152
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,954
Then you experienced
the "Bell Training," right?

153
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,831
Huh...?

154
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,958
Yeah! I did! Yes I did!

155
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,097
Only I was tied to the tree trunk
and had one deuce of a time...

156
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,307
What? You too?

157
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,351
Huh? What do you mean by "you too"?

158
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,769
-Huh?
-What do you mean by "you too"?

159
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,022
Why don't you just hurry,
get up and return those things.

160
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,484
Even if you were to say that...
it's pretty difficult...

161
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,866
There are two bells.

162
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,618
The fact that there are only two means...

163
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,079
That one of us has to go
to the tree trunk...

164
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,915
You're quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.

165
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,709
All right! I'll make it!

166
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,296
Come at me with the intent to kill!

167
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,229
Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn't I?

168
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,273
You got tied to the tree trunk, after all.

169
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,566
Shut up!

170
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,317
You flat-chested like a cutting board.

171
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,904
What did you say?! You nerdy perv!

172
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,367
Okay, Okay, that's enough.

173
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,828
-Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
-Okay!

174
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,301
You are hopeless...

175
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,179
Ninja shouldn't be getting caught in
obvious traps like that

176
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,097
over and over again.

177
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,474
But...

178
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,517
Why don't you learn a little
from Orochimaru?!

179
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:52,355
Sarutobi Sensei, you're always
saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!

180
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,065
Hm?

181
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,819
When it comes to snooping,
I'm really good at Transparency Jutsu.

182
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,197
Gimme a break...

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,865
I don't even wanna know

184
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,033
what level of Transparency Jutsu
you possess...

185
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,828
I've never been caught once!
And that's the truth!

186
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,333
If you're that sure of yourself,

187
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,835
I'll go with you next time...

188
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,300
You're such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei...

189
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,930
Huh?! Huh?

190
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,307
What, what?

191
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,685
Hey! What's so funny?! Pervy Sage!

192
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,770
Huh?

193
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,690
It's just as I said, a good teacher
will develop good disciples.

194
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,693
Huh...? I don't understand
what you're saying!

195
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,821
Come on, let's go.
Did you put it back properly?

196
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,156
Yeah, I fixed them!

197
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,578
See!

198
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,474
It appears that they haven't
found Naruto yet.

199
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,852
But don't you think that's strange?

200
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,815
Those guys had already
infiltrated the village.

201
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,985
It should be easy to find Naruto
in this village.

202
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,781
Itachi knows Naruto's face.

203
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,826
Kakashi...

204
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,083
Why is Kakashi sleeping?

205
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,960
Besides, only Jonin are gathering here...

206
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,088
What are you doing?
What in the world happened?!

207
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,924
Nothing...in particular...

208
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,427
Is it true that that Itachi has returned?!

209
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,348
And moreover, that he's after Naruto...?!

210
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
Oh...

211
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,855
Idiot...

212
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,113
Why does this always happen?!

213
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,581
So that guy returned to this village?

214
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,374
And moreover, he's pursuing Naruto?

215
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,709
What does all this mean?!

216
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,929
-Sasuke?!
-Where's Naruto?!

217
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,974
Huh? I just got here too.

218
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,894
I wanted to give Naruto... Some sweets...?

219
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,772
If Naruto is caught by that guy,
that will spell his end.

220
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,067
I'm not gonna let him do that!

221
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,570
Hey old man! Naruto must have come here!

222
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,698
And do you know where he went after that?

223
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,867
Oh, Naruto, right...

224
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,370
If I remember correctly...

225
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,789
Master Jiraiya came here around noon and...

226
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,543
They ate ramen together,
and he said he was going somewhere...

227
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,171
-Where?!
-Hmm...

228
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,092
I think he said to a post station
some distance from the village...

229
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,846
And then he left with Master Jiraiya.

230
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,931
Jiraiya?

231
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,060
Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.

232
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,813
Well, in appearance,

233
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,607
he just looks like
a big white-haired old man.

234
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,943
Big and white-haired...

235
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,612
H-Hey!

236
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,698
Geez...

237
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,491
If you're gonna ask somebody a question,

238
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,576
it's only polite to stay
and have a ramen or something.

239
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,049
Candies are here.

240
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,059
This town is pretty weird.

241
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,077
-Naruto!
-Huh?

242
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,371
We're staying here tonight!

243
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,082
What?! I can still walk!

244
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,918
A disciple should obey his master!

245
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,379
I just want to learn the Jutsu!

246
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,424
That's what's called a disciple!

247
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,759
Huh?!

248
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,313
Oh, oh...!

249
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,738
-Naruto!
-Yes?

250
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,241
Here, this is the key to the room.

251
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,951
Go to the room ahead of me,
practice Chakra,

252
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,912
train some and go to sleep! Got it?!

253
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,205
What?!

254
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,915
"The adult world is gonna begin
from this point on"...

255
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,876
Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!
That's not fair!

256
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,588
That post town isn't that far...!

257
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,512
This! Somehow this always happens
when I'm with that Pervy Sage!

258
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,225
Darn...

259
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,727
Here...

260
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,196
Candies are here!

261
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,158
I've got to check door by door!

262
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,160
Cheers!

263
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,081
I wonder if he really has any inclination
to oversee my training?

264
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,425
What about that one? Yeah that.

265
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,598
See! A hundred out of a hundred!

266
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,185
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

267
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,105
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

268
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,066
This is an inn for women only...

269
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,446
I'm looking for someone...

270
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,116
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

271
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,242
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

272
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,286
Today, we only have old people.

273
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,711
Hmm...this is kind of crisp on the tongue...

274
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,096
Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?

275
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,350
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

276
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,853
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

277
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,937
White-haired...?

278
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
Are they here?!

279
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,609
Eh... Do I remember seeing
some people like that earlier

280
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,985
when shifts changed...?

281
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:59,908
This tastes bitter...
are you all right with it? Cheers!

282
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,411
Oh! A blond kid and
a white-haired old man!

283
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,622
They're here?! What's their room number!

284
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,249
Um...

285
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,753
Room number one at
the end of the hallway
on the second floor...

286
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,063
What's up? Has she already dumped you?

287
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,982
Okay, Okay!

288
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,279
Okay, Okay, I'll open up!

289
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,031
Naruto!

290
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,204
It's not him...

291
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,398
A cycle of hardship, right?

292
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,403
Inside, we were crying, right?

293
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,784
But the one thing we won't give up

294
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

295
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,498
It's a secondary role,

296
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,671
a role in the shadows

297
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

298
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:47,557
let us stay centered, let us stay true

299
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,353
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

300
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:57,025
Over and over, we kept coming back up

301
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,738
Over and over,

302
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,160
we believed and dreamed

303
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,623
Over and over, we've seen fools

304
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:17,962
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

305
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,258
Now, it's our turn...

306
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:28,097
Let us bask in our dreams

307
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,026
Darn it! My body is frozen!

308
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,946
What is this creepy feeling?

309
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,492
This guy is absolutely not
an ordinary person.

310
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,827
He's got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.

311
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,580
He's a member of Uchiha clan.

312
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:57,710
Is this the guy Sasuke was talking about?

313
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,048
Next time: "Roar, Chidori!
Brother vs. Brother!"
