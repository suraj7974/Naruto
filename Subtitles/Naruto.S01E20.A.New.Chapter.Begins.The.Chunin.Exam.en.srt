1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,019
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,861
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,369
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,415
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,177
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,932
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,768
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,112
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,994
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,334
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,421
Rockin' my heart

20
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,149
Here we go!

21
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,570
I'm gonna take care of
my duties with gusto again today!

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,573
Whoa! Mach 5!

23
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,995
A New Chapter Begins:
The Chunin Exam

24
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,056
Oh!

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,767
Good morning, Sakura!

26
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,695
Hmph!

27
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,281
Oh, not again!

28
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,407
These two...

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,536
They've been sort of strange since
we got back from the Land of Waves...

30
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:27,082
Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...

31
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,210
Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!

32
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,670
Cha!

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,267
Well...
Good morning, everyone...

34
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,646
Today I got lost.

35
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,813
Hey!

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,068
Hey, hey...
Kakashi Sensei!

37
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,488
Our Group Seven always has
the easy missions lately!

38
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,660
Aren't there more exciting
missions where I can be more active,

39
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,747
where I can use my Way of the Ninja
and my soul...you know?

40
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,166
Oh yes yes...

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,919
I basically understand what
you're trying to say.

42
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,592
Shoot!

43
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,805
He's always making me
indebted to him

44
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,974
and making himself look good
during our missions!

45
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,767
I won't lose, no way!

46
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,107
You little...!

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,778
Today for sure!

48
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:51,667
Hmm...
You are so much trouble!

49
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,379
That's what I'd like to say!

50
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,341
Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto?
We're going on our mission!

51
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,551
Okay!

52
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,845
You've been so annoying for a while!

53
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!

54
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,745
Hey you!

55
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,163
What?

56
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,831
Oh, Mrs.!

57
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,042
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!

58
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,668
What?

59
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,128
What's wrong?

60
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,548
Those...those aren't weeds.

61
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,175
Huh?

62
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,846
Those are herbs
I grew in my garden!

63
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,599
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

64
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,577
Somebody...help...!

65
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:18,337
No way! Free fall!

66
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,421
Huh?

67
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,220
You idiot.

68
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,358
Hey!
6901:56:47:2301:56:50:03
TRAP FIELD
DO NOT ENTER
Don't go over there!

69
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,113
Hey! Please stop!

70
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,159
That fool...

71
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,871
Oh no! That's because he
stubbornly chose that big dog.

72
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,834
Hey, hey! Wait a minute,
wait a minute!

73
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,509
That's the trap field over there...

74
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,846
Yikes!

75
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,910
Well! It's because you're so reckless!

76
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,330
Geez, you are so much trouble.

77
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,003
Zazuge...!

78
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,007
If you act up any more, I'll finish you!

79
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:50,554
Mmm...
Teamwork hasn't been good lately.

80
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,556
That's right, that's right!

81
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,267
Sasuke, you're to blame for
the poor teamwork!

82
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,144
You're always attracting attention!

83
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,230
That's you, you idiot.

84
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,817
If you don't want to owe me
big time...

85
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,614
you just need to become
stronger than me!

86
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,542
It seems like they're getting
along worse than before...

87
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,386
Shoot...
This is frustrating!

88
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,933
There're plenty of guys outside
who are stronger than I am...

89
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,936
Always making me go on
this kind of lame mission.

90
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,153
Well then...

91
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,323
Perhaps we should disperse.

92
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,870
I do need to submit a report
about this mission.

93
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,872
Okay, then I'm going home.

94
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,458
Oh! Hey!

95
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,044
Sasuke, wait for me!

96
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,219
Hey, how about...
Why don't you and...

97
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:17,224
Why don't we work on improving
our teamwork together?

98
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:23,772
You're just like Naruto.
10001:59:31:1001:59:35:03
JUST LIKE NARUTO

99
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,694
If you have time to spend on me,
why don't you practice a Jutsu!

100
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,365
To tell you frankly,
your abilities are less than Naruto's!

101
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,327
LESS THAN NARUTO...CHA!!
Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!

102
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,666
That's right...

103
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,169
It's always that way for me
during every mission.

104
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,839
I'll never be able to really
do anything at all.

105
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:56,013
Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,
and let's practice together!

106
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,641
Huh?

107
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,020
Sensei disappeared.

108
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,980
Was he being thoughtful?

109
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,236
Huh?

110
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,533
Pretending to be...a rock?

111
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,605
There's no such thing as a perfectly
square rock with perfect holes!

112
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,398
It's totally obvious!

113
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,069
Just what you'd expect from
the man I respect!

114
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,363
You are my rival, aren't you!

115
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,377
Hey! That's too much gunpowder!

116
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,841
With an adult sexiness!

117
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,928
I'm Moegi of the senior class
at Kunoichi Preschool!

118
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,056
I love factoring!
Udon!

119
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,477
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!
Konohamaru!

120
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,522
The three of us together are
the Konohamaru Gang!

121
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,065
Here we are!

122
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,027
I knew it was Konohamaru
and friends.

123
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,657
Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?

124
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,161
We're just copying what
you used to do, bro!

125
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,122
Oh...

126
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,749
What's with the oh!

127
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,961
Your reactions have been
pretty cold these days!

128
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,965
So, did you want something?

129
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,383
See? Cold.

130
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,386
So, leader!
Do you have some free time now?

131
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,221
Nah!

132
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,349
I have to train!

133
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,937
What?! You said you'd
play Ninja with us today!

134
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,190
Oh...? Is that right?

135
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,067
Geez...

136
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,904
If I played with these guys
they would make me hang out all day.

137
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,408
Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?

138
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,167
W-What is it?

139
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,129
So, abilities less than this guy, huh?

140
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,884
You are making me blush
with those stares...

141
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,764
Naruto, who's she?

142
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,813
She's been staring at him with eyes
like she's gonna kill him!

143
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,649
Oh!

144
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,110
You've been busier
than I thought, bro...

145
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,236
Huh?

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,030
Is she your...?

147
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,492
This?

148
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,456
Shucks, you guys are
pretty sharp for kids!

149
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,666
No way!

150
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,210
Bro!

151
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,882
What are you doing?!

152
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,429
No! Leader!

153
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,848
His pulse, his pulse ...!

154
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,812
You ugly wench! Ugly wench!

155
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,401
Huh?!

156
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,618
Nooooo!

157
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,211
Hmph!

158
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,551
Are you all right, Konohamaru?

159
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,596
Oweee...

160
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:12,561
Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!
Is she a girl for real?

161
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,616
Yikes!

162
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,261
That hurt...

163
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,804
– Huh?
– Huh?

164
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,688
So, I have formally received
the report from you.

165
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,901
Is Naruto getting along with the others?

166
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,986
Hmm?

167
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,865
Well, he's doing okay.

168
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,159
I've been busy lately.

169
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,456
I haven't had a chance to see him
even once since his return.

170
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,791
I'm a little concerned...

171
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:24,299
As you know, Iruka Sensei,
Sasuke is also in our squad,

172
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,844
and Naruto sees him as a rival,
which is a little straining.

173
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,682
But, the result is that his abilities
are developing significantly.

174
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,934
Almost to the point that
he might reach yours,

175
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,019
the one he respects!

176
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,313
I see...

177
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,038
I wonder what it is?

178
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,708
Shoot!

179
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,877
Right now?

180
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,846
These guys...

181
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,473
Konohamaru!

182
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,227
That hurt, little punk!

183
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,773
Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!

184
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,235
I'm sorry...
I was fooling around...

185
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,196
What are these two?

186
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,408
Hey stop!
Let go of that hand!

187
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,454
Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...

188
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,417
Let's play with them before
the strict one comes around.

189
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:44,921
Let go!

190
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,092
You're pretty lively,
you little punk...

191
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,227
You jerk!

192
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,990
Wha...?!
What was that?

193
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:17,203
Leaf Village's Genin are
weaker than I thought.

194
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,081
T-These guys are foreign...

195
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,250
Why are they here?

196
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,670
Konohamaru...

197
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,256
Konohamaru!

198
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:29,966
Konohamaru!

199
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,220
It...It hurts ...

200
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,936
Hey! If you don't let go of him,
I won't forgive you! You fool!

201
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,315
You're the fool!

202
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,358
What are you gonna do
by getting him worked up!

203
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,321
You're ticking me off.

204
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,784
I-I don't like little runts anyway.

205
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,910
On top of that,

206
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,037
you're a smart aleck for
someone younger than me.

207
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,291
Makes me want to break him.

208
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
It's not on me.

209
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,178
What's with this guy?
He's crazy...

210
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,766
Well, after this little squirt,
it's the little runt that won't shut up!

211
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,936
You!

212
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,693
Huh?

213
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,828
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's Village, you...

214
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,290
Sasuke!

215
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,130
He's pretty cute.

216
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,716
Bro!

217
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,221
Another little punk to tick me off!

218
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,517
Get lost!

219
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,231
Wow! So cool!

220
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,571
Naruto, you're lame!

221
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,908
S-Stupid! I would've quickly
taken down that thug too!

222
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,201
Hmph!

223
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,996
Sasuke, you!

224
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,375
Why're you always,
always meddling like this!

225
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,378
Hey, come down here,
you little punk!

226
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:38,303
You're the kind of smart aleck
little punk that I despise the most.

227
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,725
Wait! You aren't thinking of
using Crow, are you?!

228
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,152
Kankuro, stop that.

229
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,737
Huh?

230
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,163
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

231
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,669
G-Gaara...

232
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,799
When did he get next to me?

233
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,386
It's stealthy footsteps
on the level of Kakashi...

234
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,066
There is no other reason to
summon you here other than...

235
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,526
As I assume you already understand,

236
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,862
based on the faces
you can see around...

237
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,699
So it's already that time...

238
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,662
The other Lands have already
been notified, right?

239
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,706
I've seen them here and there
in the village.

240
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,417
And, when will it be?

241
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,379
In a week...

242
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,090
That's very sudden.

243
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,306
Now... I will make the
formal announcement.

244
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,101
Seven days from today...

245
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:14,565
On the first day of July,
the Chunin Exam will begin!

246
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,289
Yes, yes, yes!

247
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,041
It's the Chunin Exam,
it's the Chunin Exam!

248
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,711
If I were to win first place or something,
becoming a Hokage would be closer!

249
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,922
There's no way I can lose!

250
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,715
Konohamaru, you think so too, right?

251
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,050
What?

252
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,929
Who the heck snatched up Moegi,
and what 're you gonna do?

253
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,473
Stop, I won't let you get away!

254
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,684
Next time:
"Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals"

255
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,063
As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!
