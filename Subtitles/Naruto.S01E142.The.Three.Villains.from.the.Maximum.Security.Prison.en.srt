1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,507
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,929
The Three Villains from
the Maximum Security Prison

22
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,815
All right!

23
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,738
I can start my training!

24
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:27,565
Right now, this is all I can do.
I can't allow myself to fail!

25
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,658
What's up?

26
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,327
Going to all the trouble of coming
to pick me up like this...

27
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,499
You're on your way to Kurenai Sensei's
after this anyway, right...?

28
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,170
Taking the time to converse
once in a while...

29
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,715
that's also part of teamwork.

30
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,845
Let me hear about your mission.

31
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,306
It was pretty incredible...

32
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,683
But you wouldn't understand
even if I explained it to you.

33
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,480
I don't want Akamaru to experience
that kind of thing ever again.

34
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,026
And for that reason, I must polish
my Jutsu all the more...

35
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,403
I want to hear about it in detail.

36
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,866
Because that's what teamwork
is about.

37
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,868
Are you sulking

38
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,621
'cause you were the only one
who was passed up?

39
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,833
You are sulking, aren't you?

40
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,886
There have to be more further up...

41
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,387
Until I can see it...

42
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,772
I can't believe you're doing
that from the morning...

43
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,198
Neji, let's take a break.

44
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,282
Okay!

45
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,909
– Let's go, Hinata!
– Okay!

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,536
Father, see you later.

47
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,299
Barbecued meat?
This early in the morning, huh?

48
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,760
Just when he was looking good
after losing some weight

49
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,387
when he was released
from the hospital.

50
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,264
He made an amazing rebound,
didn't he?

51
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,976
With that good an appetite,

52
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,144
there aren't any more worries
about his health, are there?

53
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,816
When I'm done eating,
help me with my training, okay?

54
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,109
Asuma Sensei!

55
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,277
Hey, are you an idiot
or something?!

56
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,615
You're recuperating, you know!

57
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,468
L-Lee... Come on,
let's take a short break...

58
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,972
What's the matter, Guy Sensei?

59
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,182
The prime of one's youth waits
for no one, you know.

60
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,062
Maintaining the prime of one's youth
is starting to get tough...

61
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,952
Thank you very much!

62
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,956
Do your best, guys...

63
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,169
I'll master the Shuriken Jutsu by
the next time you're here!

64
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,296
M-Me too...

65
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,051
I want to become a Kunoichi
just like you, Temari...

66
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,386
I'm honored.

67
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,765
I apologize for asking you
to teach at the Academy...

68
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,100
since we're so short-staffed right now.

69
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,644
You probably would've preferred
to go sightseeing or something.

70
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,314
No problem.
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

71
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,275
Yeah... And we were also able to survey

72
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,196
the future potential of
the Leaf's military power...

73
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,657
Well, be careful going home.

74
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,825
Okay...

75
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,834
If something happens again,
I'll come to your rescue again.

76
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,295
Just let me know, crybaby.

77
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,800
You always say too much.
That's why girls are...

78
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,687
Let's kick butt again today, Akamaru!

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,612
All right, everybody's here right?

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,120
You don't need to be so tense, Hinata...

81
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,747
Y-Yeah...

82
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,041
All right! Everybody stand ready!

83
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,463
I can't...lose to Naruto...!

84
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,347
All right! I'm ready!

85
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,810
I just have to wait
for Pervy Sage to come...!

86
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,772
There he is!

87
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,989
But my training...

88
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,492
Don't get so pouty, Naruto.

89
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,662
Some work came in all of a sudden.
It can't be helped.

90
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,582
It's just gonna be doing
an interview

91
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,542
for some obscene magazine
anyway, right?

92
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,878
That kind of thing isn't called work.

93
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,298
It's a mission to gather information
about the Akatsuki Organization.

94
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,757
But if I tell this guy that,

95
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,344
he might ask me to
let him come.

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,846
Humph!

97
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,099
I'll make it up to you by...
Huh?

98
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,186
W-What's this?

99
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,982
It's so that you don't get bored
while you're staying at home,

100
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,776
it's a special training menu
I put together!

101
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,944
Wow!

102
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,988
Wait, wait!

103
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,950
My own prized secret training
methods are inscribed here.

104
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:15,287
Don't read this where
other people might see it!

105
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,538
Okay!

106
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,540
Well, do your best!

107
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,669
I'm gonna use this
to train vigorously!

108
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,504
Thank you, Pervy Sage!

109
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,640
The walls have ears...
paper doors have eyes...

110
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,900
Pervy Sage's secret training methods...

111
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,417
WILLPOWER

112
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,003
What?!

113
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,589
Pervy Sage!

114
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,012
Since I have been entrusted

115
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,848
with the great Village Hidden
in the Leaves that you built,

116
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:23,438
no matter what danger might strike,
it is my duty to protect it.

117
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,858
The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.

118
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,153
Yes, you really do.

119
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,115
Is that you, Shizune?
Enter!

120
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,496
All of these reports regarding
the village's internal affairs accumulated

121
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,208
because so many things
were happening in the Leaf Village.

122
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,003
I guess the only thing to do
is start at the top.

123
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,131
Leaf Maximum Security Facility.

124
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,508
Did its name change?

125
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,760
Yes, in the past
it was called

126
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,471
Prison Specializing in
Capital Offenses Ninja.

127
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,769
Fortunately, because there
is a downward trend

128
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,272
in felonies committed by Shinobi,

129
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,443
along with the downsizing of the facility,
the name was changed as well.

130
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,153
Incarcerated are murderers,

131
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,489
those who were involved in
leaking classified secrets, and so on.

132
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,907
They are all criminal Ninja...

133
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,493
There haven't been any noticeable
disruptions in the past few years

134
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,371
and the facility has been
relatively stable.

135
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,469
– Food!
– Food!

136
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,055
It's finally time to eat,
isn't it, Elder Brother!

137
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,516
Yeah! I'm so excited!

138
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,227
Hey! Fujin! Raijin!

139
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,979
If you don't shut up,
you're gonna go without dinner!

140
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,195
Gimme a break! Those guys...

141
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,033
You may pass!

142
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,826
Hey! Wait!

143
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,997
You're hurt, aren't you?

144
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,791
Go to the dispensary later
and have that looked at.

145
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,584
Okay...

146
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,046
All right, next!

147
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,437
H-Hey, Elder Brother...
Huh?

148
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:33,026
Why is the little finger
short and weak?

149
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,071
That's easy, Raijin.

150
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,407
If the little finger was thick and strong,

151
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,034
then your thumb would
have no leg to stand on.

152
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,954
I-I see!

153
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,540
Elder Brother...Elder Brother...!

154
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,999
– Huh?
– A lizard!

155
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,711
Raijin, you've always been
a dandy one from way back.

156
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,676
W-We haven't had enough to eat,
have we, Elder Brother?

157
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,594
Yeah...

158
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,989
Not asking permission again...

159
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,282
What's the matter?

160
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,950
What's up this time?

161
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,952
I'm starving...

162
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,620
G-Give us something to eat!

163
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh no... If these guys find out
I don't have anything...!

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,837
Um...right now...

165
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:41,470
Don't tell me that
you don't have even one offering...

166
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,974
to these Fujin and
Raijin brothers?!

167
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,517
Well...wait...wait...!

168
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,942
What do you think? Tastes good, huh?

169
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,363
I'll bring you something else later!

170
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,657
Right now make do with that!

171
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,367
– Okay!
– Okay!

172
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,830
Are you okay?

173
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,586
Those guys are quiet
when they have food.

174
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,547
But if they get angry
they're out of control.

175
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:23,428
Yeah...They annihilated all their comrades
over food during a mission

176
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,765
and the people around just barely
managed to hold them down.

177
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,735
Something smells good?!

178
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,112
Yeah.

179
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,241
This way!

180
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,202
– Food! Food! Food!
– Food! Food! Food!

181
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,963
I just can't get to liking clerical work.

182
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,466
There's still a whole lot more to do,
Lady Tsunade.

183
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,139
I wonder what this is?

184
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,892
It looks like a formula
for some kind of medicine...

185
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,186
A formula...

186
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,275
Send an available Jonin here
immediately!

187
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,193
Yes, ma'am?

188
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,779
Hurry!
Y-Yes, ma'am!

189
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,555
How about it...
Does it taste good?

190
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,726
I see...I see...
There's still a whole lot more.

191
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,603
Just as I thought,

192
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,647
that good smell was coming
from your place, Elder Brother!

193
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:02,611
Uh yeah...'Cause Elder Brother
always has delicious food!

194
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,156
It was worth sneaking, wasn't it?

195
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,661
'Cause I'd feel so sorry
if you guys had to go hungry.

196
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,122
Elder Brother...

197
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,958
– A lizard!
– A lizard!

198
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,087
I see, I see...Happy?

199
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,798
How about it, you guys?

200
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,593
Don't you want to eat things
that are even more delicious?

201
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,305
W-Where are they at?!

202
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,644
If we go to the place where
an old friend of mine is...

203
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,314
you can pig out on food
that's even more delicious than here.

204
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,528
Is that the guy you told us
about long time ago, Elder Brother?

205
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,370
Yeah, Lord Orochimaru...

206
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,377
Gimme a break...
that guy's gotta be kidding!

207
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,545
That Pervy Sage...

208
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,089
just leaving me and
my training up in the air!

209
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,925
Come on, don't say that, Naruto.

210
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,885
Master Jiraiya had a mission too.

211
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,220
Heh!

212
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,806
It's probably that
Lady Tsunade decided

213
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,225
that only Master Jiraiya
could do the job...

214
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,351
It can't be helped.

215
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,814
Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade's
doing, after all, huh!

216
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:27,153
Well, I guess all I can do is treat you
to some ramen noodles like this.

217
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,571
So cheer up.

218
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,329
I'm gonna go complain
to Old Lady Tsunade!

219
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,583
Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!

220
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,210
N-Naruto!

221
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,888
Damn... another annoying situation.

222
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,236
Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!

223
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,573
This is about a year ago,

224
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,118
a Chunin Academy staff member
used Naruto

225
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,037
to sneak out
the Scroll of Sealing.

226
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,875
According to the report, it was
a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.

227
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,669
The crime was solved, but...?

228
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,505
Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.

229
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:34,471
The possibility has arisen that
a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.

230
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,182
This is a clue...

231
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,310
This is something that Mizuki
was concealing

232
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,230
when he was incarcerated
in the Maximum Security Facility.

233
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,193
At the time, nobody thought of it
as anything more than a doodle.

234
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,653
Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?

235
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,865
I don't know, however...

236
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,785
The handwriting resembles
the document confiscated from the facility

237
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,872
where Orochimaru was conducting
human experiments...

238
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,251
Which means that...
Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!

239
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,086
The possibility of that is not zero.

240
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:14,177
It's not like a Chunin alone could do
anything with the Scroll of Sealing.

241
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:21,559
It would only make sense if Orochimaru
were pulling strings from behind.

242
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,646
Asuma! Kurenai!

243
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:29,567
Go immediately to the Maximum
Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!

244
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,286
Orochimaru?!

245
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,851
Be careful! Something's strange here!

246
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,144
Yeah... It's too quiet.

247
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,147
Let's go!

248
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,614
Oh, how touching.
A welome party for us...

249
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,910
Yeah...we're giving you a big welcome.
Right, Elder Brother?

250
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,662
Yeah...

251
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,420
Asuma, don't tell me that
those guys are...

252
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,132
Uh huh...The legendary idiot brothers...

253
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,593
Fujin and Raijin!

254
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,267
Asuma...

255
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,650
Hey, you guys are whooping it up
too much for a welcome party!

256
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:58,615
Hey, calm down...
the welcome party's just started.

257
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,297
His character has changed completely...

258
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,509
All you jerks...

259
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,721
You will...be our offering!

260
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,183
Do it!

261
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,067
Orochimaru!

262
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,930
Asuma Sensei... Kurenai Sensei!

263
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,237
Crappy news pass us by

264
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,782
And you become speechless

265
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,538
My voice is way too soft

266
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,083
So you don't answer

267
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

268
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

269
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

270
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

271
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,230
Yeah

272
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:59,986
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

273
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,614
Yeah

274
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

275
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,874
Yeah

276
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

277
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:25,178
Yeah

278
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,151
What's the matter, Ton Ton?

279
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,404
What in the world happened?

280
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,034
Say, weren't you together
with Shizune?

281
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,287
Don't tell me something's
happened to her?

282
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,207
I don't know what happened,
but take me there, Ton Ton!

283
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,210
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

284
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:02,131
Next episode,
"Ton Ton! I'm Counting on You!"
