1
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,305
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,289
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,912
What is it?

16
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,355
Who are you?!

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,833
It was you...?
You killed him, didn't you?

18
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,879
N-No... I don't know anything...!

19
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,687
The Cursed Warrior...?

20
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:13,652
The Cursed Warrior

21
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:24,246
Old man's...snot!

22
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:31,170
I just can't get myself into
training doing it alone...

23
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,634
I wonder if we won't get a mission
connected to Sasuke or something.

24
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:48,312
The Land of Birds?
From such a remote land...

25
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,940
That's what's troubling us.

26
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:55,694
The "Cursed Warrior" apparition has been
disturbing the castle town

27
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,529
and misleading the public, huh?

28
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,950
So they want us to exterminate a ghost?

29
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,787
I declined once saying
we can't go so far

30
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,414
as to accept the extermination
of a ghost, but...

31
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:20,511
I must have you accept this at any cost.
Please accept!

32
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,269
Is it because the money isn't enough?

33
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,564
We in the Land of Birds are
experiencing financial difficulties.

34
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,025
Even this is the very limit
the budget will allow...

35
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,653
It's not an issue of money.

36
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,822
In other words,
it's the mission details.

37
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,366
Be that as it may,

38
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,203
indeed there isn't even enough to
cover travel expenses with this amount...

39
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,621
Now that things have come
to this pass...

40
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,790
I shall commit harakiri...!

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,626
Don't be hasty!

42
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,044
Yikes!

43
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,432
It's the little bit of pocket money
I have saved up.

44
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,227
I'll pay out of my own pocket.
So with this, please...!

45
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,613
And that's why you accepted it?

46
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,866
It's indulgent even for me...

47
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,995
Nonetheless, most of the
Jonin and Chunin are out on missions.

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,622
I was thinking of how to handle this...

49
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,254
I guess someone's talking about you.

50
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,508
Everyone's busy with missions,
so they don't have time for such things.

51
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,480
Who's that guy...?

52
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,982
He's been like that since earlier.

53
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,745
Even tasty ramen won't go down the throat
right being watched like that!

54
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,580
Come inside and eat if you're hungry!

55
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,665
No, I'm not hungry...

56
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,391
So? Tasty, huh?

57
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,644
Yes!

58
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,771
Thanks for your business.

59
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,523
Come back and have Naruto
treat you again...

60
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,027
Again and again like that?
Give me a break.

61
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,697
Thank you for treating me.
In appreciation...

62
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,284
N-No, you don't need to worry about it...

63
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,829
But hey, what's your name?

64
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,081
You're not a familiar face
from this village...

65
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,669
Yes, my name is Chishima and
I have come from the Land of Birds.

66
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,088
I came to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves to commission a mission...

67
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,424
You're flat broke even though
you came as a messenger of your land?

68
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,386
There wasn't enough money
for the commission,

69
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,138
so I even used up
my own pocket money...

70
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,683
Then it must be
a very important mission, huh?

71
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,437
It might even cost an important friend
of mine's very life...

72
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,650
Your friend...?
What the heck do you mean?

73
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,988
Ever since I was little,

74
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,658
I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord of the Land of Birds...

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,287
You're friends with a feudal lord?!

76
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,496
I said feudal lord,

77
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,084
but he was only just appointed last year
and actually he's the same age as me.

78
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,505
No kidding?
Then he's a totally young feudal lord.

79
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,215
Y-Yes...

80
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:50,179
The previous feudal lord,
his father Lord Owashi died from illness

81
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,724
and after that he even lost his twin sister...

82
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,726
Ever since then,

83
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,147
Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful,
has become a totally different person...

84
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,233
He wouldn't show his face
even if I visited...

85
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,991
I'm worried about him as
a friend rather than a feudal lord.

86
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,078
I was thinking something might
have happened to him...

87
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,915
So if there is something
I can do,

88
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,459
I want to do whatever I can,
as a friend...

89
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:25,964
I couldn't...save Sasuke.

90
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,842
But this guy's still...

91
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,302
Leave it to me.

92
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,887
What?

93
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,640
Let's save your friend!

94
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,100
Right!

95
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,067
Old Lady Tsunade! You're mean!

96
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:51,031
Listen, you could at least knock
when entering my office.

97
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,535
More importantly! What do you mean
by fleecing bro of his pocket money

98
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,871
and then not accepting the mission?!

99
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:58,956
Huh?

100
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:04,044
People call stuff like that devilish!
You old lady devil!

101
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,506
Try saying that again!

102
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,259
I'm sorry!

103
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,474
I wonder if Naruto...is okay...

104
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,227
He'll be fine.

105
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,479
You've gotten to know a good guy...

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,691
He may not look it,
but he's quite dependable.

107
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,317
What?!

108
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,153
R-Right...

109
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,532
Who said I wouldn't accept the mission?

110
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:38,161
Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji
to finish his mission and come back.

111
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,580
Half-cocked jerk.

112
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,502
Lee is on a mission with Guy.

113
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:50,924
You and Tenten will form a three-man team
with Neji as the leader, got it?

114
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,221
Then did you hear from that kid
about the mission details?

115
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,974
Well actually, not yet...

116
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,894
It's the extermination of a ghost.

117
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,856
A ghost?

118
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,942
It seems that it appears when
you're walking through town at night...

119
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,863
A ghost clad in white armor.

120
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:15,907
That's what you'll...

121
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:23,915
I-I didn't hear anything about a ghost...

122
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,625
Are you scared of it?

123
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:30,339
I'm not scared. I couldn't be a Ninja
if I got scared at stuff like that!

124
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,095
But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?

125
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,930
Who knows...?

126
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,100
Try testing it out yourself.

127
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,075
Jeez, why didn't you say at the start

128
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,036
that it was a commission
to exterminate a ghost?!

129
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,496
I didn't tell you?

130
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,624
Not even a word.

131
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,752
But that's just a rumor anyway, right?

132
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,462
I haven't seen it, but...

133
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,839
See?

134
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,511
But it seems my master,
Lord Moso, saw it close up.

135
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,721
F-For real?!

136
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,142
The Land of Birds, huh...?
That's sure far...

137
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,192
Village Hidden in the Leaves

138
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,153
Land of Birds

139
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,576
Umm, is there more...?

140
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,745
You sure eat a lot considering
you're thin.

141
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,666
I'm sorry. I'm often called
a skinny voracious eater.

142
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:36,006
Hey, by the way, is there really such
a thing as the Cursed Warrior?

143
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,091
There are people who say

144
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,510
it's the disembodied spirit of
the previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.

145
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,722
The disembodied spirit of
a dead feudal lord...

146
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,392
Rather than ghosts,

147
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,520
tell us a little more about
the Land of Birds.

148
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,397
Sure...

149
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,067
The capitol of the Land of Birds
stretches across the banks of the lake

150
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,819
where migratory birds rest...

151
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,364
It was a peaceful town with
lots of green

152
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,910
and where water from the lake would
be drawn into the canals...

153
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,289
However, after the sudden death of
the previous feudal lord,

154
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,790
there was much uproar.

155
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,378
His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei,
the tactician from previously,

156
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,256
were nominated to be
the next feudal lord...

157
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,260
But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi
was still too young

158
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,222
and was vehemently opposed
to him assuming the feudal lordship.

159
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,934
But in the end, Lord Sagi
took the seat of feudal lord

160
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,727
and the matter was closed
with Moso the high priest

161
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,981
providing tutelage as
a superintendent official...

162
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,696
However, before even half
a year passed,

163
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,867
Lady Toki, his twin sister,
died suddenly...

164
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,378
After that, Lord Sagi
who was so cheerful

165
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,380
turned into a totally different person,
became coldhearted

166
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,802
and he now conducts governmental
matters confined in his mansion...

167
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,179
From about that time,

168
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,516
the "Cursed Warrior" began appearing
in the castle town...

169
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:15,605
Those in the castle town say
that Lord Owashi was killed by someone...

170
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,024
There are even those who say
that the Cursed Warrior

171
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,777
is the ghost of Lord Owashi
searching for the person

172
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,240
who drove him to death and is attempting
to have his revenge...

173
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,450
That's scary...

174
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,204
There's no such thing as ghosts.

175
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:32,998
But...

176
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,709
That priest Moso is the one

177
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,586
who gained the most
from Owashi's death, huh...?

178
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,214
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
of virtue with no self-interests!

179
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,758
Then the suspicious one is...

180
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,928
The only one left is Komei the tactician!

181
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,930
I bet he assassinated Owashi

182
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,891
in an attempt to become
the feudal lord, but failed!

183
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,645
He has complained whenever
opportunity offered itself,

184
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,564
after Lord Sagi became
the feudal lord as well!

185
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,400
A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi
by starting the rumor

186
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,862
about the Cursed Warrior might be
a piece of cake for Lord Komei...!

187
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,073
All right! There's no doubt.

188
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,952
It's settled. The true identity of
the Cursed Warrior is Komei!

189
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,872
The true identity of the ghost
is revealed, huh...?

190
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,270
Lord Komei, there was nothing unusual
on the scheduled patrol.

191
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,402
You may step down...

192
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,695
Yes, sire.

193
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,045
Aren't we at our destination yet?!

194
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,423
Just a little further until
Lord Moso's residence.

195
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,806
Where is he?! This way?

196
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,725
Where did he go?!

197
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,144
Th-There he is!

198
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,147
Get him! Drag him down!

199
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,029
Cursed Warrior!

200
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:14,993
He vanished.

201
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,579
Lord Komei! Are you all right?!

202
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,001
I'm fine. Don't panic!

203
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,090
What's that?!

204
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,349
It's flying?!

205
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,315
Clad in white armor,
possesses a halberd,

206
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,943
and wears a mask with
a frightening look...

207
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,821
There's no doubt...
It's the Cursed Warrior!

208
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,406
After him!

209
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,327
Are you going to ride on
my shoulders forever?

210
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,539
Wait here! I'll pin down
the true identity of the ghost!

211
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,416
Huh? R-Right...

212
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,433
Where'd he go?!

213
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,810
Over there!

214
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,703
Byakugan!

215
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,506
I can't see him...

216
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,217
What does that mean?!

217
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,387
There's no human presence in here...

218
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,182
At least, a living presence...

219
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,978
Wh-Why do you put it that way...?

220
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,897
Shh! Didn't you hear
something just now?

221
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,326
I thought you didn't feel
a human presence!

222
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,580
I told you...living presence.

223
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,631
Wh-What do you want?!

224
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,550
Damn it, damn it.

225
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,927
You little!

226
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,599
Chain Weight!

227
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,742
Th-There can't be something like ghosts.
No such things as ghosts!

228
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,036
Stop, Naruto! He's...!

229
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,997
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

230
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,797
U! Zu! Ma! Ki!

231
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,928
Naruto Barrage!

232
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,113
Yes! Now I'll verify the true identity!

233
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,577
This is...

234
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,000
The insides are empty.

235
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,712
That means...

236
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:01,010
it's a real ghost!

237
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:22,740
So many things happen

238
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:28,371
on this endless road, huh?

239
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:34,168
Although you're strong-willed,

240
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:40,216
your voice wavered on the phone today

241
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,470
What dreams

242
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:51,102
did you chase to get here?

243
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:56,774
Even I have times when

244
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:03,364
I just don't understand, baby

245
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:08,911
When you're sad,

246
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:14,709
I'll be close to you

247
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:20,882
Even on nights when we're apart,

248
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:26,471
I'll be close to you

249
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:31,934
I'll be close to you

250
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,027
So that's Sagi,
the feudal lord of this land, huh?

251
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,821
He's far away,
but he might be quite cool.

252
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,074
Shh, be quiet!
What is it, Neji?

253
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,494
Something's strange.
What's with this blood thirst?

254
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,038
What? Bloodthirsty?
Could it be assassins?

255
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,250
They might be Shinobi.
Is everyone ready?!

256
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,376
– Yeah.
– Yeah.

257
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,296
I'll protect the feudal lord!

258
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,049
Next: "The Tactician's Intent."
