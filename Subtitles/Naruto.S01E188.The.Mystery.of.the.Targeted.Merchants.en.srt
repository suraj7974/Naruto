1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,928
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,195
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,325
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,498
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,901
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,780
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:18,496
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,639
Mystery of the Targeted Merchants

16
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,189
Did they really come this way?

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,274
But why come this way?

18
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,820
They shouldn't come this way
if it's as you say, Choji.

19
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:55,032
I said that because I didn't think
we were being targeted.

20
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,993
I don't think this is
the time to argue...

21
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,454
We have to formulate
some sort of strategy.

22
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,498
You say that, but...

23
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,666
What is it?

24
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,919
Have the guys
you spoke of caught up?

25
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,924
Then we should divide up
this group in two.

26
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,677
Here it's hard enough
to protect one.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,012
What's the point of dividing
the group in two?

28
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,430
N-Naruto!

29
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,685
Please, tell us what your idea is.

30
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,604
This is what I mean.

31
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,606
For example...

32
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,571
Let's say there are
ten persimmons here.

33
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,448
Is anything okay
if it's a food?

34
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,659
Yeah.

35
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,996
Then I want it to be ramen!

36
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,707
Naruto, it's an example, so...

37
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,834
Then we'll make it ramen.

38
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,170
Someone is after
these ten bowls of ramen.

39
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,382
And there are three people
to protect the ramen.

40
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,927
And so one person has
to protect roughly three bowls.

41
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,387
No, no. If it's ramen,

42
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,015
we should just eat it all
before they come.

43
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,725
That would settle things.

44
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:09,732
N-Naruto. This ramen is
for delivery to someone,

45
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,066
so we can't eat it.

46
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,987
Really? But the ramen
won't be tasty if it gets soggy.

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm moving on.

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,533
If three people protect
ten bowls of ramen,

49
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,286
one person protects
about three bowls.

50
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,747
But this ramen has
legs for escaping.

51
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,583
Ramen with legs for escaping?!

52
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,878
Five bowls of ramen
quick to escape...

53
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,467
and five bowls of ramen
slow to escape.

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,720
Right, right..
Things are kind of getting crazy.

55
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,098
I see. If we divide them
into two groups...

56
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,685
Of course, the pursuers would target
the group that is slow to escape first.

57
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,731
So we have one person
defend the preceding group

58
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,442
and two people
for the group that is slow to escape.

59
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,444
Right, right.

60
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,239
By doing this, as for protecting
the slow group,

61
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,159
now one person can just protect
two and a half bowls.

62
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,370
Oh!

63
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,290
In other words, the ramen that are
quick to escape are the young people

64
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:12,336
and the ramen that are slow to escape
are the elderly people and children, right?

65
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,837
Exactly.
Not only will the possibility

66
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,757
of the former to completely
get away increase,

67
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,385
the burden on the latter
to protect will decrease.

68
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,512
It's a strategy that kills two birds
with one stone.

69
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,682
You're smart.

70
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,143
However...
the elderly people and children will...

71
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,480
I just stated a rational idea.

72
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,898
There's the possibility

73
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,692
of complete annihilation
if we stay in a group.

74
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,110
Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?

75
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,695
Well...

76
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,241
Then it's settled.
Let's divide everyone up in two.

77
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,868
I'm sorry, gramps.

78
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,705
Don't worry about it.

79
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,875
It would be trouble if something bad
were to happen to the men in their prime.

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,671
You've got a wife and kid
at home, right?

81
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:00,968
Then we'll be going on
ahead first, Naruto, Choji.

82
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,303
Right.
We're counting on you, Hinata.

83
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,557
Naruto and I will deal
with the pursuers.

84
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,143
Right.
I'll protect them well.

85
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,863
Lady Haruna.

86
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,575
Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut.
What's your mission?

87
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,327
Is it not to protect me?

88
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,748
Things will be settled if Kikusuke
defeats those guys.

89
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,461
Then shall we get going, too?

90
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,629
I'm counting on you, Brother Choji.

91
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,424
Right!
Leave it to me!

92
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,592
Choji.

93
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,927
You go on ahead.

94
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,262
What?

95
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,516
I'm going back to check things out
at the place where the traps are.

96
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,686
But if you do that, you may encounter
the pursuers along the way...

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,021
That's fine.

98
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,691
Doing something like waiting
to be attacked isn't my style!

99
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,109
Naruto!

100
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,528
Leave it to me!

101
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,989
I meant...

102
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,616
There's no point to our strategy

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,035
if I have to protect five people
by myself.

104
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,454
Right, there's no point.

105
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,669
We came down that path,

106
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,297
so the trap should be
up ahead somewhere.

107
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,633
I guess I'll take a shortcut!

108
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,650
What's this?
What happened?

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,613
Why is it so wet?

110
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,252
What're these wounds?!

111
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,756
This guy's...!

112
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,184
Are you serious?

113
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,479
Is something wrong, Brother Choji?

114
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,232
No, nothing.

115
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,817
I see...

116
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,819
I feel it.

117
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,572
Even I can sense this much bloodlust.

118
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,198
It's close now.

119
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,076
Huh?

120
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,328
Rain?

121
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,292
This is the worst. Rain wipes out
all presence of the enemy.

122
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,754
Oh...

123
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,715
This rain is weird.

124
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,098
Gather around, everyone!

125
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,645
Stay close to me.

126
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,065
What's...this?

127
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,947
This is bad!

128
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,992
What was that now?!

129
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,120
Everyone! Get under the cart!

130
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,331
We're already under here!

131
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,082
You're quick!

132
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,834
Choji!

133
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,961
Naruto!

134
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,964
Get down!

135
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,758
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

136
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,528
Naruto! Could you say so
at the start

137
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,697
if you're going to
use paper bombs?

138
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,452
All right. It seems they're gone.

139
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,579
Why did they disappear?

140
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,540
Isn't it obvious?

141
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,710
They have no business with a shop
that doesn't have the thing they want.

142
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,964
Thing they want?
That's right.

143
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,299
If a shop's sold out
of the item you want,

144
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,677
you'd go to another shop, right?

145
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:17,140
Could it be that the thing that he wants
is in the other group?

146
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,143
What does that mean?!

147
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,188
Hinata's in danger!

148
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,733
Everyone, leave your stuff here
and take only what you need!

149
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,443
Hinata is?!

150
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,957
Everyone, we'll put up our tents here
for today and rest.

151
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,044
It's dangerous to move in the dark.

152
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,014
Hey!

153
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,019
We finally caught up.

154
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,566
Naruto, Choji. What is it?

155
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,903
"What is it," nothing.
The situation has changed.

156
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,781
It seems someone among
these people

157
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,783
is hiding something important.

158
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,287
Something important?

159
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:25,208
It should probably have something
to do with us being chased.

160
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,713
But who is hiding what?

161
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,176
It's most likely you guys,
Shun and Yurinoshin.

162
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,137
Don't be silly!
What're you saying we're hiding?

163
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,181
Don't play innocent!

164
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,101
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!

165
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,603
What?!

166
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,771
Kikusuke was?!

167
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,357
Don't play innocent!

168
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,527
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!

169
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,612
What?!

170
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,696
Kikusuke was?!

171
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,075
Why should he have to
suit up like a Shinobi,

172
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,078
fight those guys and then get killed?!

173
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,955
It's not necessary to tell you guys.

174
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,000
But if that's why we're being chased...

175
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,337
It means you guys are putting
everyone in danger.

176
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,631
If you don't tell us honestly,

177
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,800
we won't be able to protect
even what we can protect.

178
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,135
Kikunojou...

179
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,890
Kikunojou?

180
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,351
You mean Kikusuke?

181
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,814
Yes... And my name isn't Yurinoshin.
It's Yurinojou.

182
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,774
Stop, Yurinojou!

183
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,862
The person here is Lady Haruna,

184
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,783
the only daughter of the feudal lord
of the Land of Greens.

185
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,284
Princess?!

186
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:46,581
Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens.
You've grown up so much...

187
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,375
P-Princess...?

188
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,337
You were a woman?!

189
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,299
Lady Haruna,
it is as these people say.

190
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,303
We must not put everyone in danger
by hiding the truth any further.

191
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:07,477
But why is someone like a princess
mingling among merchants?

192
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,482
There was information of
a coup in the Land of Greens.

193
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,651
A coup?

194
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,947
The Land of Greens was a small,
but calm and peaceful land.

195
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,325
However, it was by no means
a prosperous land.

196
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,661
Before we realized it,

197
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,414
more than half of the public officials
had been bought off.

198
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,875
Who in the world would do that...?

199
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,211
The ringleaders are three brothers
called the Janin,

200
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,338
evil Ninja who came from
across the sea.

201
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,007
Janin?

202
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,718
Yes. They're guys who use
a particular type of Ninjutsu

203
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,971
and are called as such
because of their frightfulness.

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,518
They've taken many lives
and think nothing of it

205
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,687
if it's for their own gains.

206
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,940
They treat people like worms...

207
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,611
But why the Land of Greens?

208
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,155
I don't know why.

209
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,868
But his lordship had Lady Haruna
hide amongst a group of merchants

210
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,078
and got her out of the land.

211
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,541
Kikunojou and I were left
with the protection of the princess,

212
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,293
but we were insecure with
just the two of us.

213
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,422
So then we hurriedly commissioned
the Hidden Leaf

214
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,716
under the pretext of protection
from bandits.

215
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,220
Why didn't you tell us
something that important?

216
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,723
There's no way I could have.
My escape is top secret.

217
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,309
Besides, what would happen
if I were to have told you?

218
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,728
The end result would've been
you guys running away in confusion.

219
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,773
No way would I do something
like run away.

220
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,359
Kikunojou might not have
had to die if

221
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,737
we had understood the situation
from the start.

222
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,489
I wonder.

223
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:47,077
One of you guys might've ended up
like Kikunojou.

224
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,580
We're actually fine.

225
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,917
But to think you'd go so far as to involve
the old lady and the children.

226
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,710
It couldn't be!

227
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,004
Were you intending to use
the old lady and the kids as decoys

228
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,090
and escape just yourself?!

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,592
That's right. What of it?

230
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,263
Choji! Hinata!

231
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,518
As for me,
I'm really tickedoff right now!

232
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,270
So what of it?!

233
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,522
If something should happen
in the land,

234
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,774
I would become
the only blood relative

235
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
of the feudal lord of
the Land of Greens.

236
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,697
If I can just survive,
things could be restored someday,

237
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,491
even if the Land of Greens
were to be destroyed.

238
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,955
Say what?! Just what is it
you think of people's lives?!

239
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,759
Please forgive her.

240
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,970
Yurinojou.

241
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,349
Is it not your mission to protect me?

242
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,060
You're still talking about such things...?

243
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,438
Please wait, Naruto!

244
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,567
Lady Haruna, that's true for me.

245
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,278
However, these people are different.

246
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,906
The mission they undertook
was to protect merchants.

247
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,534
It was not to protect us.

248
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,705
Indeed, what we heard about

249
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,042
was a D-rank mission to protect
all of the merchants.

250
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:22,213
Protecting a prominent figure of
a land is an A-rank mission.

251
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,216
The rank differs by far too much.

252
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,178
Are you guys saying
you're going to forsake me?

253
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,014
Weren't you saying until just now

254
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,682
that you didn't trust people like us?

255
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,310
I'll protect you with my life,
Lady Haruna...

256
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,022
Shut up, Yurinojou!
Kikunojou was your senior disciple.

257
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,940
There's no way you alone
could defeat an opponent

258
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,151
whom he couldn't defeat!

259
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:48,740
That will just be our destiny
when that happens, Lady Haruna.

260
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,669
Watch, Brother Choji.

261
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,840
Oh! Awesome, awesome.

262
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,302
I'm sorry about earlier.

263
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,971
It happened so suddenly,
I couldn't stop.

264
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,517
Don't be concerned about me.

265
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,312
However, please forgive Lady Haruna.

266
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,315
The Land of Greens is a small land.

267
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,818
For the sake of the land's survival,

268
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,904
Lady Haruna was kept under
the custody of another land,

269
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,865
as a hostage all by herself
since she was little.

270
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,283
Hostage?

271
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,746
It frequently happens in
a small land in a war-torn world.

272
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,167
When Lady Haruna returned
from the other land,

273
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,379
she had completely lost her feelings
of trust towards people.

274
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,718
Lady Haruna is also
a victim of a turbulent world.

275
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,891
There's a village about one league down
the mountain from here.

276
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,353
For the time being, we'll leave
the old woman and the others there.

277
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,564
Be careful now.

278
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,482
You guys, too!

279
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,109
Bye!

280
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,237
Why are you separating them from us?

281
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,240
They still have value for
my personal use.

282
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,576
Are you still going on about that?

283
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,205
They went so far as to discard
their merchandise for your sake.

284
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,208
Then we should also leave this place.

285
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,460
We must not.

286
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,587
If we go into hiding,

287
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,548
there's a possibility of
that group being attacked again.

288
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,845
Exactly. This time,
it's our turn to be the decoy

289
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,263
in order to protect them.

290
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,266
Do as you like!

291
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,159
Hinata, I'll take care of things here.
Please rest a while.

292
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,578
Yeah, do that.

293
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,331
Th-Then, if you insist.

294
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,514
Oh, yeah. Here.
Kikunojou was holding this.

295
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,725
Thanks, Naruto.

296
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,648
Kikunojou was a master
of the Flower Ninjutsu

297
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,483
passed down in the Land of Greens.

298
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,444
We learned together
when we were little

299
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,447
and I couldn't beat him even once...

300
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,160
Now I have forever lost
the chance to beat him.

301
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,121
No... You still have a chance.

302
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,414
What?

303
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,293
If you beat the guy
who defeated Kikunojou,

304
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,879
you will have beaten Kikunojou!

305
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,007
Naruto... You're exactly right...!

306
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,384
Here they come!

307
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,887
Other than the fact that
the enemy uses water,

308
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,348
we have absolutely no idea
what they'll come at us with.

309
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,225
I know.

310
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,354
Go! Flower Ninja Art:!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.

311
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,741
What?!

312
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,411
He changed the trajectory in mid-air?!

313
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,042
Oh, no!

314
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,795
I finally got you!

315
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,673
Gotcha.

316
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,759
To think you'd
make me look like a fool.

317
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,596
So you finally show yourself.

318
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,849
I will avenge Kikunojou!

319
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,477
Try it if you can.

320
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,860
I won't let you get away!

321
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,538
Too bad. You're one person short.

322
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,666
I've set a share for one more.

323
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,254
I don't know about that.

324
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,687
First, I'll take care of you, boy.

325
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,357
Water Style: Liquid Memory!

326
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,028
Naruto...!

327
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,489
And this!

328
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,993
Summoning Jutsu!

329
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,415
What is it?

330
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,875
Is that...?

331
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,336
The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!

332
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,299
Vanish and die!

333
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:16,275
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

334
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:23,241
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

335
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,631
Yellow Moon.

336
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:45,513
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

337
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:50,852
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

338
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:57,734
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

339
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:04,657
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

340
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:11,372
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

341
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:18,004
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

342
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,969
A magical chord change, in a restless city

343
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,851
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

344
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,817
What is this huge thing?

345
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,819
I don't wanna become its food.

346
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,488
Let me tell you one thing.
I'm not tasty.

347
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,655
I'm not tasty, either.

348
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,199
But Choji would be more
worthwhile to eat.

349
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,201
No, Naruto would be tastier.

350
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,702
Be eaten for the sake of your comrade.

351
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,370
You're the one who will
become it food.

352
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,414
This isn't the time to be arguing
about stuff like that.

353
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,707
Yurinojou!

354
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,003
Anyway, we just have to run
with all our might for now!

355
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,964
Next time:
"A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools"
