1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,894
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,994
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,498
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,260
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,932
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,237
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,077
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,167
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,129
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,906
It looks like you've got some time
to kill there all by yourself.

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,078
What happened to the blond boy
and that stuck-up boy?

22
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,664
They're in the middle of
the tree-climbing training.

23
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,082
You don't have to do that?

24
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,837
I'm exceptional, so Kakashi Sensei
told me to guard you.

25
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,715
Really?

26
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,175
What?!

27
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,971
You got a minute, Tazuna?

28
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,849
Huh? What's up, Giichi?

29
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,351
Uh, actually...

30
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,728
I gave it a lot of thought.

31
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,566
Building this bridge...
will you let me quit?

32
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,320
Why so suddenly? Not you too?!

33
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:37,241
Tazuna, I've had a bond
with you from the old days.

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,451
I'd like to cooperate,
but if we push it too far,

35
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,037
Gato will set his sights on us, too.

36
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:48,794
Also...if you get killed,
everything is lost!

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,508
Why don't you just
stop building the bridge?

38
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,140
Not a chance...

39
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,894
This is our bridge.

40
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,397
This is the bridge that
everyone in town has built

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,609
believing that it would generate
distribution and transportation

42
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,111
for this poor Land of Waves
that has few resources.

43
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,072
But if it goes so far as
to take our lives...

44
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,575
It's already afternoon...

45
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,410
Let's call it a day.

46
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,663
Tazuna!

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,792
Giichi...you don't have to
come back tomorrow.

48
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,968
The Land Where a Hero Once Lived

49
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,766
Damn it!

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,729
What the heck is up with this?

51
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,623
I won't lose to you!

52
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,808
Say, where are we going?

53
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,478
I was asked to get some ingredients
for dinner on the way home...

54
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,939
WILL DO ANY KIND OF WORK

55
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,482
Thief!

56
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,533
What's up with...this town...?

57
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,827
We're here...

58
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,829
Welcome...

59
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,466
There's hardly anything here...

60
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,892
You pervert!!

61
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,854
You're...wrong...

62
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,985
Man, I was really surprised earlier.

63
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,945
What's going on with this town?!

64
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,157
Again?

65
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,075
Hey, you...

66
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,496
What...?

67
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,832
Gimme some!

68
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,429
Oh... Here...

69
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,598
Yaaay!

70
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,100
Thank you.

71
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,691
This is how it's been ever
since Gato showed up.

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,987
Here, all the adults
have turned into cowards.

73
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,872
So that's why now
that bridge is necessary...

74
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,249
It's a symbol of bravery...

75
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,753
in order to restore their spirit,
so they don't keep running away...

76
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,254
For the people of this land...

77
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,256
who have set their minds
on remaining passive...

78
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:29,056
If we can just... complete that bridge...

79
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,061
this town will return to how it once was...

80
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,772
and everyone will come back.

81
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,283
Sasuke...Naruto...

82
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,177
Damn it! Damn it!

83
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,972
Are you telling me that
Sasuke's still climbing?!

84
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,354
Darn it... He's gradually catching up...

85
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,068
Darn it! No! No!

86
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,531
If I let myself get distracted by Sasuke,
my concentration will be disturbed!

87
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,495
Hey Sakura, can you give me some tips?

88
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,788
Huh?

89
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,291
Without telling Sasuke, okay, okay?

90
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:45,591
Listen. Chakra uses spiritual energy,
so you mustn't get too strained or frantic.

91
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,719
Relax and concentrate on the tree
so that you can constantly accumulate

92
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,263
a fixed amount of Chakra
in the bottom of your feet.

93
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,891
Concentrate! Concentrate!

94
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,435
Okay. I'm getting good vibes, I say!

95
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,437
Okay! This is it!

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,771
Hey...Naruto!

97
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,985
Jeez, what the heck's wrong with you?!

98
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,112
Don't interfere while
I'm trying to concentrate!

99
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,074
U...Uh...Well...

100
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,368
W-What is it?!

101
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,623
I'm not used to him speaking to me first...

102
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,796
Y-You asked Sakura to give
you some tips before...

103
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,840
What did she say to you...?

104
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,055
I'm not telling!

105
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,615
Man... This is really fun!

106
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,826
It's been a long time since we've had
a meal with this many people!

107
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,542
Seconds please!

108
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,425
Stop eating if you're going to vomit!

109
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,886
No, I'll eat.

110
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,597
I have to eat even if it means enduring.

111
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,600
I have to get strong
as quickly as possible, so...

112
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,560
Yes-yes!

113
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,646
But vomiting is different.

114
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,240
Excuse me, why is there
a torn picture hanging here?

115
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,327
Inari was looking at this
all through dinner.

116
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:42,416
This torn part looks like someone who was
in the picture was deliberately torn off.

117
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,839
It's my husband...

118
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,927
He's a man who was
once called a hero of this town...

119
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,433
Inari! Where are you going...?

120
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:07,691
Dad!

121
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm always telling you not to
talk about that person in front of Inari...!

122
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,833
What're you saying happened with Inari?

123
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,545
It appears there's
some kind of good reason.

124
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,842
Inari had a father not related by blood...

125
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:38,305
It was like they were a real father
and son who got along really well...

126
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,478
Back then, Inari was a child
who laughed all the time...

127
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,689
However...

128
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,322
However...

129
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:02,496
Inari has changed...
ever since that incident with his father.

130
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,628
The word bravery was eternally taken

131
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:14,549
from the people of this island
and from Inari...

132
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,469
With that day,
that incident, as the trigger.

133
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,681
That incident? What happened to Inari?

134
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,811
To explain the incident, I must first...

135
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:31,066
tell you about the man
who was called the hero of this land.

136
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,609
Hero...?

137
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,404
It was around three years ago...

138
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,657
when Inari met the man...

139
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,620
Potchi!! Potchi!!

140
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,126
Wrong! His name's Shooting Star...

141
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,294
As of today, he's my dog!

142
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,840
He's not Shooting Star!
He's my Potchi! Give him back!

143
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,925
Potchi's my friend!

144
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,261
Who's going to give him
to the likes of you?!

145
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,389
Shut up!

146
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,230
Potchi!!

147
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,902
That's cuz you wouldn't
hand him over quietly...

148
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,655
Now I couldn't care less about that dog!

149
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,866
Hey, let him go!

150
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,829
What have you done?!
Are you trying to kill Potchi?!

151
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,458
Heh! He's your special mutt, right?

152
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,293
Then save him, quick.

153
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,921
What's the matter...?

154
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,257
Is it okay with you if he dies?!

155
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,308
Of course I'm not okay with him dying!

156
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,144
He's my only friend!

157
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,646
– But...
– Look. He can't even dog paddle

158
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,107
– even though he's a dog!
– But...

159
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,403
I'm sorry, Potchi... I can't swim...

160
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:02,491
Hey! If you're his owner,
dive in after him!

161
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,627
This is bad, Akane.
What if he can't swim...?

162
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,588
S-Save me...!

163
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,215
Leave him be.

164
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,925
B-But...

165
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,513
Then why don't you go
save him if you like?

166
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,518
I-I don't want to die... Somebody save me...!

167
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,897
P-Potchi!

168
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,149
Potchi!

169
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,485
I'm gonna digress, but...

170
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,780
Potchi learned how to dog paddle then.

171
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,743
Potchi!

172
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,877
Shooting Star escaped. Get him!

173
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,685
Ohhh...I can't breathe... This...is it...

174
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,569
Are you awake, boy?

175
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,160
I gave those kids a good scolding.

176
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,870
Here, eat!

177
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,499
Is this God? Oh...

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,377
Did you...save me?

179
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,089
Just eat! Start with that.

180
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,635
I see. You were betrayed by your dog, too...

181
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:50,557
In my country, dogs are creatures
that have a keen sense of loyalty...

182
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,893
Well, you betrayed your dog's trust first,

183
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,645
so there's nothing you can do about that.

184
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,858
I was scared and couldn't move.

185
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,112
I wanted to save him...

186
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,616
But...I have no guts, so...

187
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,117
That's right.

188
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,204
Of course a kid your age would be scared.

189
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,166
But you know...boy.

190
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,627
Just remember this.

191
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,128
Huh?

192
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,340
If you're a man choose
a lifestyle you won't regret...

193
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,261
For things I truly hold dear to myself,

194
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,765
I'll protect them until the very end
with both these arms.

195
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,893
Even if it's tough, or sad,
I'll stick it out...

196
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,729
even if it looks like
I might lose my life!

197
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,985
His name was Kaiza and

198
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:48,657
he was a fisherman who'd come to this land
from another country in search of his dreams.

199
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,869
After that, Inari really took to Kaiza.

200
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,164
It may have been because Inari
had lost his real father

201
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,667
when he was too young
to remember anything.

202
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,336
But he was very attached to Kaiza.

203
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,129
They were like father and son...

204
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,592
It didn't take long for Kaiza to become...

205
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,969
a member of the family.

206
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,850
And he was a man this town needed.

207
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,645
We...we've got trouble, Kaiza!

208
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,272
The river dam has broken from this rain!

209
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,900
At this rate, District D will be consumed!

210
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,902
What?!
Dad!

211
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,154
Inari, go out back and get some rope!
Okay!

212
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,407
Its no good!

213
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,200
The only thing we can do is
to attach a rope and pull...

214
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,370
Don't talk nonsense!
How are we going to attach a rope?!

215
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,456
We'd die if we were to go
into such a furious current!

216
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,668
But if we drag our feet,
District D will be annihilated!

217
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,211
What should we do...?

218
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,295
I'll do it.

219
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,382
Kaiza!

220
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,300
Don't be foolish!

221
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,386
Even you wouldn't be able to!

222
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,096
Dad!

223
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,472
Don't worry...

224
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,599
Your dad's unmatched.

225
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,562
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so...

226
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,986
For things I truly hold dear to myself...

227
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,621
Even if I lose my life...

228
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,753
I'll protect them to the end...
with both these arms!

229
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,174
Dad, hang in there!

230
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,809
He did it! The rope...the rope's attached!

231
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,686
Okay, everybody pull!

232
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,062
Yeah!

233
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:48,067
From then on...the people of this land
called Kaiza a hero.

234
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:52,572
And he became a father
that Inari could be proud of.

235
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,786
It was around that time when Gato
set his sights on this land.

236
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,538
And then, one night...

237
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,804
I heard...

238
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,182
That you're going to protect
this town with those arms...

239
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,483
I dare you to!

240
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,765
Listen up!

241
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,353
This man resisted through force,
the policies of the Gato corporation

242
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,438
and disturbed the order of this nation.

243
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,650
Therefore, he will now be executed!

244
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,578
I just hope that such trivial matters
will never occur again.

245
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,204
Dad!

246
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,539
Stop, Inari...

247
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,631
Do it...

248
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,636
Dad...

249
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,185
Dad!

250
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,195
Didn't you tell me...?

251
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,161
That you'd...protect...

252
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,753
me and the people of this land...
with both your arms...?

253
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,423
Dad, you liar...

254
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,597
Ever since then, Inari has changed...

255
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,142
as well as Tsunami... and the townspeople...

256
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,609
Hero, that's just stupid.
There's no such thing!

257
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,295
What're you doing, Naruto...?

258
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,299
You've had enough training for today.
You've built up too much Chakra.

259
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,635
You'll die if you move any more than that.

260
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,012
I'll prove it.

261
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,848
Prove what?

262
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,435
I'll prove that...

263
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,772
there are heroes...

264
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,819
in this world!

265
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,208
Huh? What do you want, lady?

266
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,793
As for me, I'm training right now.

267
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,669
Cuz we don't know when
Zabuza will strike next..

268
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,924
Getting strong for someone special
is something I understand very well.

269
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,927
So I'm going to get stronger and stronger.

270
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll show Inari that there are heroes
in this world.

271
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,976
Next time:
"Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!"

272
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,687
As for me, I'm going to
kick butt once again!
