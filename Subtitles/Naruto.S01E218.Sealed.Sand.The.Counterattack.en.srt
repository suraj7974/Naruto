1
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,636
To think the Leaf's reinforcements
will be you of all people!

2
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,517
A man should always repay
the debt he owes a woman.

3
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:20,730
Always the bothersome guy with
the man and woman stuff!

4
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:25,693
Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after
the guys who took our village girl.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,903
Forget about here and
head for them!

6
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,905
We've received information.

7
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,908
Gaara and Kankuro have entered
their respective battles.

8
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,202
I see...

9
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,831
The shadow won't reach, I guess...

10
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,419
Leaf Village's two-man cells are
just now heading there for back-up.

11
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,464
How well prepared.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,466
It's a pain,

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,468
but as long as we're doing this,
we'll do it right.

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,888
We'll do it perfectly without
producing casualties!

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,017
Make sure you don't cry
in front of me this time.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,812
Are you going to hold
that over my head forever?

17
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,814
Just like a woman...

18
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,819
I-I feel like I don't really
have my place in this.

19
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,322
I'll take care of all of you at once!

20
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,451
Here it comes!

21
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:22,875
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

22
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:29,590
into your hands

23
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:48,317
The distance created between us
became too big,

24
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,907
because we were always together

25
00:01:55,491 --> 00:02:01,121
Your honest reply, "See you..."

26
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:07,002
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

27
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:13,259
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

28
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,971
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

29
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,349
even if I'm not by your side

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:26,564
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

31
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:33,112
into your hands

32
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:38,742
I can feel it so close,

33
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:44,707
Our two hearts

34
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,547
Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!

35
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,592
To think you'd ask
the Leaf Village for help...

36
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,012
I guess the Sand has lost the edge
they used to have, huh?

37
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,805
Why are you here?

38
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,561
You know, dogs.

39
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,773
They're not satisfied until a favor
has been properly returned.

40
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,817
Especially this Akamaru!

41
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,114
A dog retuning a favor doesn't
have much of a ring to it!

42
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:21,076
Help is on the way to
the other two as well.

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,662
You concentrate on this fight!

44
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,457
You're giving me lip!

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,293
So you flies are gonna gang up
on me, huh?

46
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,922
But you're no match for my Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

47
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,006
Eat this!

48
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:49,605
If your Chakra isn't built up,
your sand is no big deal at all!

49
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,815
It'll only be useful for
blinding me at best!

50
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,152
It's futile!

51
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:01,116
I feel it.
Your Chakra is being sucked up.

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,332
What?! He was setting the sand
in the gourd aside?!

53
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,102
I was being cautious,
but he is much too strong.

54
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,022
Gaara Sensei!

55
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,969
Just what I'd expect from
Gaara of the Sand.

56
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,264
He's not called the ultimate weapon
for nothing...

57
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,309
The ultimate...weapon?!

58
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,728
However, he cannot exceed
our Ninja tools

59
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,773
forged in the Village of the Artisans!

60
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,363
Gaara!

61
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,118
Hey, he's totally got the edge!

62
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,037
Do we have a chance to
return the favor?

63
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,672
That's incredible wind.
What an amount of Chakra...

64
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:25,511
No, it seems that sword is
amplifying her Chakra.

65
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,931
So she's relying on that sword for
all of her attack and defense, huh?

66
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,603
Anyway, we've got to slip within
firing range for our Jutsu

67
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,688
and stop her movements!

68
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,856
Right.

69
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,858
Let's go at once!

70
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,906
Annoying!

71
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,588
She's attempting to maintain
her distance just from Temari.

72
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,342
I see.

73
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,137
So she just wants to pay attention
to the long range-type Temari and

74
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,931
blow us mid-range Jutsu users
away with wind

75
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,766
before we can get close, huh...?

76
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,310
Now then, what should we do?

77
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,106
Man Beast Clone!

78
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,025
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
75.0101:07:33:1001:07:34:03Crow!

79
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,779
– Arms!
– Fang Over Fang!

80
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,453
Did you guys come to
get in my way?!

81
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,081
We made sure to send you
a signal, right?!

82
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,958
How could I tell?!

83
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,335
We don't click at all?

84
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,213
Are you guys...messing around?!

85
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,048
Be more serious and die!

86
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,551
Talking nonsense!

87
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,463
Although I reduced the damage
with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still...

88
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,930
Just what I'd expect of Gaara,

89
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,350
the Sand's ultimate weapon
who hosts the Shukaku...

90
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,901
But you're already in our hands.

91
00:08:55,911 --> 00:09:00,040
What should I do?
She's beyond the range of my Jutsu...

92
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:05,003
and I don't see anything around here
that could be used to extend my shadow.

93
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,301
Hey!

94
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,559
What're you whispering about?

95
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,480
What're you thinking?!

96
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,567
I'll explain later, for crying out loud.
Can you do it or not?

97
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,528
I suppose I could try, but...

98
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,909
What is it...?

99
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,837
What's he doing?

100
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:00,267
Behold the terror of Ninja tools
our village created.

101
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,716
What's this Chakra?

102
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,026
This is a water vein!

103
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:52,986
I get it!

104
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,074
The lines connecting the point
in the center and triangle isn't a Barrier...

105
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,283
It's a water vein!

106
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,204
Ninja Tool Barrier:
Reverse Scale Formation... Activate!

107
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,268
Oh no!

108
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,814
Gaara Sensei!

109
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,444
The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation
was a single point, Gaara from the start!

110
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,447
Our swords accurately pierce
a water vein

111
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,282
and summon the water dragon.

112
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,493
Sand has sucked up
a large amount of water

113
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,286
and has become as heavy as lead...

114
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,331
Now Gaara can no longer use sand.

115
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,751
Gaara!

116
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,628
– Gaara!
– Calm down!

117
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,589
Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!

118
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,841
That guy is?!

119
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,177
They'll save Gaara,
no matter what.

120
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,472
We need to concentrate on
the enemy in front of us.

121
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,777
To think you'd choose
a sandy area to fall on...

122
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,155
Just what I'd expect of Gaara
of the desert...

123
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,533
However!

124
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,167
That's as far as
your useless resistance goes!

125
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,127
Leaf Hurricane!

126
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,925
A hero's turn always comes late!

127
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,429
That's right!

128
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,517
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!

129
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,478
Naruto...!

130
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,356
It seems you rushed to everyone
during the Sasuke incident...

131
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,485
This time we've come to return
the favor from that time.

132
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,613
So we'll take that guy on!

133
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,824
You hurry to your student straight on!

134
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,831
To think he'd corner you this far...

135
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,543
– Lee!
– Sakura!

136
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:18,298
Leave Gaara's treatment to me!
Lee, you go with Naruto!

137
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,884
– Sakura!
– Got it!

138
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,556
Then I'll be going first!

139
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,935
Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!

140
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,564
I'll suck up all of your Chakra!

141
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,782
I see. So this means we can't
release our regular power?

142
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,492
That doesn't matter!

143
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,411
Even without Chakra,
we've got fighting spirit!

144
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,999
Yes! We'll go with that
plus willpower!

145
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,008
Just as I thought.

146
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,637
That they haven't launched anything
during the fight thus far means

147
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,807
the two reinforcements don't
have long range-type Jutsu.

148
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,518
Then I'll maintain this distance and...

149
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,979
you'll die getting torn up by the wind!

150
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,900
While she's distracted by Shikamaru
and the others,

151
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,652
I'll just go for it!

152
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,487
Mind Destruction...!

153
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,657
Ino!

154
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,369
Foolish girl. It's useless to attempt
to exploit an opening!

155
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,870
You little!

156
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:41,172
You won't get close to me!
I've read your range as well!

157
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,383
I don't know about that...!

158
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,177
Ino! You stay right there!

159
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,808
I'm counting on you...!

160
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,560
Shino! Sakura!

161
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,359
There's one wounded
at the waterfall.

162
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,611
Tunneling Fang!

163
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,782
Now!
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

164
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,745
Oh...!
What're you doing?!

165
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,290
Are you guys...mocking me?

166
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,753
After sucking up all of your Chakra,
I'll be returning the favor plenty!

167
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,134
The contusion treatment is complete.

168
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,679
But, the depletion of Chakra
is overwhelming.

169
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,811
Contact from your friends...?

170
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,022
– Ino's hurt?!
– Go!

171
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,233
Wha...?! But in your condition...

172
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,322
I'm okay now. Help your friend!

173
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,825
Okay. Don't push yourself.

174
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:51,910
Yeah...

175
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:01,044
What're you doing?!
Hurry up and go after your comrade!

176
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,879
I'll help my comrade.

177
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,173
I'll settle this in a moment.

178
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,341
But...

179
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,052
Bushy Brow!

180
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,560
Damn it. It's no good
just shot-gunning it!

181
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,438
It's just him?

182
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,654
A part of Black Ant...

183
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,116
Could it be...a signal?

184
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,284
Fang Over Fang once more!

185
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,287
Back me up with Crow!

186
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,998
I'm counting on you
for back up too, Choji!

187
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,250
Got it!

188
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,545
Heh! Bossing me around.

189
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,386
The counterattack starts now!

190
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,140
It's futile. Your Jutsu won't reach me!

191
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,601
You never know until you try, right...?!

192
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,728
Here we go!

193
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,688
Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!

194
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,274
Huh?!

195
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,611
What're you aiming at?!
Totally misguided...

196
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,573
Say what?

197
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,408
What's the meaning of this?

198
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm sure I'd read your range already...!

199
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,329
I'll show you!

200
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,211
I can create a shadow with
this thick a current

201
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,379
even if the water's clear.

202
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:32,302
My Jutsu's range has infinitely
improved by lifting the waterfall!

203
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,389
The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success!

204
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,517
Summoning...

205
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,186
Blade Dance!

206
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,661
This one's done!

207
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,916
Good grief...

208
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,005
I...couldn't do anything.

209
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,758
Here everyone's doing their best...

210
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,885
Only I...

211
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,346
Ino?

212
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:18,890
Gaara.

213
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,815
You don't have any sand
left you can use.

214
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,069
What's this?!

215
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,737
He smashed the Sand Armor.

216
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,784
No way! But the sand
heavy with water like that...

217
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,869
If I just suck up the Chakra...

218
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,332
This is my weapon!

219
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,642
You okay, Gaara?!

220
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,602
This is the finishing blow...

221
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,355
Gaara Sensei!

222
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,066
Hurry! Leave the rest to us!

223
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,279
Man Beast Clone!

224
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,363
Fang Over Fang!

225
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,407
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

226
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,327
Annoying buzzing flies!

227
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,621
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!

228
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,839
What?!

229
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,215
Oh, no!

230
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,428
Puppet Show...

231
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,267
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

232
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,194
The show's over!

233
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,946
– We did it!
– Yeah!

234
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,202
Matsuri.

235
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,834
Gaara and...!

236
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,629
A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.

237
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,881
He's heading for the valley.

238
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,925
The last one...

239
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,218
Gaara is chasing him!

240
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,303
What?!

241
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,811
You okay, Bushy Brow?
Sakura will be right back.

242
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,896
Thanks.

243
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,023
Well, I'm going after Gaara!

244
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,651
Got it! I'll meet up with you later!

245
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,162
I've got him cornered.

246
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,552
Matsuri.

247
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,144
The Key to the rusted heart's door

248
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:16,317
Will always be smiling right near by

249
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,285
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

250
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

251
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,628
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

252
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,550
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

253
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,346
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

254
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,018
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

255
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:54,230
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

256
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:01,279
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

257
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,783
The wind is probably testing our hearts

258
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:10,663
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

259
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:15,084
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

260
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:20,173
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

261
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

262
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,600
Will always be smiling right near by

263
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,233
I heard you figured out the identities
of the Four Celestials?

264
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,153
Yes. They are the Ninja of
the Village of the Artisans

265
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,696
who've been harboring ill feeling
toward the Five Great Nations.

266
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,199
It seems they've completed
the forbidden project

267
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,533
passed down in the village and

268
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,619
intend to resurrect
their ultimate weapon.

269
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,623
I see. I take it the other villagers
got wind of it and evacuated.

270
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,626
Exactly. You head over to
where they are immediately.

271
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,794
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,297
Next time:
"The Ultimate Weapon Reborn"
