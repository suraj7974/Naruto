1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,817
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,320
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,290
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,258
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,720
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,183
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,686
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:11,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,784
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,924
and melting away

17
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,647
I'll let you out of here.

18
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,692
And I'll grant you one wish, too.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,736
You don't have to worry.

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,116
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.

21
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,703
It's not like you'll lose everything.

22
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,169
Now then, your flesh is mine.

23
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,096
With this, Lord Orochimaru's body
has once again

24
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,640
become unable to reanimate
for several years.

25
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,601
However there's a next time...

26
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:32,027
I-Indeed. My body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.

27
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,699
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything...

28
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,494
to find my own calling.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,956
I've finally understood that.

30
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,461
Even if it's not me...

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:54,925
I'll bring in the new "vessel,"
even if it costs me my life.

32
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,513
That's my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru.

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,061
That's the only redemption for me...
who was worthless.

34
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,817
Miscalculation: A New Enemy Appears!

35
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,581
They're fast.

36
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,090
Akamaru.

37
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,260
Come quick after you've set the bombs!

38
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,105
Oh no!

39
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,528
All right.
Great.

40
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,489
Akamaru, well done.

41
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,133
Messing with me.

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,220
Akamaru.

43
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,681
Don't you "arf" me, you mutt!

44
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,686
I'll waste you.

45
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,026
Hold on.

46
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,653
You!

47
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,669
Kiba! Akamaru!

48
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,837
Damn it.

49
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,614
What's happening?

50
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:26,243
You punks!

51
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,620
Where are Kiba and Akamaru?!

52
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,456
Another one's come.

53
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,625
We have no choice.

54
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,963
I'll take care of this, so you take
the coffin and go on ahead.

55
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,089
Shikamaru...

56
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,924
Get going already.

57
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,559
Wh-Why are you...?

58
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,931
I'm sorry, Naruto.
It's my miscalculation.

59
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,434
Kimimaro.

60
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,446
You were taking too long, Tayuya.

61
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:51,370
And what happened to
the other three?

62
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,165
Being none other than those
of the former "Sound Ninja Five."

63
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,586
Why are you...?

64
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,091
Your body... Your body's no longer...

65
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:11,807
I'm not moving with the flesh anymore.
It's mental power.

66
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,811
Man, you cheater of death...

67
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,940
I understand a little now,
that feeling...

68
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:25,279
of being information that has escaped
from the prison of the flesh.

69
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,747
The feeling of experiencing
a taste of Lord Orochimaru's dream.

70
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,209
Orochimaru...!

71
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,255
This vessel...is an important vessel
for the dream...

72
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,634
The flesh that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

73
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,762
But you guys were a bit too late.

74
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,312
Some dangerous guy
has appeared again.

75
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,440
That air about him is
nothing ordinary.

76
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,819
Anyway, we need
to sort out the situation.

77
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,237
If we were to carelessly
plunge in...

78
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,783
You jerk.
What're you babbling nonsense?

79
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,910
Naruto!

80
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,703
Give back Sasuke!

81
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,371
Hey, wait!

82
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,349
Tayuya.

83
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,395
The reason why I won't kill you now

84
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,275
is because you have a mission
you have to complete.

85
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:51,281
And my mission is to deliver
that to Lord Orochimaru.

86
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,076
Isn't it too late now?

87
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,454
Humph. I told you.

88
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,625
That's the body that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

89
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,002
The next vessel, huh?

90
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,464
That's right...

91
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,426
And this is the only thing that
I can do at present.

92
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,890
I leave those two pieces
of garbage to you.

93
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,147
Sasuke...

94
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,358
That punk!

95
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,567
Calm down, Naruto.

96
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,486
How can I calm down?

97
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,822
At this rate,
Sasuke will get far away again.

98
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,161
Naruto's right.

99
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,956
This is a mission to bring Sasuke back
to the Leaf Village.

100
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,002
We must choose what would be
the most rational means

101
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,837
to execute the mission.

102
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,897
Damned punks.

103
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,524
I'll finish this in a flash.

104
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,236
Naruto, listen up.

105
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,823
Please move according to the plan
that I'm going to tell you.

106
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,917
He's a classic close-range
combat-type fool

107
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,545
with Shadow Clone Jutsu
as his only saving grace.

108
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,964
And he's a middle-range
combat type

109
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,634
who binds his enemies with
a Jutsu using shadows...

110
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,054
and a sharp squad leader, huh?

111
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,268
Got it?
Yeah.

112
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,188
Come on already, you punks.

113
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,109
It's two versus one.
We've got the upper hand.

114
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,403
It's an opponent we can beat
if we team up.

115
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,655
Let's go, Naruto.
All right.

116
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,408
With garbage like you jerks,

117
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,619
it doesn't matter how many
of you are there.

118
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,455
Don't underestimate our teamwork.

119
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,790
Let's go!

120
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,212
Bring it.

121
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,508
Now...Naruto.

122
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,510
I'll blow you away.

123
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,353
Gotcha. The strategy is a success.

124
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,897
Farewell.

125
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,613
Blast.
You tricked me.

126
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,075
Teamwork, my foot. You little punks...

127
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,333
Blast.

128
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,799
You wouldn't fall for the same trick
over and over, huh..?

129
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,261
Small fry... You've got nerve.

130
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,266
Well, I guess I'll settle for just
having been able to let him get away.

131
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,852
Remember this.

132
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,187
It's not just Jutsu that are weapons.

133
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,485
I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.

134
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,121
Hang in there, Sasuke.

135
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,339
But that kid,

136
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,759
how wonderful it is that
he can move with that body, eh?

137
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,931
Kabuto, I don't know what kind
of order you gave him,

138
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,850
but it's a bit harsh.

139
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,812
Not at all.
It wasn't an order.

140
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:55,025
I don't like to force things.

141
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,361
He acted on his own.

142
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,366
For you whom he reveres.

143
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,332
Kabuto...You've really got
a hateful personality, don't you?

144
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,334
Lord Orochimaru.

145
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,297
To you,
Kimimaro was a perfect existence...

146
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,968
His thoughts were steeped in darkness
in the same way as yours.

147
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,803
And he sanctified you.

148
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,390
And he fanatically admired
and revered you.

149
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:34,397
Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan
with the strongest and perfect bodies

150
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,946
being the legitimate bloodline
of their Kekkai Genkai...

151
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,697
until a short time ago.

152
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,574
Yes...

153
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,538
When I think about having lost him,
I still get a chill down my spine.

154
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,249
I think about it even now...

155
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,752
The man I truly wished for...

156
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:00,340
The body I wanted the most...Kimimaro.

157
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,928
And if only he hadn't been stricken
with disease,

158
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,806
the assassination of the Hokage
would've gone smoother.

159
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,599
Seal!

160
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,319
My arms...

161
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,824
Now...you can no longer use
either of your arms...

162
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,743
And since you can't use your arms,

163
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,912
you can't weave Sign...

164
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,582
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!

165
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,548
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf...dies right here!

166
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,635
Orochimaru, you fool...

167
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:51,808
It's unfortunate that we can't leave
together but, my disciple...

168
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,145
Let's meet in the other world
one day...

169
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,638
Sasuke...
Sasuke's not here yet?

170
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,227
We wouldn't have needed to go
through such an experience.

171
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:44,569
In the world, very often things don't go
as we want them to.

172
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:53,036
It's only a matter of time,
Lord Orochimaru.

173
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:10,387
When Tayuya...comes back,
I'll kill her.

174
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,223
Hold it.

175
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,309
Hey...!

176
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,198
Now then, how shall I defeat you?

177
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,464
You...

178
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,300
Those eyes...

179
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,972
It seems he possesses
a peculiar Chakra.

180
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,019
What does Orochimaru want to do...?
Why's he after Sasuke?

181
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,698
Lord Orochimaru has already
obtained Immortality Jutsu...

182
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:18,413
A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu
and obtain everything in the world.

183
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,333
What does that have to do
with Sasuke?!

184
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:27,422
"Immortal" doesn't mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is...

185
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,550
Before his body decays,

186
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,387
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.

187
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,848
That's...

188
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,309
Are you saying that's Sasuke?!

189
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,772
Yes... That's right.

190
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,777
I won't let such a thing happen!

191
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:55,033
Idiot... What will come of sending
one shrimp punk in pursuit?

192
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,454
And looking at things
in terms of time,

193
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,915
up until now you probably sacrificed
one member each time

194
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,959
in order for the group
to move forward.

195
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,925
Is that guy called Sasuke
that important?

196
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,430
How many of your men do you intend
to sacrifice for the sake of just one person?

197
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,849
You incompetent punk.

198
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,897
Heh... Indeed...

199
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:31,694
For me, this is my first mission
as a platoon leader.

200
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:36,366
It's very disquieting having
comrades gradually whittled down,

201
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,328
and I didn't know if my own judgments
were correct or not.

202
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,585
As a squad leader with
the lives of the party in my hands...

203
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,463
respecting the lives in
the four-member party,

204
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,758
rather than the life of one person
taken by the enemy...

205
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,721
and deciding to abort a mission
that's too dangerous, would be by the book.

206
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,683
Then, why didn't you do that?

207
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,855
The world doesn't go
by the book very often...

208
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,653
Since not one person in my squad
would do something like

209
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:18,491
abandon a captured comrade
and give up fighting

210
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,160
for the sake of their own safety.

211
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,622
Me included.

212
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,671
Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,

213
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,550
I am not cut out to be a squad leader
who gives orders to comrades.

214
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,554
The only thing I can do for them...

215
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,017
is to have faith in them.

216
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,897
Listen. I'm not thinking anything
like they were sacrifices.

217
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,733
I'm not thinking anything
like they've died.

218
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,238
Don't mock my comrades.

219
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,745
I got you.

220
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,833
Summoning Jutsu!

221
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,769
This doesn't...look so good.

222
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,815
I'll play a melody of death for you.

223
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,778
Don't you mock us,
you damned punk.

224
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,668
I won't let you take Sasuke,
no matter what.

225
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,003
Interesting.

226
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,648
For the first time, I spoke to you

227
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,609
And you smiled

228
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,070
For the first time, I was able to speak

229
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

230
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,412
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

231
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:32,750
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

232
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,256
My clumsy attempts with words

233
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:44,345
You listened without turning away

234
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

235
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:57,900
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

236
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,820
I feel so sad
But...

237
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:04,157
For the first time, I spoke to you

238
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,410
And you smiled

239
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,829
For the first time, I was able to speak

240
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,082
In my own words

241
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,501
For the first time, I spoke to you

242
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,713
And you smiled

243
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,215
For the first time, I was able to speak

244
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,260
In my own words

245
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,765
For the first time, I spoke to you

246
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,318
Damn it! What'll I do?!

247
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,278
He's trouble enough yet,

248
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,947
but his Chakra has increased
several ten-fold!

249
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,742
It's no good. I can't use it here yet.

250
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,204
But if I stay like this, we'll...

251
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,914
I get it, Akamaru.

252
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,707
It's like you said.

253
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,793
I have no choice but to use it!

254
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,964
Next time: "Roar and Howl!
The Ultimate Tag-Team!"
