1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,683
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,479
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,612
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,837
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,420
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,275
Huh, it's Lady Tsunade.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,821
Huh? You guys are...

22
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,823
Hey, are you visiting someone
at the hospital too?

23
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,825
Yes.

24
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,326
You too, Lady Tsunade?

25
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,119
Well, I guess...

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,747
She just doesn't want to stay
in the executive office...

27
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:02,873
Shut up!

28
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,877
Hinata, don't faint when
you see Kurenai Sensei.

29
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,880
P-Please let's not talk about that.

30
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,132
Did something happen?

31
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,884
When we were visiting Naruto
in the hospital in the past...

32
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,261
Shino!

33
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,556
This girl fainted when she saw Naruto
all covered with bandages.

34
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,642
Kiba! I'll...I'll be fine this time!

35
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,854
I finally found you...!

36
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,857
Old Lady Tsunade, I need to talk to you!

37
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,739
Huh? Hinata!

38
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,408
Naruto...

39
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,703
– Naruto is...so close!
– Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong?

40
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,331
Your face looks a little red...

41
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,208
Do you have a fever or something? Huh?

42
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,586
Hey...

43
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,469
H-Hey, Hinata...?!

44
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,555
Hey Hinata!

45
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
Are you okay?! Get a hold of yourself!

46
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,642
Hinata!

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,437
Naruto...

48
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,066
The Search for the Rare Bikochu Beetle

49
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,077
Hey, you woke up.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,872
So Mizuki didn't know anything, you said?

51
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,541
Tsunade interrogated him herself.

52
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,753
He didn't have any information

53
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,797
that would lead to Orochimaru's
current whereabouts...

54
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,470
After all, that guy was nothing but
a disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh.

55
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,430
So it seems...

56
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,141
We still don't know where Sasuke went...

57
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,937
And that's the result after
a desperate fight with Mizuki...

58
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,315
That can't sit right with
Naruto either...huh?

59
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,028
Please Old Lady Tsunade, say it's okay!

60
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,488
When I say no, I mean no!

61
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,575
As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn't able
to concentrate on her work.

62
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,496
Naruto's been breathing down
her neck the whole time

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,957
asking her to let him go off
in search of Sasuke.

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,835
So she sneaked out of her office, but...

65
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,921
He was lying in wait for her here.

66
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,423
Naruto...

67
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,093
I've asked you numerous times already!

68
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,303
Please let me go in search of Sasuke!

69
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,015
I've told you numerous times already.
Impossible!

70
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,433
Why!

71
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,936
You have some training to do!

72
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,397
I can't because Pervy Sage isn't around!

73
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,735
We have zero leads on either
Orochimaru and Sasuke.

74
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,903
So how are you planning to search for him?

75
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,863
I can figure it out somehow!

76
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,409
If there aren't any leads,
I'll go find some!

77
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,827
So please let me go do it!

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,704
You're stubborn, aren't you?

79
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,789
You're stubborn too, Old Lady Tsunade!

80
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,708
– Please let me go!
– No, you may not!

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,794
If I say I'm going, I'm going!
Shut up! No means no!

82
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,759
Byakugan!

83
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,641
All right! Good work, Neji!

84
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,102
Move in another half step right there!
Yes sir!

85
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,824
Sorry to keep you waiting.

86
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,999
Let's take a break, Neji.

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,667
Yes.

88
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,298
Have some tea too.

89
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:41,925
Thank you...

90
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,432
If Hinata was here,
she should have observed a little.

91
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,643
Hinata prepared this...?

92
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,648
It would supplement her training
by observing...

93
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,291
Byakugan!

94
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,433
Let's take a break.
Yes.

95
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,268
Food! Food!

96
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,732
That was pretty well done.

97
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,318
I would say that you're getting closer
to perfecting the technique.

98
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,153
It's thanks to you both.

99
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,073
You're so kind to join me
in my special training every day...

100
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,200
We're a team.

101
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,036
When a comrade in the team is in a fix,
one offers a helping hand.

102
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,038
That's only natural...

103
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,083
A comrade...

104
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,380
If a comrade suddenly disappears,

105
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,715
it must be awfully hard.

106
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,802
You're talking about Naruto, aren't you?

107
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,183
Isn't there some way we could help him?

108
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,688
I'd like to help him out in
some way too...but...

109
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,359
Lady Hokage was telling Naruto...

110
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,862
that there are no leads at all.

111
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,118
There may be one resource...

112
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,202
Really?!

113
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,705
I'm talking about Bikochu.

114
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,957
Bikochu?

115
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,878
Are you talking about
those rare insects...?!

116
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,339
I have heard that they had
become extinct some time ago.

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,884
Since there was a possibility
that they could become extinct,

118
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,262
the Aburame Clan discontinued using them,

119
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,099
so a miniscule number of them
should still be alive.

120
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,561
Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?

121
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,898
Well...it's not surprising that
you don't know about them.

122
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,734
The last time that Bikochu were used

123
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,028
was before the last Great War...

124
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,991
Bikochu are one kind of insect
used by insect handlers.

125
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,786
Larvae which have hatched from eggs
become chrysalises in no time at all,

126
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,331
then emerge and turn into imagos.

127
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,333
They are then made to recognize scents...

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,377
and they are able to track
even the faintest scent...

129
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,922
to its source.

130
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,257
Their olfactory sense is several thousand
times greater than a Ninja Hound's.

131
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,262
They are insects capable of
exhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.

132
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,769
However, Bikochu lay eggs
only once every several years...

133
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,189
This year is actually the year
in which they lay eggs.

134
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,900
And right now is exactly
the time when they hatch.

135
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,401
I see.

136
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,488
There are still some of
Sasuke's belongings left in the village...

137
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,114
Right?

138
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,533
If one makes the Bikochu,
recognize that scent...

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,537
We may be able to locate
Sasuke's whereabouts, right?

140
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,959
What is the probability
of finding a Bikochu?

141
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,922
Frankly speaking, not very high.
Perhaps 10%.

142
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,508
10% huh...

143
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,269
As you guys know,

144
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,480
the situation in the village
is currently very grave...

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,441
We don't have the leeway of allowing
even Genin to sit around and play.

146
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:32,239
However, fortunately or unfortunately,
Kurenai has been hospitalized,

147
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,575
so you guys, Squad Eight,
no longer have a mission.

148
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,787
Rather than just letting
you sit around and play,

149
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,124
I'd rather place my bet
on that 10% possibility.

150
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,376
Huh... you mean...

151
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,548
Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka. Hinata Hyuga.

152
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,801
I order you to search for the Bikochu!

153
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,428
– All right!
– All right!

154
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,346
I designate Shino as the leader this time.

155
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,474
And...that spy up there!

156
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,025
Oww...!

157
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,109
Naruto...

158
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,320
You're going to go even if
I try to stop you, right?

159
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,404
Yup!

160
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,449
In that case, I have no choice
but to let you go...

161
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,409
However...

162
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,953
This is your last chance.

163
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,997
If you don't find the Bikochu...

164
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,916
you must give up on Sasuke!

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,501
Wha...?
You understand?!

166
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,921
It'll be fine... I'll find it without fail.

167
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,258
All right. You won't go back
on your word, right?

168
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,762
Yeah! Leave it to me!

169
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,847
You're easily pleased, aren't you?

170
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,265
Owww!

171
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,851
Naruto...

172
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,908
Sasuke...

173
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,208
Hinata.

174
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,920
Good morning.

175
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,464
Neji will be here soon for his training...

176
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,634
Please prepare tea as always.
Well...

177
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,511
Huh? What's the matter?

178
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,097
I need to go... on a mission starting now...

179
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,473
A mission, huh...

180
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,600
In that case, it can't be helped...

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,102
I'm heading out...

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,481
Don't be a burden to the others.

183
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,193
Yes, sir!

184
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,958
I'm...I'm sorry! I'm in a hurry...

185
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,921
The way she handled
her physical response just now...

186
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,340
Hinata...

187
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,430
You're late, Hinata!
I'm sorry!

188
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,393
All right then! Let's head out!

189
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,353
Let's go!

190
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,023
Huh?

191
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,734
Why are you walking at
such a leisurely pace?!

192
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,195
It takes a Shinobi two days on foot

193
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,947
to get to the habitat of the Bikochu ...

194
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,741
There's no need to make haste
from the very start.

195
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,708
But what if the eggs hatch
before we get there?

196
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,670
The eggs of Bikochu only hatch
on the day after it's rained...

197
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,006
There's no sign of it
raining any time soon...

198
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,883
But...if by some remote chance...

199
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,718
Naruto.
Wh-What is it?

200
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,804
I am the leader of this team.

201
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,432
While we are on this mission,
you will obey the orders of your leader.

202
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:56,610
Kiba, I can't believe you're able
to work with that kind of guy...

203
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,029
Well, I've gotten used to it...

204
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,073
I'm sure you'll bond with him too, Naruto.

205
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,368
I wonder about that...

206
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,462
Naruto and the others left a while ago.

207
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,547
I see.

208
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,841
Didn't you want to go too?

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,011
When it comes to searching for insects,

210
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,846
Shino, who's an insect handler,
is number one...

211
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,225
And then Hinata who has Byakugan...

212
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,810
and Kiba and Akamaru who have
sensitive noses are there too...

213
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,729
So there's really no role that
I could play!

214
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,607
What I must do right now...

215
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,944
is to become a Medical Ninja
as soon as I possibly can!

216
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,829
What's the matter, Shino?!

217
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,332
The sun's going down.
We're setting up camp.

218
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
Got it.

219
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,543
– Huh?
– Okay.

220
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,169
Huh? What...?!

221
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,296
We're gonna set up camp already?!

222
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,801
I'm not tired at all yet!
Let's go further!

223
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,305
Naruto, the leader of this team is me.

224
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,560
I-I understand!

225
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,104
Okay then...let's sleep.

226
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,022
Huh...we're gonna sleep already?!

227
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,777
Many animals and plants
go to sleep at sunset

228
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,279
and awake at sunrise.

229
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,364
In order to search for insects,

230
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,701
we must understand the rhythm
of living creatures with our own bodies...

231
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,495
But...the sun's just set...

232
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,665
Naruto, I am the leader of this team...

233
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,459
Okay, okay. I got it!

234
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,756
There's no way I can sleep so early...

235
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,094
Yeah, right...

236
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,347
All that complaining and guess
who's the first one to fall asleep?

237
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,338
I have to pee...

238
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,684
Huh? Huh?

239
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,187
What's that?

240
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:47,989
It's a waterfall...

241
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,035
Hey... Is somebody there?

242
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,017
S-Say...

243
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,855
Damn it...!

244
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,275
S-Sorry. Did I scare you?

245
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,944
Huh?

246
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,323
There's nobody there...

247
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,917
Huh, Naruto... Did you catch a cold?

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,627
Yeah...a little...

249
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,924
After sleeping so much you're still tired?

250
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,884
Well, uh...

251
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,513
When I woke up last night to pee,
I saw something awesome...

252
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,682
Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?

253
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,267
No, I'm okay...

254
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,853
And...what was that awesome thing?

255
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,355
It was a beautiful woman
in the middle of the waterfall!

256
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,523
Huh?

257
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,528
When that person moved her arms,
the water would suddenly move too!

258
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,071
It was awesome!

259
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,406
And what happened then...

260
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,451
When I tried to speak to her,
she suddenly vanished.

261
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,912
You must have been dreaming or something.

262
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,876
It's starting to feel that way...

263
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,335
You idiot!

264
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,505
Your face is red, Hinata.

265
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,382
You might have really caught a cold.

266
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,843
Huh...really, I'm fine...

267
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,851
This fruit is edible.
This will be our meal today.

268
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,770
Got it.

269
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,940
We can save on our food supplies too.

270
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,860
There's one thing
I need to warn you about.

271
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,906
On rare occasions, this fruit grows
to the size of a human being.

272
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,657
However, those fruits are damaged inside.

273
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,326
Don't tamper with them
under any circumstance.

274
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,828
There's nobody who would
eat something that huge.

275
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,581
N-Naruto...!

276
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,542
He's eating it...

277
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,136
Naruto... We're going on ahead...

278
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,680
I'll...I'll be right behind you!

279
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,641
Sorry to keep you waiting!

280
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,607
Wait just a second!

281
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,176
Hey...aren't we there yet?

282
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,263
Yes.

283
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,807
We're here!
What...?

284
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,858
Wow!

285
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,986
I've never seen anything like this before.

286
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,281
This certainly isn't a place
where humans could inhabit.

287
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,701
That's right...
That's why it's paradise for insects.

288
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,079
D-Don't tell me...

289
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,207
Could it be that...over there...?

290
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,710
You mean that's where the Bikochu are?

291
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,838
No problem.
It's better than the Chunin Exam.

292
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:40,346
Damn...The foothold crumbles easily...

293
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,806
– Naruto...
– What?

294
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,143
As the leader, I'm warning you...

295
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,520
At a time like this, what is it?!

296
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,022
Don't fall.

297
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,609
I already know that
without your telling me!

298
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,861
Naruto!

299
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,448
No way...!

300
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,330
That was close...

301
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,459
Those were insects, huh...

302
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,252
That's why I warned you.

303
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,422
When this mission is over,

304
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,591
I'm definitely gonna kick that guy's butt!

305
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,516
This is...the Bikochu forest.

306
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:30,939
Let's go.

307
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,411
There's no mistake.
Those are Leaf Shinobi.

308
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,580
The fact that those guys came to
a place like this

309
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,207
means their objective is...

310
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,629
Yeah...it's the same as ours... the Bikochu.

311
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,173
We're not gonna let them take any Bikochu.

312
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,261
The Bikochu,...
belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!

313
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:19,320
Crappy news pass us by

314
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,032
And you become speechless

315
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,579
My voice is way too soft

316
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,125
So you don't answer

317
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,547
You're crying Crying alone

318
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,635
What can I do? I'm crying too

319
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,929
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

320
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:50,560
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

321
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,355
Yeah

322
00:21:54,439 --> 00:22:00,111
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

323
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,740
Yeah

324
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:09,495
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

325
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,041
Yeah

326
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:18,921
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

327
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:25,219
Yeah

328
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,027
Huh! If you're talking about
the insect in this photograph,

329
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,153
I'm very familiar with it.

330
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,863
– Huh?
– Really?!

331
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,865
Damn...Don't tell me that was a Bikochu?

332
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,658
Where did you see it?

333
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,994
I heard some rustling in the kitchen
in the middle of the night,

334
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,204
and I unintentionally threw
a slipper at it...

335
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,371
Wait a second...

336
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,706
N-Naruto...

337
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,710
What you're talking about
is an ordinary cockroach.

338
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:02,632
