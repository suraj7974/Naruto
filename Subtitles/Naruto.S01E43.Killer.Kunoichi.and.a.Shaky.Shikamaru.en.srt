1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,482
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,214
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,725
We're speeding through life,

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,394
squeezing it for all of its worth

14
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,854
Our feet are tied

15
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,733
But we still keep going farther

16
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

17
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,534
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,831
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,264
Tenten vs. Temari

20
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,725
The fifth battle...

21
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,396
Tenten, Temari...come forward!

22
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,156
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!

23
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,119
Now...The second one from
the Land of Sand, huh...

24
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,204
Do your best!

25
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,081
– Tenten!
– It looks like it's going to be interesting.

26
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,013
Begin!

27
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:24,478
Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru

28
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,862
Go for it, Tenten!

29
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,114
Believe in your own strength, Tenten!

30
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,867
We're behind you, Tenten!

31
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,452
Knock her with all your strength!

32
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,704
That's good!

33
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,415
Cheer her on more, more,
more with passion, Lee!

34
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,499
Yeah!

35
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,085
These guys are noisy!

36
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,264
That spacing is just what I'd expect
from Tenten,

37
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,641
not too close, not too far.

38
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:06,061
Attacks or defense,
she can respond to either one.

39
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,313
What happened?

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,565
Please begin.

41
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,279
Are you planning to wait out and
see how I make my move?

42
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,614
Let me just tell you,

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,451
once I start my attack
you'll be over in a second.

44
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,039
You're trying to be cool and
see what I do first...

45
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,541
A hundred years too early!

46
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,501
It doesn't matter to me, come first.

47
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,754
You said it...

48
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,089
Well, I won't hold back.

49
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,140
They missed? That's impossible!

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,935
What happened?
Is that a warm-up?

51
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,105
Or are you scared and your aim is off?

52
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,609
I thought I would enjoy it
a little bit more,

53
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,362
but evidently it's not promising.

54
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,948
No way!

55
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,617
I can't believe Tenten's attack missed!

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,577
It's unbelievable indeed.

57
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,412
Tenten's weapons...

58
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,623
always hits the mark
ten out of ten times.

59
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,833
There no reason for them to miss.

60
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,129
That's right...
She didn't miss.

61
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,214
She was made to miss.

62
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,594
As always, she's being disagreeable.

63
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,221
How foolish...

64
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,848
How disgraceful!

65
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,933
Huh?

66
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,977
Sand wins again.

67
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,063
We don't know that yet.

68
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,439
We know.

69
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,776
How?
How do we know?

70
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,445
Explain it so I understand!

71
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:43,409
Stupid... As if I'd do
such a bothersome thing.

72
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:47,413
Shikamaru said it so,
surely that's how it is.

73
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,001
These guys are hard to understand.

74
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,547
Calm down...

75
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,466
Don't let her get to you...

76
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,219
One.

77
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,971
Two.

78
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,931
Three...

79
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,934
If it's gonna get dodged,

80
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,894
I just have to make
it impossible to!

81
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,151
So she's measuring the spacing,
next one is going to be the big attack.

82
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,945
I get it...

83
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,947
So, that fan is the secret.

84
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,323
If so...

85
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,126
How about...this?!

86
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,856
No way!

87
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,067
My flying weapons!

88
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,486
Is there a secret mechanism
in the fan...?

89
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,990
This is... the first star.

90
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,450
There are two more.

91
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,579
When the third star appears,

92
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,872
you will lose.

93
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,586
Tenten!

94
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,298
Don't be taken in by
your opponent, be calm!

95
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
Be calm!

96
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,552
I know...

97
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,430
Lee, I really intended to use
this in the main battle,

98
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,891
not the preliminary round...

99
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,893
but it looks like I can't do it that way.

100
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,735
She's already going to use it?

101
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,573
Pulling out two scrolls?

102
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,700
What does she intend to do?

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
Hah! No matter what you do,
it won't work.

104
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,843
Rising Twin Dragons!

105
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,033
Even if you increase the amount,
it's still the same!

106
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,536
Second star!

107
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,296
I'm not done yet!

108
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,232
Did I do it?

109
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,166
Third star.

110
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,839
She disappeared!

111
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,843
Where is she?

112
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,804
I'm over here!

113
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,306
Darn...!

114
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,490
Ninja Art!

115
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,701
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

116
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,830
Tenten!

117
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,886
Chakra is enfolded in that wind.

118
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,971
Huh?!

119
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,682
Tenten fought well...

120
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:21,478
But she won't be able to escape from
that twister.

121
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,698
T-That's awful.

122
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,324
Tenten...!

123
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,954
How boring...really.

124
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:44,001
To think she completely intercepted
Tenten's weapon attacks.

125
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,836
This is ridiculous!

126
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,797
What's going on with her...?

127
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,760
It's just like Shikamaru said,
it's the Sand's win.

128
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,762
That's why I said it.

129
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,850
There's no reason for us to lose here.

130
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,480
The Land of Sand is to be feared...

131
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,445
Temari wins the fifth battle.

132
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,156
Oh no!

133
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,381
Nice catch.

134
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,425
What are you doing?!

135
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,387
Is that something you do to
an opponent who fought to the utmost?!

136
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,723
You're annoying!

137
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,100
Take that trash away already!

138
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,478
Stop! Lee!

139
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,979
Leaf Hurricane!

140
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,398
What?!

141
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,400
You're just like you look...

142
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,736
You're dull too.

143
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,196
What did you say?!

144
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,655
Stop! Lee!

145
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,116
Guy Sensei!

146
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,994
Temari.

147
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,623
Come up quick, you've been
declared the winner.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,587
Don't keep company with that awful-looking
guy and his chaperone forever.

149
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,047
What...?!

150
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,308
That's enough, Lee.

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,523
Gentlemen of Sand...

152
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,443
I wonder if I may give you
a word of warning.

153
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,781
This kid is strong.

154
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,866
You should prepare yourselves.

155
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,123
Picking a fight with the Sand...

156
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,544
I absolutely wouldn't want to
do it with those guys.

157
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,172
T-They're all awesome guys...

158
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,763
Don't lose to those guys!

159
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,848
Naruto!

160
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,516
S-Sakura.

161
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,019
Sakura... Are you okay already?

162
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,731
Never mind that,
you should worry about yourself!

163
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,735
Huh? Me? I don't have
an injury or anything.

164
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,571
That's not what I mean.

165
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,699
If you lose here, it's a point of dishonor.

166
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,742
You'd be ashamed to face Sasuke!

167
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,703
Y- Yeah.

168
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,037
And...

169
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,166
Thanks for earlier...

170
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,126
No!

171
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,128
Sakura!

172
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,339
You did your hardest
to get here!

173
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,552
You'll disgrace women if
you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!

174
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,015
If it weren't for your stupid cheering
at that time...

175
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,144
I would have been soundly
beaten by Ino.

176
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,854
Yeah, that's right.

177
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,564
Y-You!

178
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,322
Okay, hurry hurry!
Me next!

179
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,531
Next!
Next is my turn!

180
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,534
Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin

181
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,994
Darn!

182
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,455
It's me.

183
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,167
Shikamaru, don't lose!

184
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,461
– Show us that you're a real man!
– All right, all right.

185
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,839
Get her with the 16 combo, go!

186
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,675
– Win Shikamaru!
– Ino's become super energetic.

187
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,428
You go for it!

188
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,181
That guy manipulates shadows.

189
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,308
Be careful of the shadows...

190
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,688
I won't be beaten by
a stupid technique like that.

191
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,817
Shikamaru!

192
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,487
Bash that one around!
And while you're at it...

193
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,614
Man, what a pain.

194
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,451
Furthermore, my opponent is a woman...
It's hard to get to it.

195
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,037
If that's what you think,
I'll end this quickly.

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,914
Go, go! Shikamaru!

197
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,668
Well, you could say that
I know these guys' raw power

198
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,586
from that incident from the second test...

199
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,426
I don't know anything about this one's Jutsu.

200
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,349
On top of that, she's seen my Jutsu...

201
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,519
– The sixth battle.
– That being said, for me...

202
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,479
Shikamaru versus Kin!

203
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,439
Begin!

204
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,775
I can only do this.

205
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,027
One trick pony, huh...?

206
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,112
Shut up!

207
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,407
Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!

208
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,616
That Jutsu!

209
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,579
It's nothing if I just pay attention
to the movement of your shadow!

210
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,712
Bells...?

211
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,882
Heh, that's a classic.

212
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,218
Next, you'll throw Senbons with bells

213
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,430
and Senbons without bells
at the same time, right?

214
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,518
I'll respond to the sound of the bells,
intending to dodge them.

215
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,315
But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,
and, ouch.

216
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,358
Is that right?

217
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,068
You're a chatty guy!

218
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,155
So in order to not get caught
by the shadow Senbons...

219
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,032
I'm alert to the trick
and look closely...

220
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,118
What?!

221
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,578
Behind?!

222
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,083
String?

223
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,503
Darn it!
Too late!

224
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,465
Shikamaru!

225
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,425
He took that pretty bad.

226
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,428
It wasn't tat bad, look closely.
Huh?

227
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,765
F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.

228
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,434
Now it's my turn!

229
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,603
That's not going to happen.

230
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,573
W-What's this?

231
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:59,459
That happens to anyone
who hears my bell.

232
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,380
The sound vibration of
this special bell

233
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,966
reaches the brain directly
from the ear drum.

234
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,345
And then it will make you hallucinate.

235
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,140
It's useless!

236
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,268
You can't avoid the sound of
my bell by doing...

237
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,814
that...that...that...that...that...

238
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,026
Shoot! Which one?
Which is the real one?

239
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,029
You can't do anything, can you?

240
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:34,619
Your shadow, which was your faint hope,
doesn't even know where to stretch to...

241
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,041
Well... I'll cook you slowly.

242
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,420
Taking me lightly...!

243
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,637
This time it's five,
next time seven...

244
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,016
I'll continue until you become
a hedgehog.

245
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,228
Y-You're lying, you brat!
Huh?!

246
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,896
You'd end it soon...

247
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,107
That's what you said
in the beginning, isn't it?

248
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,653
I see, you can't endure the pain
and want to be eased.

249
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,074
Well, I'll finish it here.

250
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,326
It's your death warrant.

251
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,000
W-What?!

252
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,461
M-My body...

253
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,049
At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success.

254
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,636
W-What are you saying?

255
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,514
No way!
Your shadow isn't anywhere...

256
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,225
You don't realize it yet?

257
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,728
I-It can't be...

258
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,689
It's just that, you fool!

259
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,194
A thread at this height
can't have a shadow.

260
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,907
I can stretch and shrink
my own shadow.

261
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,951
The shadow is gradually getting thicker.

262
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,371
This wasn't the shadow of the thread...

263
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,082
That's right. I stretched my shadow
and made it narrow,

264
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,045
so it looked like the shadow of
a thread and stuck it on you.

265
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,885
But... How do you win with that?

266
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,054
I'm just gonna move
the same way as you.

267
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,722
Annoying.

268
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,390
Be quiet and watch.

269
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,690
Stupid!

270
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,776
If you continue like this and attack...

271
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,695
You, too,
will be wounded!

272
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,448
I know that.

273
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,493
No way! You're...!

274
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,119
We're gonna throw shuriken
at each other.

275
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,704
How far will we go...?

276
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,414
Fool, stop it!

277
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,256
You're only talk...

278
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,384
And that one's a goner.

279
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,679
If you're a shinobi,

280
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,890
you have to grasp the situation
and the layout when you battle.

281
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,434
Even though we made
the same movements...

282
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:08,648
the distance of the walls behind
each of us was different.

283
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,608
I just used the shuriken and

284
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:15,572
called attention away
from the wall behind us.

285
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,824
Winner! Shikamaru Nara.

286
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,201
Good job Shikamaru!

287
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,661
Cool!

288
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,622
Me next... Me next... Me next...!

289
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,711
That guy's dull and plain,
but that was kinda cool.

290
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,795
Shoot!

291
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,257
I'm the only one left.

292
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,260
And the next match.

293
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,971
The people left are one Sound ninja,

294
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,683
me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.

295
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,727
And that Sand guy...

296
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,188
Just please spare me from that guy.

297
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,068
This year's rookie looks quite challenging...

298
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,083
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka

299
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,711
It's here, it's here, it's here!

300
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,796
What we've been waiting for!

301
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,049
It's finally my turn!

302
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,551
Yeah! Lucky us!

303
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,638
If it's this guy
we'll absolutely win, Akamaru!

304
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,515
Yahoo!

305
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,893
– If I'm not next, Sakura will despise me...
– I'm gonna do it!

306
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,520
– and call me Bushy Brow.
– I'm gonna go for it!

307
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,857
– If I'm not next. Sakura will...
– Just watch me! Yay!

308
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:37,236
This Lee kid, he's just like
Guy was in the past...

309
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,869
Do your best, Naruto.

310
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,663
Leave it to me.

311
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:51,125
Well Naruto, show us...

312
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,252
how much you've grown.

313
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,883
I'm going to do it!

314
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:10,228
Hey, can you hear it?

315
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,064
The clear, blue sky

316
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:19,570
goes on and on

317
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,156
The ocean

318
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,663
spans limitlessly

319
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,416
Please keep

320
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:37,171
that smile on your face forever

321
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:43,511
Or else I'll cry

322
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,390
You won't have to search around you

323
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,352
It's all ok now.

324
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:56,733
Everyone is inside

325
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,153
this hand

326
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:05,408
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

327
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,871
When you forget what happiness is

328
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,875
Just sing.

329
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,088
Light is born, and darkness was born

330
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,382
The two are one

331
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:28,181
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

332
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:33,478
Hey, can you hear it?

333
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,025
Darn that Kiba!

334
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,652
I hold back a little bit and
he rides my brain.

335
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,613
Yap, yap, yap, yap,
it's annoying! Believe it!

336
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,616
Just quit talking tough, and use your dog
or whatever, and come at me!

337
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,202
I don't know what kind of
training you've done,

338
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,080
but I'm the man who's going
to become Hokage.

339
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:56,334
You're the one who's going
to get his butt kicked.

340
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,962
Next time: "Akamaru Unleashed!
Who's Top Dog Now?"

341
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,672
Don't take me lightly!
