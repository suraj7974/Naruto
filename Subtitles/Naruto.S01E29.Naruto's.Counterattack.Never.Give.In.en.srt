1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,903
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,295
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,881
Now

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,729
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,414
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,597
If there's an instance that we
become separated,

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,974
don't trust him if he looks
like your teammate.

20
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,228
Just like now there's a possibility

21
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,021
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,147
Yeah.

23
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,607
So what do we do?

24
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,527
We'll decide on a password.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,570
Password?

26
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,491
I'll only say it once so listen closely.

27
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,994
You ask Ninja song, "Ninja Chance."

28
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,704
And the answer is this:

29
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,750
"It is a chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

30
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,253
"The quiet place has
no secret hideout.

31
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,965
"It is important for
a Shinobi to know the right time.

32
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,426
"The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard."

33
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,553
That's it.

34
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,930
H-Huge!

35
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,143
T-Tail!

36
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,653
You want our Earth Scroll, don't you?

37
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,711
Well, let's begin...

38
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,507
the battle for the Scrolls.

39
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,803
Life or death!

40
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,149
If this creature doesn't want
to spit me out ...

41
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,402
I'll make it to do so at any cost!

42
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,448
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

43
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,581
I can't move!

44
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,671
I wanted you to entertain me more.

45
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,257
It's too bad.

46
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,639
Move!

47
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,564
He wiped out the fear with pain.

48
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,779
As expected,
he's not the average prey.

49
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,289
Don't come near me!

50
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,675
Don't lower your guard,
not even for a moment...

51
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:33,524
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately

52
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,611
before a predator!

53
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,499
Sorry Sasuke.

54
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,800
Naruto!

55
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,973
The password... I forgot it!

56
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,269
Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!

57
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,073
The password... I forgot it!

58
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,160
That's all right, Naruto!
Awesome!

59
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,248
Naruto!

60
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,500
I know you tried to be cool and
intended to rescue us, but...

61
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,377
Don't put your nose in this!
Escape!

62
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,006
This thing...
She's on a far different level!

63
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,969
Seems like you brought that
giant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.

64
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:49,516
No matter how you look,
she looks like a snake...

65
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,318
I get it, it was the handiwork
of this woman.

66
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,786
The situation has never gotten any better
with him showing up for the rescue.

67
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,497
But what should I do...?

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,461
Hey hey hey! Evidently you've been
bullying the weakling!

69
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,589
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,

70
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,549
I'm going to wipe the floor with you!

71
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,595
Darn it! If it continues like this,
all three of us are done for!

72
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,598
What should I do?

73
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,773
Sasuke...

74
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,407
It's no good.

75
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,661
This is the only way.

76
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,792
-Wait.
-Hmm?

77
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,752
-Huh?!
-Huh?

78
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,970
If it's the scroll you want,
I'll give it to you.

79
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,974
I'm asking you.
Just take this and go.

80
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,393
-Huh?!
-What?!

81
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,023
Hey, Sasuke!
What are you doing?

82
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,776
Why are you giving
our scroll to the enemy?

83
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,570
You, shut up!

84
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,904
What ...?!

85
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,075
I see...
You're sensible.

86
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,123
The only thing the "prey" can
hope for from the "predator" is

87
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:41,628
presenting other food and
pray you would be spared, isn't it?

88
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,473
-Take it.
-Wha...?!

89
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,483
You! Don't interfere with this!

90
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,903
Don't you understand this situation?!

91
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,581
What're you doing all of a sudden?!

92
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,057
As for me,
I don't remember the password...

93
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,935
So I got no way to make sure.

94
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,313
But you, you're an imposter
Sasuke, aren't you?

95
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,731
Naruto!

96
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,776
W-What are you trying to start?!

97
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,988
You loser!
I'm the real me!

98
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,991
Liar.

99
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,539
This, this stupid coward is...

100
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,086
absolutely...
not the Sasuke I know!

101
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,048
I don't know how strong she is but,

102
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,970
how can you be sure that she'll let us
go if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!

103
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,976
You're the one who choked and
doesn't understand this situation!

104
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,605
Naruto.

105
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,527
That's correct.

106
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,948
The Scroll.

107
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,705
I could just kill you
and seize it.

108
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,669
Don't mess with me!

109
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,629
Run, Naruto! Stop it!

110
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,548
Darn it!

111
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,426
I've lost confidence in you, Sasuke!

112
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,219
Summoning Jutsu!

113
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,066
Naruto!

114
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,707
There are three corpses.

115
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,670
This is some kind of Ninja Art,
isn't it...?

116
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,132
This is bad.

117
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,804
We have a problem,
from the get go.

118
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,473
I'll be darned.

119
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,815
Inform Anko,
the Proctor of the second test.

120
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,983
Yes, sir!

121
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,909
If you're going to have dumplings,
you've got to have sweet red bean soup.

122
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,874
Okay...
Once I've eaten this,

123
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,294
I should break through and
go wait at the tower for the kids.

124
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,884
With this program, the quick kids
should clear it soon.

125
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,388
The Leaf Village mark, perfect!

126
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,770
We have a problem, Ms. Anko!

127
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,357
Huh? What, so suddenly?

128
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,359
Corpses! Three of them!

129
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,072
Moreover, they're strange.

130
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,865
Anyway, please come!

131
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,786
Strange?

132
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,755
I checked their possessions
and identification,

133
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,969
Ninjas from Grass Village
registered in the Chunin Exam, but...

134
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,138
As you can see...

135
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,517
They have no faces.

136
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,146
Yes.

137
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,942
They're smooth and flat,
like they melted away.

138
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,656
Without a doubt...

139
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,117
This Jutsu is...

140
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,620
that man's...

141
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,332
Why is he at this test...?

142
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,902
Show me the ID photos of
these three Grass Village Ninjas.

143
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,236
It's on their applications.

144
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,321
Yes!

145
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,493
So this one's face was robbed.

146
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,747
Then, at that time it was already...

147
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,210
I'll return... the Kunai knife.

148
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,670
Thank you for your trouble.

149
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,551
We're in big trouble.

150
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,636
Huh?!

151
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,598
Communicate this to
Lord Hokage right away!

152
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,476
Make a call for action to
the Anbu Black Ops

153
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,478
to assemble more than two squads
to the Forest of Death!

154
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,357
Starting now,
I'm going to follow these guys! Got it?

155
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,608
Yes!

156
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,863
That guy...

157
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,658
That guy...has come to Leaf Village!

158
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,215
Cute.

159
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,635
You're such a cute prey.

160
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,641
Naruto!

161
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,892
Narutooo!

162
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,946
Well, polish him off.

163
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,464
Shove it!

164
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,561
This brat! Can't be...

165
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,323
Naruto... He's lost control...

166
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,452
But...that Naruto,
why is he so strong?!

167
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,099
Those eyes...

168
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,851
There's no mistake.

169
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,313
That's...Naruto?!

170
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,067
This just got interesting.

171
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,277
Next is...

172
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,198
Sasuke.

173
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,283
Now what's your move?!

174
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,500
Sasuke!

175
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,137
I have to hurry.

176
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,641
I get this...

177
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,019
bad feeling.

178
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,709
Hey. Are you hurt?

179
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,757
Scaredy cat?!

180
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,976
Naruto!

181
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,770
Hey!

182
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,648
Are you hurt...

183
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,484
Scaredy cat?

184
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,948
Sasuke!

185
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:22,417
This stupid coward is absolutely
not the Sasuke I know!

186
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,259
Huh?!

187
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:36,264
Darn it!
Let me go!

188
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,557
You stupid snake!

189
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,814
To think that the
nine-tailed brat lived...

190
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:53,531
When you get excited, a bit
of the nine-tail's power trickles out...

191
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,331
You've grown up interesting.

192
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,919
Look...

193
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,129
The Seal is appearing on
your skin like a tattoo.

194
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,011
Five-Pronged...Sealing!

195
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,192
Sasuke! Help Naruto!

196
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,247
Twelve years since the seal...

197
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,460
Naruto's Chakras and the nine-tail's
Chakras are beginning to act in synch...

198
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,344
But now... you're in the way.

199
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,726
He's gonna fall as it is!

200
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,687
Naruto!

201
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,650
What happened Sasuke?!

202
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,239
Sasuke...

203
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:26,291
Naruto's certainly different
from you, Sasuke.

204
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,918
He's a klutz and
kind of gets in the way.

205
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,630
But he's not in the least a coward!

206
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,924
Right?
Isn't that right?

207
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,226
You foolish little brother.

208
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,023
If you want to kill me,
resent me, hate me and...

209
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,110
continue to live your ugly life.

210
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
Flee.

211
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,033
Flee and hang on to your life.

212
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,203
No!

213
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:18,760
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan...
his blood has begun to stir...

214
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,223
Sasuke!

215
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,981
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.

216
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,061
Hey, can you hear it?

217
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:15,108
The clear, blue sky

218
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,695
Goes on and on

219
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,948
The ocean

220
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:27,954
spans limitlessly

221
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,459
Please keep that smile

222
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,713
On your face forever

223
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:43,094
Or else I'll cry

224
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,098
You won't have to search around you

225
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,144
It's all ok now.

226
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,566
Everyone is inside

227
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,944
This hand

228
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:05,074
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

229
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:09,662
When you forget what happiness is

230
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,624
Just sing.

231
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,838
Light is born, and darkness was born

232
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,090
The two are one

233
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:27,472
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

234
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:33,061
Hey, can you hear it?

235
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,525
I'm an avenger.

236
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,820
To defeat my brother,
today I have to survive!

237
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:47,450
But how can a person who won't risk
his life in a situation like this

238
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,826
beat my brother?

239
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,371
Calm down, you should be able to see.

240
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,707
There should be some way
to intercept her movements.

241
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:00,880
