1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,138
Like I said, I've already told you
everything I know.

17
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,600
You first met Genno at Ichiraku...

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,061
What did you talk about then?

19
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,522
I don't remember everything!

20
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,107
That's what we want to know.

21
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,734
If we analyze your conversation,

22
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,904
we might be able to figure out
who hired Genno.

23
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,491
We already know all
the conversations

24
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,326
that you've had during
the past two weeks.

25
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,579
What we want to know is what
you guys talked about before that.

26
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,542
You tell me that but...
I don't remember...

27
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,005
Then we'll put you
under Regressive Hypnosis.

28
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,466
Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?

29
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,884
Using hypnosis,

30
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,429
we can bring out the memory of
the past from your subconscious...

31
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,182
Oh...
Just relax...

32
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,061
Back to the Past Jutsu!

33
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,448
Let's start...

34
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,912
Right now you are traveling
through your memories...

35
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:47,877
A day ago... two days ago...
three days ago...

36
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,129
Keep going back into the past.

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,925
And...it's the day you met
the old carpenter.

38
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,219
Where are you?

39
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:02,349
Inside...the forest...

40
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:09,899
The Anbu Gives Up?
Naruto's Recollection
I was training on my own...
And it was lunch time so...

41
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,192
I headed for Ichiraku...

42
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,570
And that's where...

43
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,742
You met him not inside
the restaurant, but outside, yes?

44
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,832
Hey, what are you doing?

45
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,375
Huh? Oh yes...

46
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,670
I was just trying to figure out if
I should go into the restaurant or not.

47
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,589
Is it any good?

48
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,216
Old man, you're not from here are you.

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,348
Oh... I'm a freelance carpenter.
How did you know?

50
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,312
Because all the Leaf Village people
know that Ichiraku's ramen is the best!

51
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,564
I see...

52
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,484
Here you go!
Thanks for waiting!

53
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,365
Yes! This is quite good!

54
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,491
Isn't it?!

55
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,205
Thank you for this meal!

56
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,499
You're already done?

57
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,335
I am a growing boy!

58
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,420
Even an extra large isn't
enough for me!

59
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,840
I see... Then, why don't I give
you some of mine.

60
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,217
What? Are you sure?

61
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,635
Yes.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,553
Lucky!

63
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,641
Thanks...old man!

64
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:35,567
So...we said good-bye after
we finished eating the ramen...

65
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,028
And when did you meet him next?

66
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,990
I met him in front of Ichiraku again...

67
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,951
Byakugan!

68
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,591
There's nothing here either...

69
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,801
I see...

70
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,103
Byakugan!

71
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:21,989
I see...

72
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,461
It seems like there were
odor neutralizing components

73
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,254
in last night's smoke screen.

74
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,548
He was quite prepared

75
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,842
Then why did he get caught?

76
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,554
Well, that's because our Anbu Black Ops
are really good, right...?

77
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,431
He should have known

78
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,767
that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent
before he infiltrated us...

79
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,772
He should have had
other escape routes ready.

80
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,691
Now that you mention it,
that sounds about right...

81
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,777
But right now,
there's no way to find out.

82
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,155
Dead men tell no tales, I see.

83
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:09,912
Over here.

84
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,961
What are you doing?

85
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,838
We're connecting the pieces
of the corpse.

86
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,132
Connecting the pieces...

87
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,511
It was in a really awful shape.

88
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,848
From what I hear,
he had Paper Bombs all over his body...

89
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,268
Would you like to wait outside
until we're done?

90
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,979
I-I suppose so...

91
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,064
I'll stay here!

92
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,273
What?

93
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,197
You're quite impressive...

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,241
Sakura.

95
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,588
And he gave me eggs and
barbeque pork that time...

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,465
He's talking about Ramen again.

97
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,842
Shh!

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,761
Oh, I remember that time...!

99
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,222
What happened?

100
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:14,101
He showed...me a photograph.

101
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,185
A photograph?

102
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,648
A photograph of a guy that
looked about my age.

103
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:25,154
When I asked him why
he was so nice to me...

104
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,614
I have a grandson.

105
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,577
He's about the same age as you.

106
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,746
So I can't think of you as a stranger.

107
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:41,712
I look forward to treasure hunting with
my grandson on my days off.

108
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,714
Treasure hunting?

109
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Yeah...

110
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,262
What, you're already done eating?!

111
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,141
Then I'll give you some of mine.

112
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,393
Thanks, old man!

113
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,024
What happened to your hand?

114
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,776
Oh... It's a scar from a long time ago

115
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,778
when I accidentally cut myself
with a saw.

116
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,739
Oh.

117
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,744
And then he gave me
his ramen again...

118
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,330
Genno has no relatives...

119
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,582
Then his story about
his grandson a lie?

120
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,336
We started marking him the next day.

121
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,088
I think any more inquiries are pointless.

122
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,549
I guess he wouldn't be careless enough

123
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,802
to leak any information even to a Gennin.

124
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,558
An emergency report
from Lady Tsunade!

125
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,902
I see... There was nothing unusual
about any of the buildings.

126
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,655
They were all built
according to their plans...

127
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,115
There were no signs of any traps.

128
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:58,330
So was it just camouflage for him
to sneak in as a carpenter?

129
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,958
It's too soon to make a judgment on that.

130
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,252
If he was just supposed to
steal the plans,

131
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,796
there was no need for him
to be a carpenter.

132
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,300
By the way,
what were you guys looking up?

133
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,262
We got a list of places where
he used to stop by

134
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,347
from his carpenter buddies,

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,307
and we're looking through
all those places,

136
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,518
but so far we haven't found any clues.

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,105
Oh, there're a lot of restaurants...

138
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,276
Yeah... Seems like he never
went out besides to go eat.

139
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,279
In the meantime, Hinata,
you go see Ino and Sakura

140
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,738
at the forensics center.

141
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,741
Neji and Choji, you guys go
help Kiba and Shino!

142
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,743
Understood.

143
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,250
Then, we should get going too...

144
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,459
Shikamaru!

145
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,629
Lady Tsunade is calling for you!

146
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,048
The Fifth Hokage is?

147
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,554
What?! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls?

148
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,516
It seems that they've committed
all their troops into battle position.

149
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,937
They're calling it
a big practice run, however...

150
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,898
Big practice run...?

151
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,525
I don't think I need to say more, but...

152
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,486
It's been used many times in the past.
They get all of their troops together

153
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,158
for the purpose of a big practice run
and then invade another country...

154
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,203
Furthermore, there is information that
Genno stayed in

155
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,288
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls

156
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,832
before coming to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

157
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,294
It wouldn't be unusual if there
was some sort of connection.

158
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,590
Most of the Ninja we've deployed

159
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,009
have already been mobilized
to the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.

160
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,430
Crossing the border will be
taken as a sign of willful invasion.

161
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,223
We will attack anyone that enters.

162
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,645
Shikamaru, I want you to
head over to the border, too!

163
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,361
I don't think that there's
a need for us to go.

164
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,321
Shikamaru?!

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,740
What do you mean...?

166
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,163
Naruto.
Hey, Naruto!

167
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,331
Huh?

168
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,210
You're getting in the way of my business
by standing there!

169
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,337
Oh... Sorry.

170
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,176
Now that I think about it,

171
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,805
I've never seen the old man finish
his ramen...

172
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,183
Could it be that he hated ramen?

173
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,187
But then why did he come to
Ichiraku all the time?

174
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,736
Tell us why.

175
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,156
Ten Gennin and one Chunin...

176
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,449
Our presence or absence won't
make much of a difference

177
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,034
to the overall situation.

178
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,036
What is your point...?

179
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,372
I don't like it...

180
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,210
Old Man Genno's actions...

181
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,171
After the investigation,
I've figured it out...

182
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:57,175
His everyday activities were
quite impressive...

183
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,678
His abilities as a carpenter
was average,

184
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,889
he was quite plain, never stood out,
and never made any big mistakes

185
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,351
Nobody hated him,
and nobody liked him.

186
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,813
Even if he were to disappear
all of a sudden,

187
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,524
no one would think twice
about it the next day...

188
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,443
A very low-key profile.

189
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,906
It's an undercover technique
that's so impressive

190
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,783
that I'd want to put it
in a Shinobi textbooks.

191
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:27,873
A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked
by the Anbu Black Ops so easily...

192
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,250
Don't you think that's a bit strange...?

193
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,210
That's true...

194
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,796
And when he was trying to get away...

195
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,551
He was able to get away from
the Anbu Black Ops,

196
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,178
but they caught up to him.

197
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,973
For a trap professional,
it seems like such a lame end.

198
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,315
On top of all that, the plans
have completely disappeared.

199
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,151
It doesn't make any sense to me.

200
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
And...?

201
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,657
Everything is moving
along according to his plan.

202
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,744
It couldn't be...?

203
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,454
His true identity being discovered,

204
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,498
and dying in front of
the Anbu Black Ops...

205
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,958
What if all of that was his plan?

206
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,213
And if he had predicted that
we would all leave the village

207
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,965
in taking precautions against
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls...

208
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,596
We could be just dancing on
the palm of his hand.

209
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,850
But if we look at all the information
we have at this point,

210
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,019
we need to be on alert for
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.

211
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,896
That's true, but...

212
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,065
However...

213
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:39,569
I don't think the situation will
change much

214
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,531
just by sending another ten Gennin
and one Chunin...

215
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,995
I'll have the Shikamaru squad
continue to investigate Genno.

216
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,414
Understood.

217
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,627
Shikamaru! Choji!

218
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,963
Sorry... I didn't mean to make you wait.

219
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,551
My head hurts...

220
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,845
Hey. Why do we have to
look through these books?

221
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:11,351
I don't want to do it either.
But this is the basis of investigation.

222
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,522
But still... There're so many numbers,
my eyes are hurting.

223
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm sorry...
I still can't find it .

224
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,694
I see...

225
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,362
What?

226
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,864
The old recommendation letter
that enabled them

227
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,534
to figure out that Genno's
recommendation letter was a fake.

228
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,495
Why do you have to look for that?

229
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,497
Just a hunch...

230
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,502
Did the people of this house just lose it?
Or did he...

231
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,879
In either case,

232
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,631
he should have wanted to get rid of

233
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,466
the recommendation letter
that he brought...

234
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,429
Why would he just get rid of
the old recommendation letter?

235
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,519
This is where he took his own life...?.

236
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,731
It seems that they've already
collected the remains.

237
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,691
It's a job done by the Anbu Black Ops...

238
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,192
They don't leave anything behind.

239
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,988
Everyone, come over here!

240
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,367
Look, the tree is burned on both sides!

241
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,411
The Paper Bombs exploded...

242
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,912
There should be burned marks.

243
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,081
The fact that it's on both sides
is the problem!

244
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,626
I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,

245
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,586
it wouldn't have left marks on both sides.

246
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,881
There would have to be
at least two explosions

247
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,799
to leave this kind of burn marks.

248
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,469
But according to the Anbu Black Ops,

249
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,764
he exploded the Paper Bombs
that were wrapped around his body.

250
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:34,643
But no one saw him at the moment
of the explosion...

251
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,145
There may be Anbu Black Ops,

252
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,023
but they'd still need to dodge
the explosion.

253
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,863
This one's burned on both sides too...

254
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,826
Same on this tree too.

255
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,787
Probably...

256
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,539
First, the Paper Bombs that
were placed on

257
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,166
the trees in the surrounding area
were blown up...

258
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,794
Then there was a huge explosion
in the center.

259
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,548
If he had set off the explosions
close to each other,

260
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,926
then it's possible to perceive it
as one explosion!

261
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,345
I see...
But in order to do that,

262
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,014
he would have needed to set up
some sort of trick before hand.

263
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,684
Didn't Genno take his life

264
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,894
after being cornered by
the Anbu Black Ops?

265
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,813
What if they didn't catch up to him,

266
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,857
but rather,
he let them catch up to him?

267
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,027
So you're saying that
he was running away

268
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,321
planning to let them
catch up to him here?!

269
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,990
It's not impossible...

270
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,575
If that is the case...

271
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,995
It's possible that he could
have laid other traps

272
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,205
Could it be that...

273
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,332
the fact he killed himself with
the Paper Bombs is also...

274
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,840
It's done.
They said you could come in.

275
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,508
Y-Yeah.

276
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,722
It's impossible.

277
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,890
Didn't the Anbu Black Ops make sure
with their own eyes...?

278
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,142
Yeah.

279
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,438
There's no point in telling me
to check out the body.

280
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,482
I'm not a Medical Ninja.

281
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,860
What should I check
and how should I do it...?

282
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,406
Sakura...

283
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,369
This man... He snuck in as
a carpenter right?

284
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,330
That's right. Is there something
that bothers you?

285
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,208
His hand... It's too clean.

286
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,711
My family owns a flower shop,
remember?

287
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,549
I've been helping out
since I was a kid...

288
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,802
So if I look at a person's hand,
I can tell what kind of job they do...

289
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,640
Carpenter's hands are much more rough.

290
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,519
And there's no way that a trap
professional's hand would be so clean!

291
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,354
Then...!

292
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,981
May I?

293
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,484
Byakugan!

294
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,279
Just as I suspected...

295
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,448
There's no evidence that he's trained
his Chakra Network.

296
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,409
This man has never controlled
a Chakra...

297
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,702
What?

298
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,330
The people from the medical group
were talking over there.

299
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,540
That they have some questions
about this body...

300
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,294
This person is not a Ninja!

301
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,554
Reporting! The spearhead of
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls

302
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,765
is about to reach the borders!

303
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,559
They're fast...
What about our enforcement army?

304
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,895
They are gathering currently,

305
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,189
but they're not in position
for battle quite yet...

306
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:31,152
What if they attack even before
we're in position for battle?

307
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,821
In any case...
Who would have thought

308
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,739
that the Village Hidden in
the Waterfalls would...

309
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,908
Nothing will come of that right now.

310
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,494
Once the enemy crosses that river,

311
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,496
we will see that as their intent
to wage war on us,

312
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,039
and we will start to attack!

313
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,207
Yes!

314
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,808
Academy?

315
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,228
There were no plans for the Academy...

316
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,694
Excuse me!
Could you help me?

317
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,947
Did you call?

318
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,201
We saw that the Academy had
made some payments last month...

319
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,036
Last month?

320
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:30,086
Oh this. We did some
reparation work for the Academy.

321
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,964
We don't have the plans for that.

322
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,300
No, that's not possible...

323
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,888
That's strange...
Where did I put it?

324
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,270
What's going on?

325
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,735
Above...?

326
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,076
What's the matter, Naruto?

327
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,291
What's going on?

328
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,134
They should show themselves soon...

329
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,096
Reporting! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls spearhead

330
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,599
that was closing in on the borders
has started to retreat!

331
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,850
What?!

332
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,771
It seems like it really was
a practice run...

333
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,857
Then where are the stolen plans?!

334
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,404
Th-This is...

335
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,743
This is Shikamaru's...

336
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,746
These are the plans?

337
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,830
Yeah...

338
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,835
It's written in a complex code
so that it's not easily decyphered.

339
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,297
But...

340
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,763
Why are the plans that were stolen
by Genno appearing here?

341
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,164
On a checkerboard night

342
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,875
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

343
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,922
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

344
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,259
Suggestively

345
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:45,596
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

346
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,936
The Trombone gradually going off-key

347
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,190
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

348
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:03,281
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

349
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:08,911
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

350
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,317
Students these days,
sure lack civility.

351
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,110
They usually do things like
eat potato chips, eat barbeque...

352
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,862
– Read comics.
– And eat box lunches.

353
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,990
– Is eating all you talk about?
– All that loafing?

354
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,075
Well, I mean
the self study hours are for...

355
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,910
– You know?
– No, I don't know.

356
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,079
They devote themselves to training
even though their Sensei is not watching.

357
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,123
– Isn't it beautiful?
– Really?

358
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,795
I am moved! I will back up
their training myself!

359
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,254
Huh?!

360
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,341
Next time: "The Missed Target"
