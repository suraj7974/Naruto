1
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:20,146
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,483
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,904
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,414
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:45,254
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,219
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,099
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:00,644
Leaving nothing behind,

10
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,106
let us share what is left

11
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,234
In time, we'll realize

12
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:11,280
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,700
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,881
and melting away

17
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,926
That form...?!

18
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:17,847
So that's the extent of
the rumored "Absolute Defense"?

19
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,353
How disappointing.

20
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,950
I see... You were wearing sand, eh?

21
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,160
Your opponent's not just him!

22
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,871
I'm here, too!

23
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,266
Th-That attack just now...

24
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,936
It would've been dangerous
had I not been protected by sand.

25
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,733
M-My body is still...

26
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,945
I'll just be a hindrance like this.

27
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,783
Annoying sand...

28
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,621
You're first, Gaara.

29
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,019
He yanked out his spinal column?!

30
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:55,402
Vengeful Strike:
The Bracken Dance

31
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,619
Dance of the Clematis Flower.

32
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,703
Vine!

33
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,341
Flower!

34
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,140
A bone of the strongest calcification...

35
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,605
It will pierce you,
sand defense and all...

36
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,650
No time...huh?

37
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,327
Ultimate Defense: Shukaku's Shield!

38
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,505
Kabuto...

39
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,341
How much longer will
Kimimaro hold out for?

40
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,845
I think he should still
be okay for a while...

41
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,933
I did all I could with the treatment...

42
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,521
But there's not nearly enough
information about his body.

43
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,776
I think it'd be quite different
if we had something

44
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,862
like the medical history
and treatment data of his clan.

45
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,700
What came out after looking into it

46
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,912
was the bloody history

47
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,709
of how
the Kaguya Clan became just him...

48
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,471
Fools who provoked the great land of
the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle

49
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,182
with just their clan
and were annihilated.

50
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,980
The Kaguya Clan was
a foolish clan that liked battle.

51
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,319
The battlefield was the only place
where they could be at peace.

52
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,739
But it was long ago when
a simple-minded group

53
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,159
that only enjoyed slaughter
was acceptable...

54
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,621
The times are different now.

55
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,625
Doing something like fighting
only with power

56
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,294
against a governed organization
like the Mist...

57
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,632
can only be called an act of fools
rushing towards death.

58
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,054
And then you saved only he
who was the youngest

59
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,475
and the most exceptional
among the Kaguya Clan...

60
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,775
That kid possessed the power that
would be feared even by the fighting clan.

61
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,321
So it seems he was kept
in prison the whole time.

62
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,991
It would've been a waste to let him...die.

63
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,746
Who wouldn't want
that rare Kekkei Genkai?

64
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,333
He possesses a strong
and firm bone structure

65
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,254
and a defensive power to
repel all kinds of physical attacks.

66
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,007
And if turned to offense...

67
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,594
the bones become
a most powerful weapon.

68
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,191
It's because I've fought him once
that I understand this.

69
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,611
That sand shield is
an absolute defense, no less.

70
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,281
And that unusual form...

71
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,283
It'll be okay.
There's no way it'll be broken!

72
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,199
It's hard...

73
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,536
I gathered minerals with
great hardness from the ground,

74
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,123
applied pressure with Chakra
and mixed them into the sand.

75
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,220
You... that unusual Jutsu...

76
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,721
It's the Kekkei Genkai, right?

77
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,891
The Kaguya Clan...

78
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,937
The ability which now
only I possess.

79
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,106
The last one of the clan, eh?

80
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,236
Then it'll die out here today.

81
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,280
Indeed, that might happen.

82
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,369
Due to sickness,
my body will not last so long...

83
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,415
But, the clan will not die out.

84
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,171
Besides I'm not alone.

85
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,309
This is the "Earth" Curse Mark...

86
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,061
With this...

87
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,355
I can become a part of you,
Lord Orochimaru.

88
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,110
Let's get everything, Kimimaro.

89
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,780
And let's see the truth of
this world together.

90
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,283
Yes.

91
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,452
You're my "Vessel of Dreams."

92
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,122
I'm counting on you.

93
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,211
They are presents from me.
I hope you like them.

94
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:03,520
Would you rather...die or obey?

95
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,689
Obey...

96
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,357
You will!

97
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,335
Is this the best a team
of four can do?

98
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,215
I'll ask just once more...

99
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,259
Which would you rather choose?

100
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,142
Very well...

101
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,811
As of now, we're the Sound Ninja Five.

102
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,529
Not alone, you said...?

103
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,073
That's right...

104
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,494
As an existence shouldering
one part of Lord Orochimaru's ambition...

105
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,166
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru's soul...

106
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,210
for all eternity.

107
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,464
Orochimaru's brainwashing, huh...?

108
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,217
You're a pitiful guy.

109
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,357
I used my big moves too much.
I don't have much Chakra.

110
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,817
This is the last of it.

111
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,744
What an amount of Chakra...

112
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,924
You are something...

113
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:05,225
I'll sink and confine you
200 meters into the ground.

114
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,562
By the pressure of the sand
stuck to your body,

115
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,106
you'll soon be unable to move,
not even a finger...

116
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,999
You did it...!
This time for sure you did it.

117
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,551
Dance...

118
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,054
Bracken Dance!

119
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,412
It is annoying...

120
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,291
It feels like a long time

121
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,959
when waiting eagerly for
something you want.

122
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,003
Kabuto...

123
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,632
Stop talking like
you're humoring a child!

124
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,842
I'm sorry...

125
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,389
But you should know
this the most, Lord Orochimaru.

126
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,851
Nobody can beat Kimimaro,

127
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,437
no matter what hindrance
should appear.

128
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,068
Thanks for saving me...

129
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,531
Being able to do something like this;
very impressive.

130
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,951
All I did was ride the sand
I'm always controlling.

131
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,620
You just have to know how you use it.

132
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,875
Lord Orochimaru...

133
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,172
I'm sorry, Lord Orochimaru...

134
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,518
At last... The destruction of
the Leaf will begin...

135
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,605
Third Hokage...
I'll teach you a thing or two.

136
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,537
Sorry to keep you waiting.

137
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,754
What's the matter, Kimimaro?

138
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,592
No... It's nothing.

139
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,732
Even the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village

140
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,068
is no match against us.

141
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,073
Of course...

142
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,077
Kimimaro, it's thanks to you...

143
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,123
Kimimaro!

144
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,543
Kimimaro, so you can't go on, huh?

145
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,548
I'm sorry, Lord Orochimaru.

146
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,811
If I can't be of use...

147
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,691
then there's no significance
to my living.

148
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,489
How is your condition, Kimimaro?

149
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,827
The "Destruction of the Leaf"
resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.

150
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,873
But the Sound Ninja Four
have gone to pick up a new vessel...

151
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,546
Lord Orochimaru's new
"Vessel of Dreams."

152
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,678
Orochimaru's brainwashing, huh...?

153
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,722
You're a pitiful guy...

154
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,101
You're wrong... Far from it!

155
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:21,606
There's no significance to living...

156
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,237
But...you might be able to discover
something interesting

157
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,072
by continuing to live...

158
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,035
Like how you discovered that flower...

159
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,207
Like how I discovered you.

160
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,922
This is the "Earth" Curse Mark!

161
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,218
With this... I can become
a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.

162
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,389
Let's get everything, Kimimaro...

163
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,476
And let's see the truth of
this world together.

164
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,696
I'm going to discover
the truth of this world!

165
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,450
With Lord Orochimaru!

166
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,376
He was a persistent guy,
but this is the end.

167
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,755
He won't ever come out again.

168
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,423
R-Right...

169
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,013
I can't go on...

170
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,973
We're getting off...

171
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,893
It's not brainwashing!

172
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:46,024
That person...
Lord Orochimaru understands me!

173
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,697
What do you guys know?!

174
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,014
He's dead...

175
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,978
Could it be? Has Kimimaro...?

176
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,817
The likes of Kimimaro makes
no difference now...

177
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,490
Sasuke... I can hardly wait for him.

178
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,286
He'll come here even by himself...

179
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,125
I would have been totally hammered.

180
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,962
That's not the case.

181
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,923
My sensei said it often...

182
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,218
Luck is also a part of strength.

183
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,595
That backseat driver?

184
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,430
He's not a backseat driver!

185
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,516
It's because...

186
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,688
I wasn't good enough at that time!

187
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,152
I'm grateful for you saving me.

188
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,865
But please don't talk like that
about my sensei!

189
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,369
You, too...?

190
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,914
When you feel that

191
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,084
the honor of someone you revere
has been hurt,

192
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,129
you yourself are hurt badly
and become enraged.

193
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,464
The more important the person
you revere is to you,

194
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,091
the greater the feeling...

195
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,762
The clan won't die out...
I'm not alone.

196
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:44,142
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru's soul for all eternity.

197
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:49,188
That person,
Lord Orochimaru, understands me!

198
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,941
What do you guys know?!

199
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,988
Fighting for the sake of someone
important to you...

200
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:04,120
He was also the same
as Naruto Uzumaki...

201
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,001
But...the person who is important
to oneself

202
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,712
might not always be "virtuous."

203
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,464
I wonder...

204
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,092
There's no way someone evil
can be thought of as an important person.

205
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,555
No. Even if you know they're "evil"...

206
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,809
People can't defeat solitude...

207
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,119
Sasuke!

208
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,356
For the first time, I spoke to you

209
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,651
And you smiled

210
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,987
For the first time, I was able to speak

211
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,864
In my own words

212
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,495
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

213
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:32,750
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

214
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,756
My clumsy attempts with words

215
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,345
You listened without turning away

216
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

217
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:55,648
But you don't feel anything for me,

218
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,984
do you?

219
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,737
I feel so sad

220
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,821
But...

221
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,198
For the first time, I spoke to you

222
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,452
And you smiled

223
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,829
For the first time, I was able to speak

224
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,082
In my own words

225
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,293
For the first time, I spoke to you

226
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,713
And you smiled

227
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,007
For the first time, I was able to speak

228
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,260
In my own words

229
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,015
For the first time, I spoke to you

230
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,858
You gotta be kidding me!

231
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,152
What do you mean
"for achieving your goal"?!

232
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:45,656
Orochimaru wants you
only as a "vessel"!

233
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,576
There's no way
I can let you go to him!

234
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,578
This is no joke!

235
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:55,083
If you insist on going,

236
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,711
I have to take you back by force!

237
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,464
