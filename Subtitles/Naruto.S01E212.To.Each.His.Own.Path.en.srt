1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,914
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,308
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,936
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,551
Stop that!

15
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,723
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,686
I'm not handing Gantetsu over
to you, no matter what!

17
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,960
That's...

18
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,170
It can't be...!

19
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:14,885
To Each His Own Path

20
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:20,224
You... You mean you ripped
through my net?!

21
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:25,604
I can cut through a weak flimsy net
like that with a single bite!

22
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,069
It's useless! You won't be able to
tear through my Mesh Cage!

23
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,454
I'm gonna have Gantetsu back!

24
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,456
I'm telling you, it's useless!

25
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,170
Damn it! I can't get this thing off!

26
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,298
Here, just die already!

27
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,677
–Naruto!
–Naruto!

28
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,062
You're mine!

29
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,612
Too bad!

30
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,239
So it's you who's gonna die,
after all!

31
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,201
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

32
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,286
Go!

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,665
This is the end for you!

34
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,219
What's that?!

35
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,847
Shura, on the scene!

36
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:49,063
The kid! The kid inside that net
knows where the treasure is!

37
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,903
Good job, Monju!

38
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,452
Akio!

39
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,079
Akio...?!

40
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,376
–Akio! Bro!
–Akio! Bro!

41
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,509
Thank you.

42
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,344
Gantetsu...

43
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,597
I heard you say the name Akio,
just now...

44
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,349
Who in the world is that kid?

45
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,894
That kid... Akio...

46
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:34,024
He's your...
He's your little brother.

47
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,113
Th-That's a lie!

48
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,450
My younger brother...
My younger brother has...

49
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,455
In those flames...

50
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,006
Akio...

51
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,348
You...killed him...!

52
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,433
No!

53
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,060
Gantetsu hasn't killed anybody!

54
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,188
He rescued us! He rescued Akio!

55
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,400
Five years ago.

56
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,614
I had developed a distate for
the Ninja Dropout's way...

57
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,075
I found myself carrying Akio...

58
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,368
Akio!

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,665
Elder brother!

60
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,334
No! You'll inhale smoke!

61
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,466
Damn it!

62
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,305
I thought I could change a little
if I could only save that child.

63
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,350
But that's not what happened!

64
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:57,232
I just continued to create
victims like Akio.

65
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,111
So that's why I started planning
what's happening right now

66
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,280
in order to exterminate
the Ninja Dropouts.

67
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,784
So that's what happened...

68
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,955
–Gantetsu!
–Gantetsu, are you all right?

69
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,916
You're not hurt, are you?

70
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,501
I'm glad you're ok.

71
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,254
They are children from the houses
that the Ninja Dropouts attacked...

72
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,049
Using the money Gantetsu poached
from the gang,

73
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,261
Akio, the oldest, has been
taking care of them.

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,599
Gantetsu is just like
the central figure of a family.

75
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,602
I can't believe this...

76
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,397
You mean that...the kid who
was there just now was...

77
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,268
Akio!!

78
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,660
Where are you going...Gantetsu?!

79
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,455
To the Ninja Dropouts' hideout.

80
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,419
I'm gonna get...Akio back!

81
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,424
I will get Akio back! Your only job
is to guide me there!

82
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,884
Don't interfere!

83
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,595
Todoroki, I understand how you feel.

84
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,431
However, Gantetsu saved Akio
and all these other kids

85
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,058
from the Ninja Dropouts!

86
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,102
Besides, there's something
you should do before that!

87
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,270
Don't mess around with me!

88
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,193
Even so, this guy...Gantetsu...
is a member of the Ninja Dropouts.

89
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,613
The Ninja Dropouts killed my parents!

90
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,617
You're absolutely right.

91
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,952
My own crime will never
be washed away.

92
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,960
As soon as I get Akio back...
you can...do whatever you like to me!

93
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,757
I'm going, too!

94
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,175
Me, too!

95
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,011
Then, Sakura, please look
after the children!

96
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,179
Leave it to me!

97
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,876
Todoroki...

98
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:08,090
I've continued hating that guy
for five years...

99
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,975
What am I supposed to do now...?

100
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,726
Damn it!

101
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,692
In any case, we've got to take care
of your little brother right now!

102
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,859
I know that!

103
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,072
This time for sure...
I'll rescue Akio!

104
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,672
Where did you stash our treasure?!

105
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,176
Where's your hideout?!

106
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,140
Come on! Talk!

107
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,811
I'll never...tell you!

108
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,063
You little brat!

109
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,365
That's the Ninja Dropouts' hideout...

110
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,747
That residence belongs
to Shura, the leader.

111
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,499
I'm pretty sure that's where Akio will be.

112
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,961
Akio...

113
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,551
Oh! Hey! Todoroki! Wait!

114
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,927
Damn!

115
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,066
This ain't good! They'll detect us!

116
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,126
Leaf Hurricane!

117
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,463
Let me handle this situation!

118
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,924
I leave it to you, Bushy-Brows.

119
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,722
Akio!

120
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,890
This way.

121
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,230
I'm pretty sure that Akio is
being tortured in the basement...

122
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,526
That guy was once a Ninja.

123
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,403
There's no telling what
he'll try to do.

124
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,115
I'll go first.

125
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,798
Akio!

126
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,049
W-Wait!

127
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,717
Akio...!

128
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,013
Gantetsu...!

129
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,140
You jerk...!

130
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,433
Don't come over here!

131
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,895
Gantetsu!

132
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,021
Akio!

133
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,940
Hey! Gantetsu!

134
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,114
So only one animal got caught
in the net, huh...?

135
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,615
Shura!

136
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:25,203
He's one stubborn brat.
He never unsealed his lips.

137
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,206
I'll use another method to
get back the treasure.

138
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,126
After I've killed the lot of you!

139
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,902
Naruto, pursue Shura!

140
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,822
We'll be fine! Iron bars
like this are nothing!

141
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,784
Got it!

142
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,204
Todoroki, I'm leaving this
in your hands!

143
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,657
Farewell.

144
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,620
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

145
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,248
Todoroki, you take care of Akio!

146
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,720
Todoroki!

147
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,743
Blood Rain!

148
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:30,013
I won't forgive you...
no matter what!

149
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,556
Rasengan!

150
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,056
So that's what happened...

151
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,602
Gantetsu...
that's how you protected Akio...

152
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,523
Yet I... I...!

153
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,969
Gantetsu! Give me Akio!

154
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,189
Elder brother...
you came to rescue me, after all...

155
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,275
Hang in there, Akio!

156
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,946
My elder brother...
Todoroki, it's really you, isn't it?

157
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,771
This spells the end of the Ninja Dropout.

158
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:43,897
Yeah...

159
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,148
That's right.

160
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,985
But where is Naruto?

161
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,738
Hey!

162
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,326
Naruto Uzumaki! On the scene...!

163
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,709
Naruto! Lee!

164
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,045
Akio!

165
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,631
Akio's back!

166
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,341
It's Akio...!

167
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,177
Are you all right, Akio?!

168
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,261
Yeah...

169
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,180
Oh my gosh, you're hurt!

170
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm fine. It's nothing!

171
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,436
Sakura, could you
take care of his wound?

172
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,896
Leave it to me.

173
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,274
Take care of him.

174
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,243
Apologies for the inconvenience...
Let's head to the capital.

175
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,836
I just cannot forgive you.

176
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,549
But it is true that you rescued Akio.

177
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,054
The Ninja Dropouts
have been annihilated.

178
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,849
Gantetsu got caught up
and died in the fighting

179
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,892
that ensued while being escorted.

180
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,104
Elder brother...

181
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,231
Todoroki...

182
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,739
Yeah! Great! That's great!

183
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,747
You're gonna stay here, right?

184
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,541
Huh?

185
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:31,671
You're gonna stay here with Gantetsu
and the other children, right?

186
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,469
I haven't been a good brother...

187
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,849
But you are an irreplaceable
elder brother for those children.

188
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,643
Elder brother...

189
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,108
What's this...?

190
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,068
This is the souvenir that

191
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,236
I didn't have a chance to
give you back then.

192
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,244
Elder brother... Thank you.

193
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,340
Let's go! Ninja!

194
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,424
Okay!

195
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,927
–Good bye!
–Good bye!

196
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,929
–Take care, everyone!
–See you!

197
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:26,726
–Bye!
–See you!

198
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,451
Hey... How are we gonna
get out of this forest...

199
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,663
without Gantetsu?!

200
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,206
We can't go back now!

201
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,209
We took this path earlier
on too, didn't we...?

202
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,961
I'm starving...

203
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,879
I can't go on.

204
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:01,803
Hey! Somebody rescue us!

205
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,103
The Key to the rusted heart's door

206
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:16,067
Will always be smiling right near by

207
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,327
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

208
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

209
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,545
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

210
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:40,550
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

211
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,346
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

212
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,018
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

213
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:54,397
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

214
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,487
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

215
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,867
The wind is probably testing our hearts

216
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,580
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

217
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:15,334
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

218
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:20,173
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

219
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,719
The Key to the rusted heart's door

220
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:30,558
Will always be smiling right near by

221
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,734
Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?

222
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,445
What? I only brought an injured person
to the hospital.

223
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,572
But to bring an outsider
into the village...

224
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,991
But I'm sure he is not a bad guy at all.

225
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,410
I understand your feelings,
but he has amnesia.

226
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,537
There is a possibility that
he's an enemy spy.

227
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,622
Please, Grandma.

228
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,832
I'll make an exception,
just this one time.

229
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,294
But you will be his keeper, and will be
held accountable for all his actions.

230
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,378
That's all.

231
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,672
Next time: "Vanished Memories"
