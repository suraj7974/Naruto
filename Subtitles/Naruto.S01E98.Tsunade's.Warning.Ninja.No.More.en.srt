1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,846
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,224
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,853
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,450
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,669
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:50,134
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,903
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,782
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,375
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,671
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,896
Tsunade's Warning:
Ninja No More!

21
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,247
Good work, Akamaru!
You nailed it!

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,335
Next, three twists!

23
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,420
Aim carefully!

24
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,472
Can one call that a walk?
No, I don't think one can.

25
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,184
I can't gather insects at ease.

26
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,938
It's so great...

27
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,650
that the three of you have things
you're good at and that you love...

28
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,152
I hope you'll find
something like that too, Hinata.

29
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,572
You're right...

30
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,074
And, what is it?

31
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:39,994
You had something
to tell me, didn't you?

32
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,912
Umm...

33
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:43,998
Yeah...

34
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,918
So, using that as a hint,

35
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,672
think about the fastest way
to get to the destination.

36
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,757
Start!

37
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,688
Everyone!

38
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,983
I'm sorry this happens all the time,
but class is over for today.

39
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,151
Yippee!

40
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,944
– Why?
– Huh? Not again.

41
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,654
The handout is your homework!

42
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,448
– What?!
– Huh?!

43
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,456
I'm so happy we didn't have
the class for Taijutsu.

44
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,501
But these days,
class either finishes in the morning

45
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,337
or we have the whole day off...

46
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,465
I wonder if that's really okay.

47
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,425
What's up with acting like
a serious student?

48
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,385
Right, Konohamaru?

49
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:39,970
Huh?

50
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,227
Konohamaru?

51
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,200
Konohamaru!

52
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,458
What do you think you're doing
with Grandpa's things?!

53
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,919
Honorable grandson...

54
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,296
Those belong to my Grandpa!

55
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,674
Where are you taking them?!

56
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,093
Uh...you mean these?

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,929
They are no longer used,

58
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,682
so I thought I'd put them into storage
in a different location.

59
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,226
No longer used, you say...

60
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,188
You think it's okay to take Grandpa's
things away without permission?!

61
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,483
The Fifth Hokage will be using
the chambers, you know.

62
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,485
The Fifth Hokage?

63
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,529
Y-Yes.

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,615
The next Hokage
has finally been decided.

65
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,034
The village can have peace of mind now.

66
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,205
That person apparently
doesn't smoke tobacco...

67
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,542
What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!

68
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,043
It's too soon for that!

69
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,463
When you depended on
the Old Man up to recently!

70
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,349
What a lovely fragrance...

71
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,603
Huh?!

72
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,857
Wh-What are you doing?!

73
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,568
That's exactly my question for you!

74
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,278
You perverted kid...

75
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,948
I dare you to say that again!

76
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,785
Huh? You want me
to say it again?

77
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,621
Per-vert-ed kid!

78
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,915
Don't call me that!

79
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,292
Lady Tsunade!

80
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,839
The elders are all waiting,
so we had better hurry.

81
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,927
Yes, I know.

82
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,767
Be careful, little boy.

83
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,144
Please be more conscious
of your actions.

84
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,438
I'm the person
who has to deal with the complaints...

85
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,065
Okay, okay.

86
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,736
I'm not a little boy!

87
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,702
Who the heck are you?!

88
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,163
That's my question...

89
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,207
Naruto!

90
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,001
Konohamaru?

91
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,962
Long time no see!

92
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,592
Hey, more importantly, have you seen
a big-boobed, scary old lady...

93
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,844
I mean, young lady?

94
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,305
I did see her!

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,140
– Where did she go?!
– Who the heck is she?!

96
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,102
Who is she?

97
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,651
She has to go
to the hospital straightaway!

98
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,777
Hospital?

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,905
That lady may not look it, but she's
an awesome Medical Corps Ninja!

100
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,659
She finally came back to the village
to become the Hokage, so...

101
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,744
what is she taking her sweet time for?!

102
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,871
Hokage...

103
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,082
The Fifth Hokage.

104
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:01,338
She better do what
she promised to do.

105
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,258
-You're lying...
-Huh?

106
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,135
I don't believe you!

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,137
It's a lie!

108
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,098
What?

109
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,883
There are seven birds within 50 meters
behind me in the direction of the "2."

110
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,679
Tenten...?

111
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,347
Neji!

112
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,812
I just heard that that Lady Tsunade
has returned!

113
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,940
It's the real McCoy.
Wanna go see her?

114
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,693
Sorry.

115
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,862
But I'm not interested.

116
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,447
Huh?

117
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,617
So there were...

118
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,368
eight birds, huh...

119
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,246
Listen carefully, Tsunade.

120
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,498
We must call the feudal lords

121
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,002
and announce the fact that
the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.

122
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,007
We will start preparations today
for the inauguration ceremony in the village.

123
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,761
Feudal lords and ceremonies
are just a big pain.

124
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,012
Tsunade!

125
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,349
Yes, yes, I know...

126
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,227
This is also the job of the Hokage.

127
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:39,978
– Genma!
– Here!

128
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,605
– Aoba!
– Here!

129
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,815
Issue an official notice and

130
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,028
convey this matter to those in the village
within the next few days.

131
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,323
We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.

132
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,699
– Yes, ma'am!
– Yes, ma'am!

133
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,748
I hate you, Grandpa!

134
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,000
Why did you have to die?

135
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,711
The Fifth Hokage...

136
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,388
Gimme a break,
my shoulders are so stiff.

137
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,809
I wish I could just down
a nice cup of hot sake and relax.

138
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,935
Lady Tsunade!

139
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,645
Wait a second!

140
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,190
Before you do that, you have something
else you need to do, Old Lady Tsunade!

141
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,776
What was it?

142
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,528
I told you, didn't I?!

143
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,948
About Kakashi Sensei and
Sasuke and Bushy Brow!

144
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,033
Oh...right, right.

145
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,703
Hey, if it isn't Naruto!

146
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,497
Huh? Shikamaru?

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,250
Why are you in a place like this?

148
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,501
That's my question–

149
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,753
Why are you in a place like this?

150
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,922
I have no idea why,

151
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,841
but my father told me
to come along with him.

152
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,635
What's up with that?

153
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,680
Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.

154
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,807
Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.

155
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,727
Are you taking proper care
of the deer?

156
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,438
The antlers of the deer from
that area make very good medicine.

157
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,481
Yes, I'm somehow managing.

158
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,317
Hey, Naruto, who's that person

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,194
who acts like such
a big shot when she's so young?

160
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,155
That's apparently the new Hokage.

161
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,364
Huh?!

162
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,909
Despite her appearance,
she's an old lady in her fifties.

163
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,036
Yikes!

164
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,289
-Well, see you again sometime.
-Yes, ma'am.

165
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,249
All right, to the hospital!

166
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,336
See you later, Shikamaru.

167
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,838
☺I'm will show you an awesome
new technique I learned!

168
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,716
That's the new Fifth Hokage...?

169
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,218
Hey, Shikamaru.

170
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,766
That person is the strongest
and most beautiful person in the world.

171
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,142
Huh?

172
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,313
I mean, she's the lone female
amongst the Legendary Sannin.

173
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,317
Huh... A female Hokage?

174
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:54,321
I'm not very comfortable with women...

175
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,947
Huh?

176
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,785
Even though they're unusually frank,
they always hang around and

177
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,705
you're never quite sure
whose side they're on.

178
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,169
They always think they can make
men do whatever they want.

179
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,880
Anyway, they're just a pain.

180
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,259
Hey Shikamaru...

181
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,763
Without women,
men wouldn't be born.

182
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,726
If women weren't around,
nothing good would come of men.

183
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,938
No matter how hard-edged
a woman might be,

184
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,732
she'll show her gentle side
to the man she loves.

185
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,611
I can't believe that Pa's saying that...

186
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,571
when he's tied to Mom's apron strings.

187
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,368
You'll understand once
you reach that age.

188
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,370
Oh no!

189
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,248
Let's hurry up and
get our business done...

190
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,084
because Mom will chew us out
if we're late.

191
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,461
Hurry up, Shikamaru!

192
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,798
Looks like nothing will come
of some men

193
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,008
even if they have a woman.

194
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,888
Konoha Hospital

195
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,477
I'm coming in.

196
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,647
Who are you...?

197
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,736
What a beautiful woman...

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,322
Sakura, Sakura!

199
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,824
Everything will be all right now!

200
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,742
I brought along an awesome person.

201
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,830
Sasuke will be fine now!

202
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,416
Naruto...

203
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,631
Those two flowers aren't from
the same day.

204
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,426
So this kid is coming here
every day, huh...

205
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,388
I heard from Guy Sensei...

206
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,974
Please save Sasuke.

207
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,643
OK, leave it to me.

208
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,600
Sasuke!

209
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,893
Sasuke...

210
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,238
Sasuke!

211
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,491
Sasuke, you...!

212
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,854
Hmm, despite his appearance,

213
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,773
that Naruto is pretty considerate.

214
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,024
Huh?

215
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,568
Next! Next!

216
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,447
How disgraceful!

217
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,160
To be taken down by
just two insurgents.

218
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,747
And here I thought you were a genius.

219
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,584
I'm sorry...

220
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,087
All right! Kakashi Sensei's done!

221
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,797
Next, Bushy Brow!

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,383
Please hurry up and
take a look at my disciple Lee!

223
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,929
Lee!

224
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,391
I brought Lady Tsunade here!

225
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,738
That's your disciple?

226
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,450
Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!

227
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,827
I see...

228
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,497
Naruto.
Huh?

229
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,542
Is it really okay for you
to be idling away your time here like this?

230
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,127
Uh, I almost forgot!

231
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,796
I had an appointment to
meet Iruka Sensei!

232
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,173
Go on!

233
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,301
OK! I'll leave the rest in your hands!

234
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,510
All right!

235
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,308
Hey, Naruto!

236
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,268
You're late, Iruka Sensei!

237
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,645
Sorry, sorry.

238
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,272
There were lots of things to do
with respect to the Fifth Hokage.

239
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,650
I guess...

240
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,072
Thanks for waiting!

241
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,865
I'm digging in!

242
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,996
-Naruto.
-Huh...?

243
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,250
You have really developed compared
to the time when you wanted this.

244
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,212
I have, haven't I?
You think so too, right?

245
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,674
This headband that I received
from Iruka Sensei

246
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,676
suits me perfectly, don't you think?

247
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,847
Stop being so cocky!

248
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,141
You still have a long,
long way to go!

249
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,268
You have lots of work to do!

250
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,397
Listen carefully, Naruto!

251
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,483
The Leaf Village is in
a very difficult situation right now.

252
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,279
Starting with the Third Hokage,
we lost many fine Shinobi.

253
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,574
The current strength of the Leaf
is less than half what it normally is.

254
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,660
Despite that, we must continue
to carry out our missions.

255
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,328
Why is that?

256
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,622
If you don't have enough manpower,
you should turn it down.

257
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,790
No, that won't do...

258
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,251
If we turn down our missions,

259
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,671
it would be like announcing
to other countries our weakened state.

260
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,050
Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing
will probably be assigned to missions.

261
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,053
I see...these are difficult times.

262
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,390
Hey! This concerns you too!

263
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,726
You need to play an active role

264
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,103
and carry out your duties
in order to aid Lady Tsunade.

265
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,649
Yeah. But, before I do that,
I need to satisfy my stomach.

266
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,611
That's just like you.

267
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,451
Do your best!

268
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,122
Seconds!

269
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,040
Hey, hey!
How'd you finish so fast?!

270
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,547
I'll be straight with you.

271
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,091
Give up being a Shinobi.

272
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:47,692
L-Lady Tsunade...
don't joke like that.

273
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:53,031
There are numerous bone fragments
in the area around important nerves.

274
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,700
Moreover, they are deeply embedded.

275
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,789
You're not physically capable
of carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.

276
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,293
Come now, Lady Tsunade,
don't joke like that...

277
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,545
Even if I were to operate...

278
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,172
Don't be fooled, Lee!

279
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,508
That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!

280
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,511
You changed yourself
using the Transformation Jutsu,

281
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,762
you evil woman!

282
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,555
Who the heck are you?!

283
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,447
Don't I have any...chance?

284
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,618
There is no one besides me
who is capable of doing the surgery

285
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,787
and it would take too much time.

286
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,456
Furthermore, there is a huge risk...

287
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,500
Risk?

288
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,712
The probability of
a successful surgery is 50% at best,

289
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,048
and if it fails...

290
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,093
You'll die.

291
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,648
Guy Sensei!

292
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,734
I'm not at all ready
to throw in the towel!

293
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:19,409
Guy Sensei, what's this god-awful
bitter rice dumpling?

294
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,871
They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.

295
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,874
If you eat one hundred of them,
they should heal your wound.

296
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,459
I see, if I don't eat
one hundred of them,

297
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,295
my wound won't heal, right?

298
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,759
N-Not in a single day!

299
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,222
It's better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.

300
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,017
Lee...

301
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,794
Lee...

302
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,401
If I knew this was going to happen,
I shouldn't have brought you to him.

303
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,111
Don't say that...!

304
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,490
I am painfully aware of how you feel,

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,076
but it's better to be clear.

306
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,245
Because it's something he'll have
to understand sooner or later.

307
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,582
The longer we wait...

308
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,710
the harder it will be for him.

309
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,061
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

310
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

311
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,736
On your still shoulder

312
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:24,575
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

313
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

314
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

315
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,799
"Each one of us

316
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

317
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,473
you say laughingly

318
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:53,563
but you look most dazzling

319
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,984
Like a comet,

320
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:04,282
like the rainbow after the storm

321
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:11,372
You bring light into my heart

322
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost

323
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,966
can be the answer

324
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:30,266
Let's promise we won't cheat

325
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,937
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

326
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,735
Konohamaru, just come out
from there already!

327
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,028
Shut up!

328
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,155
Listen, I'll treat you to
a bowl of ramen!

329
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,281
Don't want any!

330
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,452
OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.

331
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,870
You're such a pest!

332
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,622
What did you just say?!

333
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,208
In that case,
I'll pull you out by force!

334
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,626
Be ready for that!

335
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,962
Next time:
"The Will of Fire Still Burns!"

336
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,798
Don't miss it!
