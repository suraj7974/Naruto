1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,873
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,308
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,936
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,973
The Bewildering Forest

15
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:49,485
Hey kids, get out of here
if you don't wanna get hurt.

16
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,903
Better not think lightly of me!

17
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,948
I'm not gonna hand this guy over,
no matter what!

18
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,367
Ninja Dropouts...

19
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,203
It's not gonna end up with
you just getting hurt.

20
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,121
You're gonna get killed.

21
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,499
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,813
Ninja Art: Blood Rain.

23
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,237
Todoroki!

24
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,032
Damn!

25
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,303
My Jutsu isn't Ninjutsu.

26
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,139
It's Killer Jutsu.

27
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,774
Sakura!

28
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,201
Lee, are you all right?

29
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:25,372
Yeah, just barely.
More importantly, where's Naruto?

30
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,211
Is everybody safe?

31
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,715
Yes. However, Commander Todoroki
is nowhere to be seen!

32
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,091
What was that?!

33
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,385
Naruto...

34
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,180
Naruto...

35
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,691
Die!

36
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,363
Damn! Let go, you jerk!

37
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,990
Naruto!

38
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,595
Damn!

39
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,922
Father! Mother!

40
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,352
Akio!

41
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,191
Akio!

42
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,096
What a shame...

43
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,224
You're not getting back
with your comrades.

44
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,162
Todoroki! Gantetsu!

45
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,330
Are you all right?!

46
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,417
Y-Yeah... We're fine.

47
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,087
What are we going to do now?

48
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,298
We've gotten separated from
Sakura and Bushy Brows...

49
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,841
There isn't any question in my mind.

50
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,386
It's my mission to deliver
this guy to the capital.

51
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,389
But the ship's been destroyed, and...

52
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,822
Those guys are pursuing us!

53
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,491
What are you doing?!

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,369
If they're gonna steal this guy
away from us anyway,

55
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,665
it would be better to
take care of him right here!

56
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,378
What do you mean take care of him...?

57
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,839
Even if we delivered him the capital,

58
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,674
it's certain that
he'll be sentenced to death...

59
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,300
Therefore...

60
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,512
Rather than having them
take him away, it would be better to...!

61
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,306
It's not set in stone that
they'll be able to take him away!

62
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,391
Let's go!

63
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,606
Your mission is to guard this guy, right?

64
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,150
That's exactly what my mission is too!

65
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,164
If you so much as try anything,
your head's gonna roll!

66
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,004
Run!

67
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,520
We'll be fine...
now that we've come this far...

68
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,693
Looks like we've totally lost them.

69
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,697
We've gone pretty deep
into the forest, haven't we?

70
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,159
I can get our bearings from
the position of the moon.

71
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,661
It's too dangerous to go back
to the river.

72
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,623
We'll continue straight through
this forest to the capital.

73
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,753
Because it's my mission.

74
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,088
Are you sure it'll be okay?

75
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,090
What do you mean?

76
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,428
You said earlier you were going
to finish this guy off, right?

77
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,848
I was talking about
a worst-case scenario.

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,268
Got it...
Well then, let's get moving.

79
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,776
I wonder if Sakura is all right...

80
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,781
Naruto...

81
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,743
It's Naruto...
He's gonna be just fine.

82
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,994
Yeah...

83
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,747
So let's hurry up and link up with him!

84
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,582
Lee!

85
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,587
I detect something strange...

86
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,755
Where...?

87
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,511
Up above!

88
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,527
Lee!

89
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,239
Let's follow him!
The enemy might have captured Naruto!

90
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
What's the matter?

91
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,509
We're walking in the direction
of the moon, right...?

92
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,139
Then why is the moon following us?

93
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,559
That's strange...

94
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,858
What's going on...?

95
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,068
The Forest of Bewilderment...

96
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,573
Once you get lost you can
never find you way out again.

97
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,992
He talked...

98
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,911
You are in custody.
You're not allowed to talk!

99
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,663
Wait a second!

100
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,832
The Forest of Bewilderment...

101
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,834
You know something about this place?

102
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,003
What do you know? Tell us!

103
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,424
The Ninja Dropouts have
a hide-out in this forest.

104
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,884
What was that?!

105
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:39,348
So we were escorting you
through Ninja Dropout territory...?!

106
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,894
This forest is perfect for a hide-out.

107
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,730
The fog, the winds that
sweep through the forest,

108
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,231
the extreme magnetic fields...

109
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,734
They all make a person lose
their sense of direction.

110
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,402
A person finding himself in
this forest for the first time

111
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,488
will never find his way out.

112
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,947
I don't believe that...

113
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,450
There's no way we won't find
our way out...?

114
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,078
-You guys won't.
-Huh?

115
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,623
But for me, a member of
the Ninja Dropouts...

116
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,541
the outcome will be different.

117
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,052
I will...

118
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,722
I will guide you through this forest.

119
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,643
Yeah, that's right...

120
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,730
For you, a Ninja Dropout,
this forest is like your backyard, right?

121
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,817
Okay then, let's have you guide us!

122
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,443
Are you some kind of idiot?!

123
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,404
It's true...

124
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,697
The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts
showed earlier on

125
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,992
makes sense if you think
that this is their garden...

126
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,497
And I'll believe you when you say
you have a hide-out here.

127
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,915
Then even more so...

128
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,459
-Even more so, it's a no!
-Huh...?

129
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,836
Don't you get it?

130
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,213
This guy is gonna pretend to
be guiding us out of the forest

131
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,132
but will actually be taking us
to the hide-out.

132
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,428
Todoroki...

133
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,096
This is an emergency situation...

134
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,683
If we don't kill him, we'll be killed.

135
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,351
W-Wait a minute!

136
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,729
Nobody's gonna care...if this guy dies!

137
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,615
Todoroki!

138
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,829
What's that...?

139
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,543
I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts
had stolen up to now...

140
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,005
So I was tortured...

141
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,633
Those guys don't want to rescue me...

142
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,511
They just want to get that money
back from me.

143
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,558
Once they have the money back,
those guys will kill me too.

144
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,187
Do you really think I'll believe that?

145
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,813
Wait a second!

146
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,192
The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is
here in this forest, right...?

147
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,527
Which means it's like
a backyard to them too,

148
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,945
just like it is for Gantetsu...

149
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,989
Which means that...

150
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,657
Which means that what?

151
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:09,581
Well, since we've trespassed
into their garden

152
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,584
it's likely that the Ninja Dropouts
will come after us

153
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,337
whether Gantetsu's
betrayed them or not...

154
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,592
So I think our only option is to
pin our hopes on this guy...

155
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,222
Am I wrong?

156
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,763
Hey, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

157
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,598
Yeah, everything's fine.

158
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,935
Those guys won't figure out
this kind of circuitous route.

159
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,938
Can we really trust this guy...?

160
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,712
What?!

161
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,676
I'm used to it's venom. It's nothing.

162
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,015
Are you really gonna be all right?

163
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,099
Yeah...

164
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,748
Hey!

165
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,167
What's the matter?

166
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,429
No way!

167
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,989
You fell for it. You fell for it!

168
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,914
Here it comes!

169
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,585
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!

170
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,629
Die!

171
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,858
You're the one who fell for it!

172
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,571
I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.

173
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,198
What was that?!

174
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,075
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

175
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,914
Now it's my turn!

176
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,085
Rasengan!

177
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,611
I'm gonna strike you down!

178
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,826
Don't think it's gonna be that
easy to strike me down!

179
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,327
Like I'll let you get away!

180
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,954
Naruto!

181
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,461
That guy! Trying to get away, huh!

182
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,778
What are you doing?

183
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,209
Th-That sound is...

184
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,763
What?!

185
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,724
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

186
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,355
Rasengan!

187
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,789
Thanks to you we made it...Gantetsu.

188
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,042
What's with you guys?

189
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,336
They want to fight, it seems.

190
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,353
I won't... I won't be fooled.
You...you...

191
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,275
We'll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.

192
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,842
Todoroki!

193
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,942
Stop it, Todoroki!

194
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,779
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?

195
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,490
This guy...

196
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,117
There's no way I'll forgive this guy!

197
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,953
What are you talking about?!

198
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,829
This guy...

199
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:52,919
This guy killed my family...
he killed my little brother!

200
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,964
Wh-What was that...?

201
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,386
Gantetsu...

202
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,061
The Key to the rusted heart's door

203
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:16,109
Will always be smiling right near by

204
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,494
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

205
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,957
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

206
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,670
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

207
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:40,466
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

208
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,513
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

209
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,976
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

210
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:54,188
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

211
00:21:54,272 --> 00:22:01,070
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

212
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,825
The wind is probably testing our hearts

213
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,621
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

214
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:15,251
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

215
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,881
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

216
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:24,635
The Key to the rusted heart's door

217
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:30,349
Will always be smiling right near by

218
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,776
It's true that Gantetsu may be evil,

219
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,696
but how is taking revenge out
on him going to change things?!

220
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,408
Isn't our mission to take Gantetsu
to the capital?

221
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,371
And I... I don't think that
he's an evil person.

222
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,793
Anyway, you leave me
no choice if you won't listen.

223
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,754
I'll stop you with all my strength!

224
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,799
Next time: "Memory of Flames"
