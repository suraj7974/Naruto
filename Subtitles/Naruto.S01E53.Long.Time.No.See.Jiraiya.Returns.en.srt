1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,482
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,486
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,378
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,839
Now

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through
life, squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,896
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,948
If you're not the one

17
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,784
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:20,539
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,811
Hey... Closet pervert.

20
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,440
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu...

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,984
One Thousand Years of Death!

22
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:57,368
He's totally knocked
out... He's weak, sure enough.

23
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:02,957
What's with that big
frog? What the heck are you?

24
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,754
Thank you for asking me!

25
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,842
Know me as the Mountain Toad...
spirit sage who acquires immortality,

26
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,345
also commonly called
the Toad Mountain Sage.

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,726
Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!

28
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,396
M-Mountain Sage?

29
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,730
Exactly.

30
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,407
Hey...Pervy Sage,
what're you going to do about this?

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,993
Here, he was
supposed to watch my training.

32
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,370
You did that to him.

33
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,707
He interfered with my research.

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,083
Research?

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:51,338
I'm a writer. I'm writing a novel.
This is it.

36
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,633
MAKE-OUT PARADISE

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,391
Oh, that is...!

38
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,602
You know this?

39
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,522
I've gotten quite famous.

40
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,983
That's not much of a novel!

41
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,652
In the first place,
what research you are talking about?

42
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,113
You're just peeking at the girls' bath!

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,823
– Yikes!
– No!

44
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,870
Idiot, idiot...idiot! My
peeking has been found out.

45
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,413
You pervert.

46
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,292
F-Fool! I'm not just a pervert.

47
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,546
I get inspired by peeking
and can write better pieces.

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,466
Liar! No excuses.

49
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,344
More importantly,
what're you going to do about my training?

50
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:43,807
You mean the walking-on-water
technique you were doing earlier?

51
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,267
You know it?

52
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,647
Then take responsibility
and join my training.

53
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,691
Humph. I don't care about such things.

54
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,612
Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!

55
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,615
Join my training, hey!

56
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:05,412
Shut up! I hate people
who don't know how to talk properly...

57
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,624
And I don't like men.

58
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,502
Oh, umm, umm...

59
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:16,590
That Make-Out Paradise was
really exciting, cool and interesting.

60
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:20,970
The purchase or viewing of that novel is
prohibited for those 18 years or younger...

61
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,346
You liar.

62
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,099
The reviews that I've heard are great.

63
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,727
It's useless to flatter me. I'm a sage!

64
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:33,315
I'm not the type of fool
who can be coaxed by a fledgling like you.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,736
Oh, hey...wait!

66
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,242
Farewell, kid.

67
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:49,832
Wow! He's cool even though he's a pervert.

68
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,843
Heeey, Pervy Sage!

69
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,264
Where'd he go?

70
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,857
What're you doing, you old pervert?

71
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,112
No, no, I'm sorry, miss...

72
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:24,199
but what lovely breasts...

73
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,659
Pervert!

74
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,167
This grown-up is disgraceful.

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,544
Maybe there's nothing
special about him, after all.

76
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,255
But there's nobody else.

77
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,675
Good grief...

78
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
As usual, the women in
this village are strong-minded.

79
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,764
However, that's makes them so good.

80
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,767
"As usual"? Meaning
you've come here before?

81
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,727
You.

82
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,313
And you did nothing but peeping, right...?

83
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,939
You Pervy Sage!

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,735
Don't say pervert,
pervert in such a loud voice.

85
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,070
Shut up!

86
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,531
So I bet that one shot on
the closet pervert was a fluke...

87
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:09,995
Anyway, I'll have you take responsibility
for ruining my training!

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,163
Whoa...

89
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,207
Jeez, you're a noisy brat.

90
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,333
Hey!

91
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,504
Be quiet inside here for awhile.

92
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:24,468
Hey! Let me out, you jerk!

93
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:38,190
I want to have a romantic
encounter with a stacked girl.

94
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,760
How dare you do that to me earlier!

95
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,973
Substitution Jutsu.

96
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,309
Sure enough, he's not an ordinary old man.

97
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,570
Humph! That punk...

98
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,699
It's a million years too
soon for that kid to take me on.

99
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,827
Not really.

100
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,292
It seems you have a bit of talent.

101
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,586
Then you'll watch my training?

102
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,171
Give and take!

103
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,423
I'm not averse to listening to your favor

104
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,969
as long as you listen to mine.

105
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,053
So which is it?

106
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:56,185
Listen up... Nice ripe fruit
that looks like this,

107
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,687
like this and this.

108
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,524
I'll watch
your training if you bring me that.

109
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,650
You really will, right?

110
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,069
This Toad Mountain Sage doesn't lie.

111
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,280
Okay, wait!

112
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,378
Plans are plans. They don't
necessarily have to happen...

113
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,507
Hello there, you ladies!

114
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,187
Oh my... You're funny, old man.

115
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,358
No-no, this is the solemn truth.

116
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,401
Yeah, and then, what happened then?

117
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,154
Hey, Pervy Sage!

118
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,615
Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.

119
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:56,286
You fool! Who's a Pervy Sage?

120
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,955
I brought the promised item.

121
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,666
Nice ripe fruit..

122
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,047
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! That's not IT!

123
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,263
Looks good!

124
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,182
Don't hesitate. Help yourself.

125
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,642
Thanks.

126
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,980
No! Where'd the ladies go?!

127
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,195
I got my fill...

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,156
Ladies...

129
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,245
No doubt about it. That person is...

130
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,876
Good grief. I've wasted time...

131
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:50,841
Hold it! Where are
you going?! What about my training?!

132
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,387
I don't care! My precious
research has been ruined thanks to you.

133
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,977
Research, my butt! I can't
be standing around here, either!

134
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,938
I'm going to train hard,
become stronger than anybody,

135
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,690
pass the Chunin exam,

136
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,693
and then I'll exceed the Hokage!

137
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,614
Humph! I don't care about such things.

138
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,616
Here all you do is get in my way...

139
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,660
Jeez, what a repugnant brat!

140
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,163
Stacked girls like the ones from earlier

141
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,375
are indispensable for
my great writing enterprises!

142
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,339
I see... So I should
bring some stacked girls, right?

143
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,757
Okay.

144
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,832
W-Wow...!

145
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,795
If you gaze at me like
that... I feel embarrassed.

146
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,757
Oh...!

147
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,718
What a...

148
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,471
What a cute girl.

149
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,473
I like you!

150
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,184
You pass!

151
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,478
Idiot.

152
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:33,235
You're really my type of
girl. What's that technique called?

153
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,072
It's called Sexy Jutsu.

154
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:42,202
Oooh, what an idea. You're a genius.

155
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,831
I get the feeling all adults are
really affected by this technique.

156
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,042
Then you'll watch my training?

157
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,670
Sure! However, I have a condition.

158
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,841
A condition...? What is it?

159
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,189
A-Always be...in
that form when you're in front of me!

160
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,447
Hey! Sure enough,
you're just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!

161
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,158
No! I'm not just a pervert!

162
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,410
As if you didn't know!

163
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,373
I'm a super pervert!

164
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,669
Darn it... He's gone defiant...

165
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,261
Well, brushing off
the stuff until now as a joke,

166
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,888
I'll watch your training.

167
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,140
You mean it, right?

168
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,059
A sage doesn't go back on his word.
Okay, kid.

169
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:51,897
Do that training
that you were doing before one more time.

170
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,065
Okay!

171
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,155
Okay.

172
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,729
Darn it.

173
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,777
Totally worthless.

174
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,739
Shut up! It's pointless to wear clothes.

175
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,867
Hey, build up your Chakra one more time.

176
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,452
One more time?

177
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,079
Just do it, quick.

178
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,507
You!
What?

179
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,344
You're pretty sexy when you're naked.

180
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,807
Jeez. I'm
concentrating, so don't interfere.

181
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,935
Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.

182
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,395
You're messing with my focus.

183
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:39,796
I see...So this is The Seal Formula.

184
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,884
Two Tetragram Seals
making a Double Tetragram Seal...

185
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,178
Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?

186
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,724
Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking
from between the Tetragram Seals...

187
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,768
and is fixed so
that it can return to this kid's Chakra.

188
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,521
Fourth Hokage...

189
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,983
It's to protect this kid, huh?

190
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,323
But after that, it's
stopped with a Five-Pronged Seal...

191
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,576
Putting Odd-Numbered Seal
over Even-Number Seals...

192
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,747
This kid's Chakra and that of the
Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled

193
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,498
and are not stable.

194
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,170
No wonder he is not able
to build up Chakra very well.

195
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,635
That tickles...old man.

196
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,012
Oh, sorry, sorry.

197
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,807
Perhaps someone else...did it...

198
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,225
The formula is rough.

199
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,021
Well, it's probably Orochimaru.

200
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,531
Kid, give me a hurrah.
What?

201
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,701
Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.

202
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,624
Jeez, he's demanding.

203
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,254
Five-Pronged Seal...Release!

204
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,402
What're you doing?!

205
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,364
Well, I just pushed
the pressure points for relaxing.

206
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,159
Just try walking on the water once more...

207
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,953
Sheesh!

208
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,795
What?

209
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:55,098
I don't know why, but it's going well!

210
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,183
Yahoo!

211
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,817
I guess it's about time to teach him
how to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.

212
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,861
Okay, kid. Come on out.

213
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,489
I'll teach you an ace technique.

214
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,784
What, what ace
technique? A deadly technique?

215
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,087
There's something
you need to understand well

216
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,340
before I teach you techniques.

217
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:34,596
You probably haven't noticed,
but you possess two types of Chakra.

218
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,514
Huh? Two types?

219
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,185
Until now, have
you ever felt a special Chakra?

220
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,146
Special? Hmm...

221
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,066
Come to think of it...

222
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:52,238
Come to think of it,
I get the feeling there were times when...

223
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:57,702
Chakra suddenly sprang up
and an awesome power came out.

224
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:02,582
But...I don't really remember those moments.

225
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,167
I see.

226
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,544
But I do remember
sensing that it was different

227
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,339
from the Chakra I always build up.

228
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,174
If I liken it to colors,

229
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,803
while it's always blue...

230
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,014
it felt like it was red or something.

231
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,766
I see.

232
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,823
Okay. That's it for today's training.

233
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,407
What?! Already?

234
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,284
What happened to the ace technique?

235
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,328
I can still train.

236
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,539
With training, a watched pot never boils.

237
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,042
As long as we're here, let's have a bath...

238
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,837
Not just falling in...

239
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,144
Warms me up.

240
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,109
A drink after training's the best.

241
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,444
Say, say, Pervy Sage.

242
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,572
What kind of
technique is that ace technique?

243
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,574
You'll find out tomorrow.

244
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,367
Miser!

245
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,007
We'll turn into boiled
frogs if we stay in here too long.

246
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:06,122
Ebisu, sorry for snatching your student.

247
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,248
It's okay.

248
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,626
More importantly, I was surprised...

249
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,087
The Hokage has had
us searching all over for you

250
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,924
and we could never
determine your whereabouts.

251
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,927
To think you were in this village...

252
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,012
The Hokage will be pleased.

253
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,099
Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?

254
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,893
Not yet.

255
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,647
I see. That's for the best.

256
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,398
Sure enough, something about Orochimaru?

257
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,610
No, unfortunately not.

258
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,861
What?

259
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,823
I just stopped by looking
for material for my novel...

260
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,619
My nature is not to get
myself involved in trouble.

261
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,831
What are you saying?! You should know!

262
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,085
What is necessary to stop
Orochimaru, known as one of the Sannin,

263
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,753
the legendary three Shinobi,

264
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,297
is the power of another Sannin!

265
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,967
Your power, Master Jiraiya!

266
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,316
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

267
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,778
Two! He kisses and hugs
everyone randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

268
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,281
Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry

269
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,660
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

270
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:32,041
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

271
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,545
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

272
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,716
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

273
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,146
One! Bodimahattaya-san
devotes his time for digging black ships

274
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,733
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

275
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,194
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

276
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,448
Four! Japanese
people, now lend me you hand!

277
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:09,370
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

278
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,291
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

279
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,919
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

280
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:23,301
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

281
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,929
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

282
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,975
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

283
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,817
First, I need to
sign this contract in blood

284
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,862
and mark it with
the fingerprints of one hand.

285
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,699
Then I build up my Chakra.

286
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,285
The Hand Signs are
Dog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

287
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,955
Then I must place my contract hand
on the place where I want to summon it!

288
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,375
How's that?!

289
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:01,047
Next time, "The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!"

290
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,008
What is this?!
