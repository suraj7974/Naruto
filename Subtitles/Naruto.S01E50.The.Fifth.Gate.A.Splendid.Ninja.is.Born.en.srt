1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,295
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,131
Now

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,645
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,748
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:36,430
There is no way that I alone can
lose in a place like this!

19
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,600
Guy Sensei...please allow it.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,477
It is now...

21
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,657
A time to carry through and protect
one's own Way of the Ninja!

22
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:00,663
The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born

23
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,541
The color of his body changed...!

24
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,961
He's red...?!

25
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,262
What's up with him...?!

26
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,685
He's opened the third gate,
the Gate of Life...

27
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,813
He's going to make his move!
No, not yet!

28
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,897
What?!

29
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,902
And also,

30
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,698
the fourth gate,
the Gate of Pain...open!

31
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,164
What an incredible guy...

32
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,209
It's not as though effort alone
can make this happen...

33
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,711
That boy...

34
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,921
is he in fact a genius...?

35
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,475
He's fast!

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,606
Gaara!
Where are they?!

37
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,233
He's above!

38
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,823
But we can't find Lee!

39
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,033
Where?!

40
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,751
The sand isn't keeping up at all!

41
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,968
So it's the Sand Armor again...?

42
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,889
Then how's this?!

43
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,942
What...?!

44
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,361
This Sand Armor is...

45
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,698
being peeled away...!

46
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,285
You're a stubborn one.

47
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,205
Since it comes to this...

48
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,212
The muscles have torn...

49
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,217
Is that really Lee...?

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,885
When did he become like this...?

51
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,140
This is the end!

52
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,520
The Fifth Gate of Closing...open!

53
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,065
I can't defend myself...

54
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,235
Is this the movement of
a human being?!

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,278
Neji...

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,949
This technique is my ace in
the hole to take you down...

57
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,910
but I will specially show it to you!

58
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,789
Huh?!

59
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,473
The Sand Shield can't keep up!

60
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,268
Most of the armor has also
been peeled off...

61
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,602
He's done for!

62
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,187
W-Wow!

63
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,024
Hidden Lotus... In other words...

64
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,193
it's a high-speed continuous
Taijutsu that can't even be touched!

65
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,905
The answer to take Neji down is
that high speed combination...

66
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,408
There is no way that
the sand can keep up!

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,702
This technique will be the last!

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,501
Hidden Lotus!

69
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,263
I can't see anything, it's too fast...

70
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,151
That's impossible...

71
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,403
The gourd has turned to sand...?

72
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,497
He's done it this time!

73
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,581
Gaara!

74
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,708
Lee...

75
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh!

76
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,549
What's...that?

77
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,942
He protects himself...

78
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,903
using a gourd made of sand?!

79
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,550
That technique is...!

80
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,469
Sand Coffin!

81
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,402
No way!

82
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,195
He got hit by the Hidden Lotus

83
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,739
and is still able to bring
forth a technique...!

84
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,918
Sand Coffin!

85
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,554
I just can not lose in a place like this...

86
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,391
I want to...

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,643
my Way of the Ninja...

88
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,864
Oh no!

89
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,365
Die!

90
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,783
Why...?

91
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,705
Why...save him?

92
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,668
He's...

93
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,172
I'm all right!

94
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,674
I'm strong so...

95
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,009
The Chunin Exam...

96
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,428
Guy Sensei, please watch
me with a smile...

97
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,598
I'd like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja

98
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,851
even though I can't use Ninjutsu!

99
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,896
That would be the ultimate for me!

100
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,190
He is...

101
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:33,073
an important subordinate
whom I care for!

102
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,379
A subordinate...whom I care for...?

103
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,843
Those words are definitely
not understandable to Gaara...

104
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,476
I quit...

105
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,022
He quit...?

106
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,276
The moment Guy jumped in,
Lee lost.

107
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,197
The winner...

108
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,407
Gaa-!

109
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,326
– Wha...?
– Huh?

110
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,577
– Huh?
– Huh?

111
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,120
Wha...?!

112
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,507
That's impossible...

113
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,360
Having opened the fifth gate...

114
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,737
And his hand and feet are crushed...

115
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,655
There's no way he should
be able to stand...!

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,201
Lee...

117
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,410
It's all right.

118
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,828
It's over!

119
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,039
You're in no condition to stand...!

120
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,211
Lee...

121
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,671
Y-You...

122
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,425
You are...

123
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,061
Even after having
lost consciousness...

124
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,690
You still want to prove your
own Way of the Ninja...?

125
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,279
So he had already...

126
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,449
lost consciousness...

127
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,453
Lee...

128
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,957
You're already...

129
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,924
a respectable Ninja...!

130
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,388
The winner...

131
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,472
Gaara.

132
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,821
Lee!

133
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,947
Stop!

134
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,993
Even if you went down
what could you do?

135
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:32,461
Your words of encouragement
would only make him feel worse.

136
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,435
There's no way he could
have beaten Gaara...

137
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,359
He was faced with a tougher battle
than we thought...

138
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,742
That Naruto...

139
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,419
Bushy Brow lost
to a guy like this...!

140
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,757
Medics, please hurry.

141
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,932
Bushy Brow...

142
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,105
Lee...

143
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,546
You are the Jonin in charge of him,
aren't you?

144
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,923
Y-Yes.

145
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,592
Please come with me
for a minute.

146
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,057
Careful...

147
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,809
Don't shake him.

148
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,325
There is faint breathing...

149
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,413
but because of comminuted fractures
and muscle tears to his entire body,

150
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,375
recovery will likely to take
quite some time...

151
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,214
If that was all, it wouldn't be so bad, but...

152
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:50,140
The damage to the left arm
and leg which received the attack is severe...

153
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,058
It's too severe...

154
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,268
Oh...!

155
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,402
I don't want to say this,

156
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,700
but he won't be able to...
live as a Shinobi again.

157
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,130
T-That...

158
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,299
that can't be true...

159
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,510
I will take Bushy Brow down.
Believe it!

160
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,973
It is not you whom I want to fight,
it's Uchiha!

161
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,226
You...!

162
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,396
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

163
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,275
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!

164
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,613
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort...

165
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,240
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

166
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,620
Though, I am probably going
to be the one fighting Neji...

167
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,541
Lee...

168
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:04,297
I didn't want to think...that you'd lose.

169
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,008
I wanted to let you fulfill...

170
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,804
your Way of the Ninja!

171
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,014
Yay!

172
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,724
I finally mastered it!

173
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,685
Yahoo!

174
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,269
This technique...

175
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,481
after all, only Lee managed to master...

176
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:26,027
Okay, you became Genin
from today.

177
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,197
I want to hear what it is
you all are aiming for!

178
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:35,328
I-I'd like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

179
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,998
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

180
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,042
That would be the ultimate for me!

181
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,505
Please forgive me for not...

182
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,633
stopping it...!

183
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,386
Lee...

184
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,808
It's not true...it's not true.

185
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,688
After hearing that,
what should Bushy Brow do...?!

186
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,190
This guy...

187
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:09,154
He said the failure would take
down a genius with effort...!

188
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,865
Isn't there something that
can be done?!

189
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,617
Calm down, Naruto.

190
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,121
B-But...Kakashi Sensei!

191
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,292
He kept saying he wanted
to battle Sasuke and Neji!

192
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,712
Perhaps...that led to his ruin.

193
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,674
To fulfill that dream...

194
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,886
the boy even used a self-sacrificing
forbidden technique to try to win!

195
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,103
The result is what you see...

196
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,693
That boy...

197
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,403
Sasuke and Neji...

198
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,197
and you...

199
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,284
he sacrificed himself to
a promise he never spoke of.

200
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,037
He risked his life...

201
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,582
so that he might have
a chance to battle you guys...

202
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,757
Don't forget that...

203
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,683
I wonder if Lee...

204
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,310
will be all right...?

205
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,566
Lee...

206
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,820
You didn't realize it even at the end...

207
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,156
Heaven does not allow it.

208
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,992
One who tries to move ahead
while achieving victory

209
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,914
through a method like dying
upon each other's swords.

210
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,684
So it ended without incident...

211
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,270
Welcome back Gaara.

212
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,331
Guy...

213
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,583
Well...

214
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,710
I spoke self-importantly earlier but...

215
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,840
I've thought about it and
had I been in your position...

216
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,970
I probably...wouldn't have
been able to stop him.

217
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,810
Guy.

218
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,689
We're in the way of the
next tournament...let's go up.

219
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,068
All right...

220
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:04,704
Then, the tenth and final round is next,
both contestants come forward!

221
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,834
So it's finally my turn...

222
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,758
I'm gonna win and have
some barbecued beef!

223
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:22,305
In any case, I need to last until
the main tournament and battle Sasuke.

224
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:27,852
Or I will not have met your expectations,
Lord Orochimaru...

225
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,272
I can almost see through it...

226
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,485
The reason that you went to the trouble
of getting to Sasuke before us and...

227
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,154
putting a Curse Mark on him
without killing him...

228
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,032
In other words,

229
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,534
we were the guinea pigs to measure
Sasuke's abilities

230
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,703
during the examinations.

231
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:51,209
What you wanted isn't Sasuke's life,
but Sasuke himself...

232
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,588
I was also taken for a fool...

233
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,386
Now, let the tenth round begin.

234
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,144
Hey, can you hear it?

235
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,939
The clear,

236
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:19,112
blue sky goes on and on

237
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,073
The ocean

238
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:28,162
spans limitlessly

239
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,207
Please keep that smile

240
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,796
on your face forever

241
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:43,136
Or else I'll cry

242
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,223
You won't have to search around you

243
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,185
It's all ok now.

244
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is inside

245
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,028
this hand

246
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:05,199
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

247
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,746
When you forget what happiness is

248
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,750
Just sing.

249
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,921
Light is born, and darkness was born

250
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

251
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,638
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

252
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,603
Hey, can you hear it?

253
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,025
Sakura!

254
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,110
Do you know where
Kakashi Sensei is?
Naruto...

255
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,530
I'm gonna have him watch
my training until the main tournament.

256
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,034
Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.

257
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,079
What's up with you, Sakura?
You seem a little down.

258
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,580
No, nothing...

259
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,750
It's just that I get this bad feeling...

260
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,921
Next episode: "A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke"

261
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,589
I feel uneasy for some reason...
