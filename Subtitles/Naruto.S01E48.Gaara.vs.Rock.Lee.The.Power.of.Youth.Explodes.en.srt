1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,482
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,170
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,922
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,539
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,093
Hey you, failure.

20
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,681
I have two pieces of advice for you.

21
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,434
First, if you intend to call
yourself a Shinobi,

22
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,228
stop that revolting cheering of yours.

23
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,105
And second...

24
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,818
a failure will always be a failure.

25
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,653
There's no changing that!

26
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,741
Do you want to see about that?

27
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,000
You!

28
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,170
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

29
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,966
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!

30
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:17,221
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort...

31
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,807
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,145
I promise you.

33
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,240
I will win no matter what!

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,296
Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!

35
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,257
Hey, Choji!

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,009
You're in trouble.

37
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,595
Only the strong ones are left.

38
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:02,057
Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound
must be that bloke.

39
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,312
And Lee is apparently strong
enough to take on Sasuke!

40
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,148
And particularly that Sand guy!

41
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,776
He's probably the most dangerous one!

42
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,743
I-I don't care!

43
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,454
I plan to forfeit right away
if that happens...

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,997
So that means...
Huh?

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,958
...you plan to forego
all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.

46
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,252
What? Come on!

47
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,088
Don't worry.

48
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,340
If things start getting ugly,

49
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,260
I'll step in and stop the fight,
like I did for Hinata. Okay?

50
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,429
Prime beef tongue, short ribs...

51
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,265
– You can eat what you want.
– Don't dangle food in front of him!

52
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,892
– Besides he didn't step in...
– You can eat whatever you want...

53
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,227
– and stop the fight for Hinata.
– and all you want.

54
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:56,153
B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q! All you can eat!

55
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,742
He doesn't look good.

56
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,204
Watching the previous fight...

57
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,289
Did it get stirred up?

58
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,001
His inner demon!

59
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,506
I'm curious about that guy, Neji, too...

60
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,009
Here's a plan.

61
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,346
Kankuro?

62
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,974
Just a little
information-gathering mission.

63
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,977
Hey!
Huh?

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,729
What are you doing here all by yourself?

65
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,190
Shouldn't you be with your friends?

66
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,026
I-It's none of your business, is it?!

67
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,989
Hmmm. Well, well...

68
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,242
That guy...Neji Hyuga, right?

69
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,369
Well, it seems to me that

70
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,288
he didn't reveal the true extent
of his power in that last match.

71
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,540
What's he about?

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,794
I'm going to crush him!

73
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,298
Err, that's not what I was asking.

74
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,261
Besides, this guy's way out of his league...

75
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,016
You seem like a fun guy. I quite like you.

76
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,478
You're dull. And I don't like you at all!

77
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,442
I'm going to waste this guy!

78
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,905
We will now resume the battle.

79
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,535
Okay!

80
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,914
You'll be up this time for sure.
Go for it, Lee!

81
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,957
No!

82
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,042
– Huh?
– What?

83
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,464
Seeing as I've come this far,
I rather be the last!

84
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,010
Is Lee sulking?

85
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,164
Hurry up and get down here...

86
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,794
Safe!

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,839
– Hey!
– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!

88
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,092
Gaara vs. Rock Lee

89
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,094
Oh! Lee!

90
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,555
It worked!

91
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,225
If you say you want to go last,
then you won't be last.

92
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,103
It's an application of the same law

93
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,606
that says a stone thrown to hit
a telephone pole will miss,

94
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,650
and a stone thrown to miss
will be a direct hit!

95
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,528
Right! That's my student!

96
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,739
I absolutely did not want to go last!

97
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,450
I threw them a beauty of a curve!

98
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,327
Threw whom a curve?

99
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,998
Okay, so let me give you
a little piece of "nice" advice.

100
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,083
Right!

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,962
Probably no one has noticed yet, but...

102
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,216
That gourd is suspicious!

103
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,425
I see!

104
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,010
Quit with the notes!

105
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:11,306
You're not going to have time to
read them during the match! Fool!

106
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,933
I see!

107
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,894
He didn't realize that?

108
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,897
Wow, is Lee going to be all right?

109
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,485
All right! Go! Lee!

110
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,404
Yeah!

111
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,666
I am very happy to be squaring
off with you so early in the match.

112
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:46,466
I don't know what kind of moves
that bowl-cut guy has,

113
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,510
but he will never take Gaara.

114
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,345
Never!

115
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,309
He's fast, to be sure,
but his kick is not all that great.

116
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,519
No...

117
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,575
He's...strong!

118
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,789
Please don't be in such a hurry.

119
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,214
Lee...

120
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,386
Be careful, Lee.

121
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,061
Now then... The 9th match...

122
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,273
Begin!

123
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,695
Leaf Hurricane!

124
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,172
Is that...?

125
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,423
Sand?

126
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,342
What an unusual Jutsu...

127
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,845
There's sand in his gourd!

128
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,806
That's...

129
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,395
That's it?

130
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,523
Desert Coffin!

131
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,951
Desert Burial!

132
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,332
Not another horror story like that...

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,544
A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?

134
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,296
Sounds like trouble.

135
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,756
But let's give it a go!

136
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,287
Even that Lee's fast strikes...

137
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,039
have no effect at all!

138
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,833
What's the deal?!

139
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,503
No physical strike is going to
have any effect on him.

140
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,588
What?

141
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,631
The Sand shields and protects Gaara

142
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,760
on its own accord, independently
of any intent on Gaara's part.

143
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,265
That's why...no one has been able
to do it so far...

144
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,311
Injure Gaara, that is.

145
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,985
Curses! He's not moving
a muscle and still...!

146
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,654
Is that it?

147
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,159
Entertain me a bit more...

148
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,245
There's not enough yet!

149
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,499
Blood!

150
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,350
Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?

151
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,061
He'll never be able to get close
enough for that!

152
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,773
Why doesn't he step back a bit and
use Ninjutsu or something?

153
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,192
It's not that he doesn't use it.

154
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,986
He can't use it.
Huh?

155
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:40,242
Lee has almost no Ninjutsu
or Genjutsu skills.

156
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,451
N-No way!

157
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,998
When I first met Lee,
he was completely inept.

158
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,000
He had no talent whatsoever.

159
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,254
What? I can't believe that!

160
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,116
Hey hey!

161
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,253
Certainly...

162
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,424
A ninja who can't do Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu is a rarity.

163
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,051
That's why

164
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:46,349
the only path open to Lee
as a Ninja was Taijutsu.

165
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,353
But! That's precisely what
makes him a winner!

166
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,688
Huh?

167
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,315
Lee, take them off!

168
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,651
B-But Guy Sensei...!

169
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,446
You told me only to do that

170
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,822
to protect a large group
of very important people!

171
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,866
That's quite all right!

172
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,284
I give you permission!

173
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,253
Are those...?

174
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,505
Weights?

175
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,007
That's some cliché training...

176
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,592
I see!

177
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,718
Ridiculous!

178
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,182
All right, now I can move easily!

179
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,894
Humph! Does he think
removing some measly little weights

180
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,064
is going to enable him to
outmaneuver Gaara's sand...?

181
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,405
A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.

182
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,493
Go, Lee!

183
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,577
Right!

184
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,510
Go!

185
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,720
Very close!

186
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,930
Fast!

187
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,223
Amazing...!

188
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,899
Because he can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu...

189
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:22,070
Therefore, he channeled all of his time,

190
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,447
all of his energy and...

191
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,617
all of his being into Taijutsu.

192
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,580
Though he can't do any other Jutsu...

193
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,583
He won't lose to anyone...

194
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,543
He is a Taijutsu specialist!

195
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,560
I can't believe it! Gaara's been injured!

196
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,604
No way...!

197
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,566
Bushy-Brows is even faster than before!

198
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,111
Was he this strong?!

199
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:08,825
Youth is...explosion!

200
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,285
Right!

201
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,836
Over here!

202
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,759
Good!

203
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,136
I got him good!

204
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,473
A-Amazing, he's so fast!

205
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,267
The Sand Shield can't keep up with him!

206
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,602
A direct hit!

207
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,896
A-Amazing.

208
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,148
His strikes are lightning fast...!

209
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,609
I can't even track him with my eyes!

210
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:54,996
Uh oh...

211
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,956
Uh oh is right!

212
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,169
That black-circles-under-the-eye
guy is taking some serious blows!

213
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,713
That's not what I meant.
Huh?

214
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,774
W-What the...?!

215
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,485
His face is crumbling right off...!

216
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,946
His whole body is covered with sand...

217
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,698
There's not a scratch on him!

218
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,117
W-What's with this guy?!

219
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,582
Sure enough, he was encased in sand, eh.

220
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,460
But, it's been a long time since

221
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,004
I've seen that expression on Gaara's face.

222
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,883
I felt that he was becoming
more and more unstable

223
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,429
as the Chunin Exam progressed...

224
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,892
So Gaara's other self has
been awakened, eh?

225
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,774
Hey! What is that?

226
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,611
That protected him
against Bushy-Brow's strikes?

227
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,657
Yes... It's Sand Armor.
Armor?

228
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,578
Ordinarily, the Sand Shield
functions to protect him automatically,

229
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,414
but, if by chance,
the Shield is penetrated,

230
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,791
the Sand Armor functions as a second
layer of protection against strikes...

231
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,670
That's Gaara's...absolute defense!

232
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,923
Well then, there's no way to get him!

233
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,967
He doesn't have any weak points.

234
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,220
No. That's not entirely true...

235
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,183
The Sand Armor is actually
riddled with weak points.

236
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,228
First of all, because it's not automatic,
it uses up a lot of Chakra.

237
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,064
It's also less effective
than the Sand Shield,

238
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,650
and it takes an enormous amount
of physical energy

239
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,611
to keep the sand clinging
to the body like that.

240
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:56,159
Gaara's having to use the armor...
is proof that he's under pressure.

241
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,747
That Lee is really good...

242
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,083
But, the outcome of the match
is already a given.

243
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,046
He will never beat Gaara!

244
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,507
Is that all?

245
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,260
But what an incredible defense he has...

246
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,264
no amount of speed is going
to let me get a strike through.

247
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,187
I'll have to do major damage
from above the sand guard.

248
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,689
That will be Lotus!

249
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,111
Yes.

250
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,835
Be ready!

251
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,802
A thin sand guard like that
will be inconsequential

252
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,806
in the face of Lee's high-speed
Lotus slamming down from above.

253
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,017
Hurry up and bring it on!

254
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,936
You asked for it!

255
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,942
He didn't float.
Not just yet!

256
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,035
What an amazing series of kicks!

257
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,417
Even an ordinary Lotus has
a tremendous strain on the body...!

258
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,878
Lee, let this be the finishing blow!

259
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,810
Take this!

260
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,563
Primary Lotus!

261
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,508
I got him...

262
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,636
good!

263
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,430
Right on!

264
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,766
I-It's over!

265
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,935
W-What? This can't be!

266
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,854
He did it! Lee's won!

267
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,358
Hey, he isn't dead, is he?

268
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,618
Wha...?!

269
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,831
Huh?!

270
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,803
What?!

271
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,228
Hey, can you hear it?

272
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,981
The clear,

273
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:19,070
blue sky goes on and on

274
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,115
The ocean

275
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:28,663
spans limitlessly

276
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:33,584
Please keep that smile

277
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,713
on your face forever

278
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:43,469
Or else I'll cry

279
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

280
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,269
It's all ok now.

281
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,691
Everyone is inside

282
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,069
this hand

283
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:05,241
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

284
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,746
When you forget what happiness is

285
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

286
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,963
Light is born, and darkness was born

287
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

288
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,097
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

289
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,603
Hey, can you hear it?

290
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,901
Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!

291
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,111
All of your strength seems
to have disappeared!

292
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,615
You're going to be destroyed at this rate!

293
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,243
But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!

294
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,912
How can he continue to keep up
a fighting stance

295
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,539
when he's being routed like this?!

296
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:59,378
Next episode: "Lee's Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!"

297
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,632
The expression in Bushy-Brows' eyes
has changed!
