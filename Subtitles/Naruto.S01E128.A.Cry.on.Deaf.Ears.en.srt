1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:26,110
I just want to convey

3
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,320
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,456
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:44,295
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,136
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,183
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:04,106
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:11,071
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:14,784
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

12
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

13
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

14
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,338
and melting away

15
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:54,949
Sasuke!

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,247
Are you going to
run away from me?!

17
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:25,145
Yo...loser.

18
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:30,568
A Cry on Deaf Ears

19
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,249
It's you this time, huh?

20
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,964
I couldn't do it.

21
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,468
I was not able to stop Sasuke...

22
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,223
I think...
the one who can stop Sasuke...

23
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,934
the one who can save Sasuke is...

24
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,730
Naruto...you are the only one.

25
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,693
Naruto...this is my...
once in a lifetime...

26
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,653
favor to ask...

27
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:20,034
Please... Please bring Sasuke back!

28
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,332
I also told this to Sakura, but...

29
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,669
Don't mind me anymore.

30
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,553
What's with that face?

31
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,398
Iruka Sensei, why on the earth
does an outstanding person like me

32
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,234
have to be on the same team with him?

33
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,781
Sasuke graduated with
the highest grade out of all students...

34
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,116
Naruto, you are at the bottom!

35
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,662
When you even out
the team's strength,

36
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,538
9then it naturally becomes like this.

37
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,542
Try your best not to slow me down,
you dunce.

38
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,797
I am fine without eating!

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,257
I am absolutely fine.

40
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,302
I'm...fine...

41
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,722
Here.

42
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,693
You asked Sakura for a hint the other day,

43
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,487
what did she tell you?

44
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,409
Shall we go?

45
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,827
Yup.

46
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,293
Wh-What's with that face...?

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,549
You loser...

48
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,511
Why...?

49
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,308
You... I hated you, you know.

50
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,732
It's none of your business!

51
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,612
Who knows,

52
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,701
my body moved on its own.

53
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,876
You rescue Sakura, no matter what!

54
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,838
Sasuke... You...

55
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,843
I could still distract him for a little while...

56
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,597
I lost everything once.

57
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,559
I don't want to see my precious comrades

58
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,813
die in front of me anymore.

59
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,942
Why...?

60
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,907
Why is it...Sasuke?

61
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,496
Why did you become like this?!

62
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,333
You!

63
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,802
Whatever happens to me,
what does that have to do with you?

64
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,555
I have my own way.

65
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,058
No matter who it is,

66
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,976
nobody has the right
to tell me what to do.

67
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,772
I will tell you the truth.

68
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,945
I'm done fooling around with
you guys of the Leaf.

69
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,823
Go home.

70
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,214
I'll take care of him!

71
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,757
Choji...

72
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,050
Go everyone!

73
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,391
Go, quickly! I'll catch up with you.

74
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,518
Neji...

75
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,853
Okay!

76
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,356
Hold on!

77
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,947
Kiba...

78
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,533
Kiba! Akamaru!

79
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,870
Now! Naruto!

80
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,622
Shikamaru...

81
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,958
The strategy...a success!

82
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,503
What are you doing?
Please go quickly!

83
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,426
You also promised Sakura
with a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.

84
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,094
Bushy Brow...

85
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,347
I'll defeat this person.

86
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,350
It's a promise.

87
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,937
Everyone...

88
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,862
Everyone risked their lives
to come after you, you know!

89
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,365
Good job for them.

90
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,591
Lastly, I will tell you
the most important thing.

91
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,638
Sasuke is neither a close friend
of mine nor

92
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,556
is he someone I like.

93
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,394
But Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

94
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,146
A comrade.

95
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,315
That's why we will rescue him
by risking our lives.

96
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,275
This is the Leaf way.

97
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:09,716
How do you take your comrades
of the Leaf?!

98
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,665
Comrades, you said...

99
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,463
Did I become stronger staying
with those so-called comrades?

100
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,759
I am going to where Orochimaru is.

101
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,432
Orochimaru is the person who killed
the Third Hokage

102
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,393
and tried to crush The Leaf Village!

103
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,314
Do you think he will
give you the power freely?

104
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,320
He just wants your body
as a vessel!

105
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,073
You might not be able to come back.
You might get killed.

106
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:18,994
You think I'd easily let you
go to such a place?!

107
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,679
That doesn't matter to me...

108
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,894
If my goal is accomplished,
then that's all that matters.

109
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,731
If you intend to get in that way...

110
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,359
Then it can't be helped...

111
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:58,742
You're not gonna be able to!
I'll take you back even by force!

112
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,834
Why are you laughing?!

113
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,380
You were laughing at that time too.

114
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,508
That time...?

115
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,176
What's funny?

116
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,971
It's not funny. I am happy.

117
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,934
Thinking about...
how I can finally defeat you here.

118
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,065
That time you wanted to fight me, right?

119
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,651
You were thrilled weren't you?

120
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,194
At first!

121
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,406
But, you were different.

122
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,200
That was...

123
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,244
Hurry up and come.

124
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,789
But first, put on your Headband.
I'll wait.

125
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,666
I don't need such a thing...

126
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,876
Just put it on!

127
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,842
You won't be able to
put one scratch on my face.

128
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,844
That's not it!

129
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:03,390
I'm saying that this is a sign
that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.

130
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,768
That is what I call a stuck up!

131
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,062
You think you and I are equal?

132
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,022
Yeah, I think so.

133
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,401
I've never thought I was inferior to you.

134
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,611
You're so obnoxious!

135
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,030
Stop!

136
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,377
That was...

137
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,800
That was not the kind of fight I wanted.

138
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,930
Even now...this is not...

139
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,018
I don't care about
your circumstances.

140
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,334
What...is this power?

141
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,714
Power is flowing out...

142
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,819
So this is the power that
the guy was talking about.

143
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,573
Furthermore, the power
is growing into my body.

144
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,496
If it is like that now...

145
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,874
if I release this curse mark...

146
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,880
I wonder how much power...

147
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,977
Wh-What power...

148
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,689
He's not the same as before...

149
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,210
Wake up already!

150
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,361
I awakened long ago...

151
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:32,033
From my idiotic self who dreams about
a lax peaceful future...

152
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,373
hanging out with comrades.

153
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,043
That's why I left the village!

154
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,546
That's why I sought power!

155
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,924
My dream is not in the future.

156
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,387
My dream is in the past...

157
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,433
That's the only place it exists.

158
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,821
Wow, Brother!

159
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,908
You hit the target right in the middle,
even the one behind the rock!

160
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,827
All right, me too!

161
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,789
Sasuke, let's go home.

162
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,795
Geez... You said that
you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

163
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:12,133
There is an important mission tomorrow
and I need to prepare for that.

164
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,929
Liar...

165
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,945
Forgive me, Sasuke...
Another time.

166
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,910
Brother, watch me!

167
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,831
Hey! If you push yourself...

168
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,050
Why is the one who twisted
his ankle laughing?

169
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,637
Could it be that you are trying
to take the easy way?

170
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,848
That's not true...

171
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,808
I'm happy thinking about

172
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,644
how I'm finally going to
the Academy starting tomorrow.

173
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,066
I'm going to do my best
when I enter the Academy.

174
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,321
So even that father will approve of me.

175
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,950
He will count on me
like he does on my brother...

176
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,072
Sasuke... You really are...

177
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,452
I told you...

178
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,957
I don't need a future
with you guys anymore.

179
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,756
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.

180
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,564
For the first time, I spoke to you

181
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,609
And you smiled

182
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,529
For the first time, I was able to speak

183
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,406
In my own words

184
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:27,412
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

185
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:32,792
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

186
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:38,840
My clumsy attempts with words

187
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:44,387
You listened without turning away

188
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

189
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:57,900
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

190
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,695
I feel so sad

191
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,988
But...

192
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,365
For the first time, I spoke to you

193
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,577
And you smiled

194
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,038
For the first time, I was able to speak

195
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,166
In my own words

196
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,752
For the first time, I spoke to you

197
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,963
And you smiled

198
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,050
For the first time, I was able to speak

199
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,926
In my own words

200
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:29,098
For the first time, I spoke to you

201
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,276
I feel power surging
through my body...

202
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,528
It's as though I can't lose.

203
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:48,326
It's power I'd never have gained
playing comrade with you guys from Leaf.

204
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:53,081
But it's not enough.
It's way short of enough, Naruto!

205
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:58,336
Strength...hatred...and desire!

206
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,881
