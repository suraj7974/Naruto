1
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:45,921
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up

7
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:55,097
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light

8
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:05,649
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows

9
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:15,284
There was something beyond that...
What were you gazing at?

10
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,456
What were you gazing at?

11
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,949
– Where...
– Where...

12
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,743
– Where...am I?
– Where...am I?

13
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:51,547
Remembrance: The Lost Page

14
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,680
All right! I'm up for it today again,
believe it!

15
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,104
However... There haven't been
any flashy missions around here lately.

16
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,612
C'mon! It's unbelievable, right?!

17
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,696
Yeah well...

18
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,158
Lately, I'm dead tired from doing
nothing but training.

19
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,701
Sakura!

20
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,869
Naruto!

21
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,245
There's someone who got
too much time on his hands!

22
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,372
What's that?! Speak for yourself.

23
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,666
No matter how I look at it,
you are just helping the shop.

24
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,501
What happened to Shikamaru
and Choji?

25
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,754
On a mission with Asuma Sensei!

26
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,299
Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!

27
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:40,638
While Ino was down with a cold,
everyone went on urgent missions.

28
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,766
And now I'm completely recovered!

29
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,185
What am I going to do with
all my fighting spirit?

30
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,687
Why don't you use that fighting spirit
in some training?

31
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,147
That's what you think!

32
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,441
In my family, if you don't have
a training partner,

33
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,320
then they make up some reason
for you to help out with the shop!

34
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,740
They must know that if you're alone
you'll skip training, eh?

35
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,202
H-Hey! Don't say something that
could hurt a person's reputation!

36
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,496
I do it properly by myself.

37
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,123
Naruto...

38
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,293
Stop it, Shino! Don't surprise me!

39
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,254
Naruto Uzumaki... Yamanaka Ino...

40
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,007
The Hokage is asking
for both of you.

41
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,968
What? Me too?

42
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,430
By the way, I've also been ordered to go,
along with you guys.

43
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,183
Ino... me and Shino?

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,476
Huh?

45
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,356
Demon of Ocean causing disturbance...?

46
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,359
Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.

47
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,072
It seems to be the cause of the disturbance
happening in the remote Land of Sea...

48
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,284
What's wrong...?

49
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,705
You'll go for me, won't you?

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,208
Of course.

51
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,754
Shizune...
Y-Yes!

52
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,256
Explain...

53
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,799
Y-Yes!

54
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,219
As you can see,

55
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,847
the Land of Sea is made up of
a group of islands of various sizes.

56
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,308
Recently in that area, their only means
of transportation, ships,

57
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,603
are being attacked and robbed
of money and valuables.

58
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,024
The people on the boat who
were victimized

59
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,985
unanimously claim that the damage
was done by the "Demon of the Ocean."

60
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,115
And exterminating this Demon
of the Ocean is the mission?

61
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,994
Well... more or less, yes.
But there's more.

62
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,830
The Land of Sea does not have
a hidden village of its own,

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,206
so they're prepared for contingencies

64
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,126
through military cooperation with
the neighboring country, the Land of Water,

65
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,378
and have been paying them
a retainer every month...

66
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,423
However, the other day,
one of their ships that collects funds

67
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,383
was attacked by
the Demon of the Ocean as well...

68
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,055
I see. To preserve their relationship
with Land of Water,

69
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,349
Land of Sea will do anything
to protect the next ship.

70
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,729
Yes... This mission is to guard
the ships collecting funds

71
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,105
and destroy the Demon of the Ocean...

72
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,859
I've got a few people to work under you,
so I'm counting on you.

73
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,360
Work under me...?

74
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:02,863
Enter!

75
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,704
The Chunin Exam's...

76
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,416
Th-That scary proctor!

77
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,670
Oh, you're bringing back memories..!

78
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,091
A-Anko Mitarashi Sensei?

79
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,425
Why are you here?

80
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,676
– Everyone!
– Yes!

81
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,762
I'm pronouncing your mission!

82
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,057
Shino Aburame!
Ino Yamanaka! Naruto Uzumaki!

83
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,646
The three of you will work under Anko
and accompany her on a mission!

84
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,481
What?! These members?

85
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,900
The team is pretty disjointed, isn't it?!

86
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,318
No use talking about it!

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,612
Listen... I've thought through
the matter and

88
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,449
I believe that this combination is

89
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,535
the most qualified for this mission...

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,248
All of you display your own capabilities
to the full extent and execute this mission!

91
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,791
– Yes!
– Yes!

92
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,921
She just gathered the available Genin...
Really, she is such a...

93
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,176
Still, something doesn't feel quite right...

94
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,638
Yeah, yeah, no complaints about
a mission that's settled!

95
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,974
Ouuch... I got it!

96
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,893
Okay, we'll depart right away!

97
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,646
Everyone prepare and assemble
at the front gate!

98
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,730
– Roger!
– Roger!

99
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,732
Oh, ouch!

100
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,861
Anko...

101
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,784
Be careful...

102
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,831
Yes...

103
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,216
Characteristics of
the Demon of the Ocean...

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,928
It's like a fish, like a person...
What is this?!

105
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:54,016
Huh, someone's eyes are playing tricks.
Something like that can't exist!

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,561
Not true, it's possible that Ex-Ninja
become pirates

107
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,480
and use Transformation and Genjutsu.

108
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,277
Well, whatever, if we don't gather
information, there will be no solution.

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,403
Right...

110
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,781
Mother Island is the biggest island
at the center of Land of Sea...

111
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,409
We'll go to a nearby fishing port
and cross over by boat!

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,452
– I understand!
– I understand!

113
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,456
Yeah! Let's depart for the Land of Sea!

114
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,376
This guy is always hyper...

115
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,921
I'm anxious about what's going to happen.

116
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,926
Here you are...

117
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,847
Um... Lady Tsunade...

118
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,312
It's about...Anko Mitarashi just now...

119
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,274
Did, uh...
Did something happen in the past?

120
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,656
Sort of...

121
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,208
Oh? This is...

122
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,753
Her record of missions from about
the age of ten is pretty sporadic.

123
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:09,049
Because Anko was under Orochimaru...

124
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,761
So the parts that are blacked out

125
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,596
are combined
with Orochimaru's movements...

126
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,431
and in the confidential file?

127
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,559
Part of them are...
Huh?

128
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,271
There are some parts
that aren't recorded...

129
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,563
That's the truth.

130
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,776
No record?! Even though
Anko herself was in the village?

131
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,906
That Orochimaru...

132
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,201
It seems he really didn't
want to be traced...

133
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,870
When he left the village...

134
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,540
He erased part of Anko's memories.

135
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,670
The wind is salty...

136
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,840
Coming this far, we can already
see over the Land of Sea.

137
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,092
Then, that must be the Mother Island?

138
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,131
What? What is this feeling?

139
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,557
Everyone... Sorry but...

140
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,559
Go ahead and take care
of the arrangements for the boat.

141
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,394
What? But, what would you do, Sensei?

142
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:49,066
I'll take care of some business
and join you... See you!

143
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh! Sensei?!

144
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,028
C'mon, it can't be helped...

145
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,905
What are you doing, Shino?

146
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,782
We'll leave you behind!

147
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,949
Yeah...

148
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,541
The Curse Mark aches.

149
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,211
This presence... No question about it.

150
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,671
This way?

151
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,612
I can say their names
without a problem!

152
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,784
Um... That's Mother Island...

153
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,994
These are Taro Island and Jiro island.

154
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,457
And... That there's Demon Island!

155
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,709
Seems you prepared before you came...

156
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:56,716
I want to become a wiser, stronger
Shinobi like you, Master Orochimaru...

157
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,427
Oh...?

158
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,605
Here.

159
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,280
Sorry, but I can't give you anything
more than this.

160
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,782
What's up...Ino?

161
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,950
Hey, mister!

162
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,828
Aren't you bringing prices down
way too much?

163
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,788
That's high-quality fish, isn't it?

164
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,914
Oh dear...

165
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,167
I'm not price-cutting...

166
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,920
See... Because of that
"Demon of the Ocean" uproar,

167
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,840
customers are completely staying away...

168
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,634
This is the market price around here.

169
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,805
Really? That fish is rarely...
Oh!

170
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,143
What's with her appearance?
Is she injured or something?

171
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,771
No... That girl, she has her reasons.

172
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,485
Well...
She's a female diver from a small town
on the cape of Mother Island...

173
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,569
What?!

174
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,948
Why would a woman diver on
Mother Island transfer islands on purpose?

175
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,411
That's because, the island people
didn't want to do business with her...

176
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,372
That girl...

177
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,625
In the past, she was spirited away...

178
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,918
Spirited away...?

179
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,213
A person suddenly disappears...
is that it?

180
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,466
That's right! In the past,

181
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,927
a lot of island people disappeared
from being spirited away.

182
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,012
The story is that out of all those people

183
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,223
that girl was the only one
who suddenly returned one day.

184
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,141
Hey, hey!

185
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,435
It's a little village...

186
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,604
So everyone felt creepy.

187
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,279
They say that now, she lives alone
outside of the village...

188
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,450
I see... I feel sorry for her.

189
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,663
With her appearance...
And then you hear things, I too...

190
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,165
feel a little bit creepy...

191
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,834
That's true.

192
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,089
Hey, where's Naruto?
I don't know...

193
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,537
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

194
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,496
Oh no!

195
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,208
Hey, are you okay?
Yes...

196
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,381
You're uh... You're from a place called
Mother Island, aren't you?

197
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,010
Uh... Nothing...

198
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,972
Ninja...

199
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,266
Oh, I'll help!

200
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,893
That's okay...
Huh...? H-Hey... Wait.

201
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,022
What the...?

202
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:05,405
It's too bad but, the last boat from
the port has already left.

203
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,116
But the sun hasn't even set yet...

204
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,746
Around here, there's nobody who
will take you across in the early evening...

205
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,332
Sorry, but come back tomorrow.

206
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,958
No way...

207
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,003
Well, is there a way to get to
Mother Island besides the ferry?

208
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,923
Mmm, I can't really advise it, but...

209
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,260
If it's necessary,
I'll let you borrow my little boat.

210
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,185
Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!

211
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,937
C'mon! Where were you?!

212
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,398
Sorry, sorry...

213
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,984
You should at least say something
before you disappear.

214
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:48,156
You and Sensei are exactly alike,
suddenly going someplace.

215
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,535
Feels like there'll be
a bumpy road ahead.

216
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,454
What?! That's rude.

217
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,208
Placing me in the same category together
with that unreasonable sensei...!

218
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,377
Who's what?
S-Sorry.

219
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,962
This sensei... is dangerous, after all...

220
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,757
Good work procuring the boat!

221
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,052
S-Sensei... Where in the world
have you been all this time?

222
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,388
Oh, something like
gathering information...

223
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,848
Well, let's go!

224
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,811
The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here...

225
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,105
Land of Sea must have
pleaded with them

226
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,816
to investigate on
the "Demon of the Ocean."

227
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,819
Well then, we should give them
the best welcome.

228
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,281
It's getting dark...

229
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,244
We're almost to Mother Island.

230
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,206
All right, all right!
Full speed advance to Mother Island!

231
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,999
Although the sun has already set ...

232
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,669
Where does all your hyper-energy
come from?!

233
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,381
Times like this,
your state of mind is important!

234
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,261
Sakura sure has her share of trouble...
I feel sorry for her.

235
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,685
What the...!
I ran up against a rock or something!

236
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,228
Hang in there, Naruto!

237
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,564
Hey, all of you look forward, front!

238
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,858
Dodge it, quick!

239
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,152
You say that, but...

240
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,820
It's no good, the oar won't move!

241
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,280
I'll help!

242
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,033
You...!
Striking Shadow Snake!

243
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,875
Naruto! Leave it!

244
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,376
I understand!

245
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,839
To show themself so soon...

246
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,221
That was close...

247
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,100
The two of you be careful!
He's aiming at us from underwater!

248
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,019
Dammit!

249
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,771
Demon of the Ocean or whatever,

250
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,398
an underwater creature for
an underwater battle!

251
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,566
Summoning Jutsu!

252
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,319
I'm counting on you... Chief Toad!

253
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,906
What?!

254
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey! Naruto!
What kind of place did you call me to?!

255
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,539
Why did you come out!
You stupid frog!
Oh! Hey, wait!

256
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,041
Summoning Jutsu.

257
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,085
Please come out, Chief Toad!

258
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,671
Hey, good evening!

259
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,549
It can't be!
I have been calling for Chief Toad!

260
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,677
Stupid! If you summoned
the old man to a place like this,

261
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,221
terrible things would happen.

262
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,347
Huh? Why?

263
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,351
We're freshwater creatures!
We don't go with saltwater!

264
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,770
I don't like salty things either.

265
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,273
You're no help at all!

266
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,153
Shino! Take care of Ino...
Okay!

267
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,076
All right!
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!

268
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,922
Water Clone?!

269
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,591
You let your guard down!

270
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,302
You did too!
Take that!

271
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,353
There was one more?!

272
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,982
What the...? My body strength is...!

273
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,486
How is it?
My improved skill of Chakra Suction?

274
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,865
What's happening?!

275
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,662
Where did he go? Damn it!

276
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,374
My visibility is too bad...

277
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,839
Hey, pull yourself together, Naruto!

278
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,136
Big Brother, it itches.

279
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,471
Ah, I'm at my limit, too...

280
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,975
B-Big Brother!

281
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,688
This is not so good.

282
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,108
Naruto!
What happened?

283
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,448
You two are?!

284
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,869
I'll discharge all the Chakra
I absorbed at once...

285
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,830
Water Style: Furious Current Jutsu!

286
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:15,256
Shoot! I can't approach them
so easily with this.

287
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,799
Naruto...

288
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,681
I can't stand this!

289
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,572
The wind blows, Ah...

290
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,368
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

291
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,829
What should be brought along?

292
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,832
Assemble them into a piece.

293
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,877
There is no second chance, never

294
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,588
How foolish it is to throw away

295
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,842
Acting so innocently, Ah...

296
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,427
The images.

297
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,851
It probably will not end

298
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:56,107
It probably will not end

299
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,778
Burn that love-filled heart,

300
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,032
Sail across a thousand dreams

301
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,909
Running freely

302
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,747
To take hold of the world in hand

303
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,750
The clouds scatter

304
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,836
The sun sets yet again

305
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,426
The solo parade begins to move.

306
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,637
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

307
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:30,058
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

308
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,150
To think the departure of
the collection ship

309
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,443
would be moved up
at the time like this.

310
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,569
It can't be helped.

311
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,821
We've got to find Naruto somehow
by tomorrow morning.

312
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,115
I hope we pick up some information about
the Demon of the Ocean along the way.

313
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,701
The search range is quite expansive, huh?

314
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,786
It'd be best to split up.

315
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,955
Then I'll go from the south,
you guys take the north.

316
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,123
– Roger!
– Roger!

317
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,666
Think about what happened yesterday.

318
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,252
Each of you, tackle this with care. Scatter!

319
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,714
Next time: "The Closed Door"
