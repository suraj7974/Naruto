1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,683
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,738
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,420
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,318
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,420
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,429
Ton Ton, I'm Counting on You!

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,604
Kurenai Sensei! Asuma Sensei!

22
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,106
W-What happened?!

23
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,403
N-Naruto...

24
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,914
There they are!

25
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,082
Hurry!

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,960
The Medical Corps...?

27
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,841
There's no time to lose!

28
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,634
As soon as they have received
emergency treatment...

29
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,094
transport them immediately!

30
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,182
What in the world...happened?

31
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,021
Don't concern yourself
with the other prisoners!

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,192
We need to focus solely
on Mizuki! Got it?!

33
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,318
– Roger!
– Roger!

34
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,659
Ton Ton, we're close, right?!

35
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,124
There they are!

36
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,209
– Thank you for the meal!
– Thank you for the meal!

37
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,669
It can't be...!

38
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,507
Fuujin...Raijin!

39
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,343
These two are Fuujin and Raijin?

40
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,053
They'll do us in if we lower our guard!

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,974
Elder Brother...which do you prefer,
pork cutlet or ginger pork?

42
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,602
I want both.

43
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,314
Hey you... Where is Mizuki?!

44
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,609
Seems like I'm popular...

45
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,112
When did he sneak in? This isn't good!

46
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:35,132
Damn... Just when I thought things
had quieted down, this happens.

47
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,259
That guy is a tough one to handle.

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,470
Orochimaru...

49
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,187
I wish to report that
we have managed to take

50
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,438
both Kurenai and Asuma
under our protection...

51
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,399
I see... Good work.

52
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,402
Hidden Leaf Hospital

53
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,241
Looks like I underestimated them a little.
My apologies.

54
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,995
No...This is really embarrassing.
I let my guard down.

55
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,832
I didn't think that all the inmates
would break out of prison.

56
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,461
And moreover, the guards
were taken as hostages.

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,298
What happened afterwards?

58
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,637
I believe that this last prison
break incident

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,765
was not an unexpected occurrence...

60
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,978
While that large number of inmates
was escaping from prison,

61
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,230
he utilized that unguarded moment
to slip away.

62
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,066
That jerk Mizuki...!

63
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,319
– Hey!
– Old Lady Tsunade!

64
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,404
S-Stop!

65
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,991
You were talking about Orochimaru,
weren't you?!

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,576
That's why you sent
the Sensei there, right?

67
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,329
I don't know, however...

68
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,374
the handwriting resembles the document
confiscated from the facility

69
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:55,087
where Orochimaru
was conducting human experiments...

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,632
Orochimaru...

71
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,010
This brat...was listening!

72
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,018
Damn, forget it.

73
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,894
Let him go!
Yes ma'am!

74
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,277
In any case,
I've got to find some kind of lead.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,154
Where do you intend to go by yourself?

76
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,118
That goes without saying.
I'm going to bring Sasuke back!

77
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,288
Gimme a break...

78
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,540
At a time when
we don't have adequate troops...

79
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:36,045
and at a time when everybody else
is going all out to do their job, you...

80
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,301
All right.

81
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:47,056
I believe it's certain that Orochimaru
has been involved in this recent incident.

82
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,558
However...

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,812
The situation with Orochimaru
and Sasuke has already gone

84
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,898
beyond the point of being dealt with
on an individual level.

85
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,860
This isn't the kind of thing that you,
a Genin, could handle alone.

86
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,362
If you understand me,

87
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,323
go and do the mission
you are already assigned to!

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,918
What! Shizune is...?!

89
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,131
Ton Ton! Something has happened
to Shizune, hasn't it?!

90
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,637
I don't have any idea what you're saying,

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,847
but Shizune is in trouble, right?!

92
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,850
Got it!

93
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,685
I know what my job right now is!

94
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm gonna rescue Shizune

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,358
and make my way to wherever
Orochimaru is, no matter what!

96
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,779
And then I'm gonna slam
Orochimaru and bring Sasuke back!

97
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,826
You are...!
Show me the way, Ton Ton!

98
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,911
Naruto!

99
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,330
Damn! I need to take urgent measures...

100
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,998
What's the matter?

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,376
Kakashi!

102
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,963
Well, I picked these guys up
on my way back from my mission.

103
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,966
The village is in quite a restless state.

104
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,676
Yes.

105
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,680
And...has Naruto done something yet again?

106
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,643
Even though it's only a tiny clue,

107
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,104
now there's finally something
that links to Orochimaru!

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,024
Wait for me, Shizune!

109
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,901
I'm coming to your rescue!

110
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,032
Naruto... Where is he going in such a hurry?

111
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,790
Fuujin, Raijin...
It's about time to head out!

112
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,375
– All right.
– All right!

113
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,049
M-Mizuki...

114
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,974
I'm gonna find him without fail!

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,851
Sasuke!

116
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,075
Long time no see...Tsubaki.

117
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,038
That woman captain was
pretty tenacious, wasn't she?

118
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,208
Thanks to her, I'm starving,
Elder Brother.

119
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,669
I can't stop laughing!
Oh, it stopped.

120
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,637
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

121
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,598
Haven't seen this vista for quite a while.

122
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,558
Y-Yes...

123
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,230
Elder Brother, this rice is hard!

124
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,565
Idiot! It's one and the same once
it's inside your stomach!

125
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,068
I see...you're awesome, Elder Brother.

126
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,528
What's this? It's gotten all raggedy.

127
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,907
You need to buy a new one.
Yes.

128
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,993
What's the matter, Tsubaki?

129
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,747
I noticed some Black Ops
in the mountains earlier.

130
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,958
In a secluded place
in the mountains like this!

131
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,382
I see.

132
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,514
You won't tell me anything, will you?

133
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:22,479
To you, the Leaf Village looks just
like it did before, doesn't it, Mizuki?

134
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,316
However...

135
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,405
A lot of people died while
you were away, Mizuki.

136
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,825
This rice soup is great,
huh, Elder Brother?

137
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,411
Yeah... Very different from the institution.

138
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,372
Are you leaving again?

139
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,293
Yeah...
Stop!

140
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:49,298
Please, Mizuki! Please end
your involvement with Orochimaru!

141
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,430
Because of Orochimaru, many people died!

142
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,227
Because of Orochimaru,
the Leaf Village was in shambles!

143
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,104
Even the Third Hokage was...

144
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,693
Only if you hadn't gotten involved
with Orochimaru, Mizuki,

145
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,154
you and I would now...

146
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,578
Everything will be fine, Tsubaki.

147
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,164
This time, I won't make the mistake

148
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,458
of having that Nine-Tailed brat
get in my way.

149
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,917
And then...

150
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:30,672
That boy fought for the Leaf
when Orochimaru attacked!

151
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,634
That Nine-Tailed brat did...?

152
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,096
That brat did...?!

153
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,146
That's right. He's not some scary kid
like you said he was!

154
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,774
So please stop with your foolish ideas!

155
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:54,029
It's already over!
It's all already over! So...

156
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,162
No... It's not over yet!

157
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,625
So that Nine-Tailed brat is
acting the hero, huh?

158
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,126
Don't make me laugh!

159
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,005
Half-wits as always, huh! Those Leaf guys!

160
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,009
Mizuki...?!
Come!

161
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,555
I will get my hands on
Orochimaru's ultimate power!

162
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,975
And will teach this village a lesson!

163
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,480
Power... Orochimaru's ultimate power!

164
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:35,612
If I do that...
You and I will have everything go our way!

165
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,159
Mizuki...

166
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,329
Mizuki!

167
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,331
Please...

168
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,501
Become the kind and gentle Mizuki
again just like before.

169
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,463
If you really love me...

170
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,007
don't do anything stupid!

171
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,511
Tsubaki...

172
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,481
All right then...

173
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,483
Well then,
I'll leave the rest in your hands.

174
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,694
Not so quickly!

175
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,947
Here you are! Next for you
is an S-rank mission!

176
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,451
She's a real slave driver.

177
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,163
The Iruka Team...

178
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,290
has completed rounding up the inmates.

179
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,293
Huh?! Kakashi Sensei! I beg your pardon!

180
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,378
Don't worry about it. Good work.

181
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,133
It looks like neither of us are going
to get a chance to rest, Iruka Sensei.

182
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,929
The Art of Summoning!

183
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,310
Hey, youngster...

184
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,771
Well, Iruka Sensei,
I'll leave the rest to you.

185
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,732
Huh? Huh?

186
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,694
Iruka, you have a mission.
Time is of the essence.

187
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,155
Y-Yes, ma'am?

188
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's hurry.
We've taken more time than anticipated.

189
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,169
Mizuki...

190
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,299
How about it, Ton Ton?

191
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,303
Here he comes!

192
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,767
W-Wait, Naruto!
Iruka Sensei?!

193
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,393
Ton Ton?!

194
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,273
So this is what I smelled...

195
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,277
Thanks for your hard work, Ton Ton.

196
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,947
I'll look out for these two
from here onward,

197
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,657
so you go back to the village.

198
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,207
Brother Mizuki... Shouldn't we be hurrying?

199
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,709
T-To Orochimaru's?

200
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,049
That Nine-Tailed brat...

201
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,888
Don't you dare touch, Iruka Sensei!

202
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,557
Otherwise, I'll kill you!

203
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,564
– In that case, I'll go for it!
– In that case, I'll go for it!

204
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,242
I may have done a little too much!

205
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,203
Don't tell me that...

206
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,165
that failure of a Nine-Tailed brat is...

207
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,168
Elder Brother... Do Nine-Tails taste good?

208
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,130
Yeah...I'm sure they're good.

209
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,343
Iruka Sensei, you didn't come here
just to drag me home?

210
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,679
Well, you're not the kind of guy
who would go back calmly

211
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,681
if I simply said "Come back," are you!

212
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,977
You are right, Iruka Sensei!
You really know me, don't you!

213
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,396
Don't get carried away like that!

214
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,315
If you let your guard down
you'll get your fingers burned!

215
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,569
Huh? Did you find something?

216
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,740
Yeah... It's a bad inmate's smell!

217
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,749
Now then, what in the world
can I do with these now?

218
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,421
It smells like
we're getting pretty close now.

219
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,845
Shizune?!

220
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,306
A-Are you all right?

221
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,308
N-Naruto?!

222
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,520
Prisoner's garb is scattered
about here and there.

223
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,316
It looks like somebody's trying
to buy time by deceiving my nose...

224
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,234
Mizuki was just one step away

225
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,153
and we ended up letting them get away.

226
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,989
But I'm so glad you're safe.
Yeah...

227
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,618
My comrades are pursing Mizuki.
Let's hurry!

228
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,702
Okay.

229
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,454
This smells!

230
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,916
There's a strong smell
of prisoners wafting.

231
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,627
It's Mizuki and the others!
There's no mistake!

232
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,588
All right! We're almost there!

233
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,299
But...if we enter the basin just like this

234
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,426
it will make it easy for
the enemy to attack from the plateau.

235
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,220
It would be safer to make a detour

236
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,180
and make our way up to the top of a hill.

237
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,890
What are you talking about?!

238
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,352
We have a really good open view,
so we'll be fine!

239
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,397
Hmm...Those guys are trying to buy time.

240
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,525
If we make a detour, we may not
be able to catch up with them!

241
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,824
Damn!

242
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,784
How could I have fallen for such a trap?!

243
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,120
Be careful, Naruto!

244
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,373
This time, it's not a dummy.
A real entity is lurking there!

245
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,208
A rock?!

246
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,634
– Yippee!
– Thank you for the meal!

247
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,225
Naruto! Behind you!
Shizune!

248
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,605
W-Why is Shizune...?

249
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,150
Move away, Naruto! That's a fake!

250
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,446
What a delight to see you
after such a long time...

251
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,822
Iruka... Naruto!

252
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,992
Iruka Sensei, who's that guy?!

253
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,077
It's Mizuki, Naruto.

254
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,832
Mizuki?! But he seems very
different from before!

255
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,959
That's right, I remember that failure who
in his Academy days

256
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,337
couldn't even master
a decent Transformation Jutsu!

257
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,798
Damn! He's pissing me off!

258
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,135
How's that, Iruka?
You hardly recognize me, do you?

259
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,680
It's true that
there's no comparison with before...

260
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,559
Thanks to being confined in
that sordid and boring prison cell

261
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,811
I was able to concentrate
on my ascetic training.

262
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,813
I thank you, Iruka...

263
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,648
When did you realize it was me?

264
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,486
When we rescued you while
you pretended to be Shizune,

265
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,780
you said,
"My colleagues are pursuing Mizuki."

266
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,074
The only time a subordinate leaves the
team leader behind to pursue the enemy

267
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,494
would be when the team leader had
either died or was near death...

268
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,455
But you had incurred only slight injuries.

269
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,458
A textbook answer.

270
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,293
And also, you didn't say anything

271
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,505
when I suggested making
a detour from our route.

272
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,174
If your subordinates were in pursuit,

273
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,010
it would be a safer strategy to watch
the enemy's movements from a plateau!

274
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,724
Sharp as you are, you used
the prisoner's garb as a decoy

275
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:24,354
not to gain time,
but to lead us into this trap!

276
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,525
Wow...Your power of analysis
is as good as always.

277
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,693
Makes me remember the old days!

278
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,321
Mizuki... Stop with the stupid act!

279
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,076
You have no idea of
the hardships I've endured!

280
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,120
Fuujin! Raijin! Do it!

281
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,580
– Yippee!
– Yippee!

282
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,290
– Come on!
– Stop it, Naruto!

283
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,669
Your opponent is me!

284
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,129
Get away, Naruto!

285
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,258
I'll be fine, Iruka Sensei!

286
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,761
Naruto?!

287
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,930
So you have the leeway
to look away, do you?!

288
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,598
Flee...Naruto!

289
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,480
Damn!

290
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,232
I'm not gonna lose!

291
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,485
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

292
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,283
What?!

293
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,412
It's the same face here and over too.

294
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,833
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

295
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,044
Elder Brother, I don't have
enough fingers to count them all!

296
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,797
You idiot, Raijin. Use my hands too!

297
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,966
Wow! You're so smart, Fuujin...

298
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,970
Wh-What the hell are those guys about?!

299
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,889
Don't get in the way!

300
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,141
I have business with Mizuki!

301
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,020
Elder Brother, he said we were in the way.

302
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,648
But take a look! Elder Brother!
Mizuki looks busy.

303
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,237
That's true. He looks busy.

304
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,531
And also, if we go back just like this

305
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,034
we won't be able to eat a sumptuous meal!

306
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,078
That's right.
I forgot about the sumptuous meal!

307
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,081
– Sumptuous meal!
– Sumptuous meal!

308
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,918
I feel a little thrown off balance.

309
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,796
Let's regroup, everybody!

310
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,590
Go!

311
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,314
I'm itchy, Elder Brother...

312
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,732
Yeah, itchy...

313
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,788
My punches aren't having
any effect whatsoever...

314
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,737
Crappy news pass us by

315
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,157
And you become speechless

316
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,538
My voice is way too soft

317
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,165
So you don't answer

318
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

319
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

320
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

321
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

322
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,313
Yeah

323
00:21:54,397 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

324
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,656
Yeah

325
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

326
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,249
Yeah

327
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

328
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:25,178
Yeah

329
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,734
Damn! What are these two?!

330
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,027
They're not just big!

331
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,698
They can't be beat with
just technique and Jutsu!

332
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,744
Just when I need to get Mizuki!

333
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,664
In any case,
I can't waste time onwith them!

334
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,627
I have to circumvent them somehow
and beat 'em to the punch!

335
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,339
