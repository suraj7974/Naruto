1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,811
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,324
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,711
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,861
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,838
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,527
I never thought he'd attempt
to use the Fourth Hokage's Jutsu.

21
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,404
But it's still just this level...

22
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,032
It's completely different
from the original one.

23
00:01:55,908 --> 00:02:00,120
That Tsunade...Incredibly strong as always.

24
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,290
I remember a long time ago,

25
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,836
getting punched by her and
knocked back nearly 100 meters...

26
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,132
At any rate, Naruto's hopeless.

27
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,218
Are you okay?

28
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,929
Jiraiya, was it you...

29
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,056
who taught him that Rasengan,
the Spiral Chakura Sphere?

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,100
Rasengan...?!

31
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:26,105
I'm his teacher, after all.

32
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,734
Humph...You and the Fourth Hokage are
the only ones who can use that Jutsu.

33
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,154
Are you in your right mind...

34
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,823
showing someone Jutsu
that he can't master?

35
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,993
Don't give him false hope.

36
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:44,540
That's why the moony kid starts joking
about becoming a Hokage!

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,586
It's no joke! Stupid! Stupid!

38
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,755
If I have three days,
I'll master this Jutsu!

39
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,175
You said it, kid.

40
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,428
Men don't go back on their word!

41
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,223
Hah! I stand by my words.

42
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,643
That's my Ninja Way.

43
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,943
Then...how about a wager?

44
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:14,904
A wager...?

45
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,864
I'll give you one week.

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,242
If you can master that Jutsu,

47
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,620
I'll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage

48
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,663
and give you this necklace.

49
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,083
Lady Tsunade! That's the precious...!

50
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,086
I don't need such a sorry necklace!

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,630
Don't say such things, Naruto...

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,716
That's the only one of its kind in this world.

53
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,843
And you could buy three mountains
if you were to sell it.

54
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,889
It belonged to the First Hokage.

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,391
A-Awesome...

56
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,269
Well, that'll be fine!

57
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,272
He'll do anything for money...?

58
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,899
Good...

59
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,570
However, you lose if you can't master
the Jutsu in one week!

60
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,031
And you'll give me all the money
you have on you.

61
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,783
Oh! Gama-chan!

62
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,201
When did she...?!

63
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,536
Lady Tsunade! Why?

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,955
That necklace is...

65
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,415
He won't be able to do it, anyway...

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,125
Let's go, Shizune.

67
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:14,588
She never once used
that necklace for a bet...

68
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,718
You don't have to answer right now.

69
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,972
However, I want it in a week.

70
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,066
Inheritance! The Necklace of Death!

71
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,906
Huh? Who is it this late at night?

72
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,326
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,249
I'm sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.
I need to talk to you...

74
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,962
As for me, I'm going to get
a good night's rest and train tomorrow!

75
00:04:55,254 --> 00:05:00,175
I'm sorry. But I didn't want you
to misunderstand Lady Tsunade...

76
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,679
As well as the necklace...

77
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,224
Humph! I could care less
about an old lady like that!

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,643
Lady Tsunade is not the type
of person you think she is!

79
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,855
Don't speak of her like that
when you don't even know her!

80
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,570
I-I'm sorry...for raising my voice.

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,033
She didn't used to be like that.

82
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,494
She was a kind person
who loved the village.

83
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,915
But, she changed...

84
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,963
After that day...

85
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,424
That day?

86
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,387
What's that day?

87
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:51,727
The day she lost her dreams,
her love, her hopes... Everything.

88
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:59,318
All that was left was
that necklace of memories...

89
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,615
It's as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.

90
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:09,161
It's really not something
to be offered in a bet.

91
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,665
I don't care about that!
She bet it on her own, right?!

92
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,127
Besides...that necklace is really
not something for you to wear.

93
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,797
It's not just a necklace!

94
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,051
It doesn't acknowledge anyone
other than Lady Tsunade.

95
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:30,516
If someone else wears it,
that person inevitably...

96
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,518
... dies!

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,836
Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!

98
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,425
I'm not a kid anymore,
so I don't need gifts on my birthday!

99
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,762
What're you saying?
You're still a kid, aren't you?!

100
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,765
But never mind that.
Hurry up and open your present!

101
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,017
You'll definitely be pleased!

102
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,777
Big Sister, could this be...?

103
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:28,907
Yes... It's the First Hokage's,
our grandfather's necklace!

104
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,701
I love you, Big Sister!

105
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,620
I thought it'd be better than me having it.

106
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,418
You've been wanting it all along, right?
Take good care of it.

107
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,129
Not just this necklace!

108
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,178
This village is grandfather's treasure!
I'm going to protect it!

109
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,096
Nawaki...

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,517
I'm the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so...!

111
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,897
You said it.
Men don't go back on their word!

112
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,981
Right!

113
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:05,110
Someday, I'll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!

114
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,282
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

115
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,787
Take off your headband, Nawaki.

116
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,334
Just hurry up and take it off.
I have another present for you.

117
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,005
It's a charm to make
your dream come true.

118
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,493
It's best if you don't look
at the remains.

119
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,412
There's nothing wrong with that,
is there?

120
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,373
Even if she were to look,

121
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,668
she wouldn't be able to determine
that it's her little brother.

122
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,211
Enough, Orochimaru!

123
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:10,259
We are at war, now.
All Shinobi end up like this.

124
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,929
There are no doctors on
the battlefield, so...

125
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,642
However, children really get
much too excited, don't they?

126
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,187
Especially on the day after
they receive a present.

127
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,617
Not just this necklace...

128
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:44,209
This village is grandfather's treasure!
I'm going to protect it!

129
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,797
First, in a mission where
a Four-Man Cell must act alone

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,467
for a long period of time
in enemy territory,

131
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,305
by deploying one of the four
to be a medical specialist,

132
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,474
the survival rate as well as
the mission success rate

133
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,934
should go up significantly.

134
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,145
Therefore, establishing a framework

135
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,063
to foster Ninja possessing
advanced medical skills

136
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,606
and the development of
a medical institution

137
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,112
should be considered
an urgent task for the present!

138
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,575
Yes indeed, it's as you say.

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,036
But we're in the middle of a war now.

140
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,957
It takes too much time to
establish a medical framework.

141
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,543
And at present,
we don't have enough knowledge...

142
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,588
Enemies don't wait.

143
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,466
What did you say?! Hey, old man!

144
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,926
Then we'll never...

145
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,512
I agree with her.

146
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:42,225
I don't want the lives of the Shinobi
who died to be for naught.

147
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,187
There should be something
we can learn from that.

148
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,608
Excuse me!

149
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
Thanks for earlier.

150
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,822
What you said was right.

151
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,284
Umm...

152
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,662
It's late.
Shall I walk you home?

153
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,249
What? Is that okay with you?
Where's your home?

154
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,377
The other way.

155
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,212
Then don't bother.

156
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,257
I don't mind.
I also want to talk with you.

157
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,388
And I would always use this path to
the Academy to pick up my little sister.

158
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,722
I loved this path.

159
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,517
What? You loved?

160
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,146
Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf
was attacked at night one year ago,

161
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,398
my little sister was...

162
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,319
This man...is the same as me.

163
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,172
Tomorrow's mission will be
within enemy lines...

164
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,762
Fighting and losing cherished people
is not the only way for a Shinobi.

165
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,930
Uh-huh.

166
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,016
I'm living in a world of Shinobi
where death always hovers.

167
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,896
I want to risk my life to bring
this war-torn world under control.

168
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,276
I love this village and my comrades.

169
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,111
So I want to protect them.

170
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,451
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.

171
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,828
So I'll become the Hokage...

172
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,122
An existence that protects everyone...

173
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,334
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

174
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,052
Dan...

175
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,604
I'd like you...to take this.

176
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,070
Hang on, Dan!

177
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:04,075
Tsunade... I don't want...to die yet.

178
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,289
I have many things that I must...do.

179
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,749
Don't talk, Dan!

180
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,877
His kidney has been blown out...

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,214
It's futile even for Tsunade
who is known as one of the Sannin...

182
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:22,636
I...must not...die here.

183
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,806
It'll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.

184
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,936
So it'll be okay... You'll be saved, Dan!

185
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,605
Really?

186
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,399
Thank goodness...

187
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,070
Dan! Hang on!

188
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,530
Dan!

189
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,953
Dang it! Don't come out...

190
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,914
Stop... Please stop!

191
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,124
Stop... Stop...

192
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,544
Stop... Stop...

193
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,381
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

194
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,092
Stop, I say!
That's enough. He's dead!

195
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,457
You understand, don't you, Naruto...?

196
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,419
Ever since that day,

197
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,964
Lady Tsunade has been...
in a constant turmoil.

198
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,307
Naruto...?

199
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,311
I'm heading out...for training!

200
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,589
Oh, you are already at it, I see!

201
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,882
Hi, welcome!

202
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,092
Why are you here?

203
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,846
You're cold. Don't say that.

204
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,890
Master Jiraiya...

205
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:37,062
Shizune, could you leave us?

206
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,065
It's been a while.
I want to drink with her again.

207
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,360
Master, sake! And some radish!

208
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,486
Coming up!

209
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,742
I'm counting on you, Master Jiraiya.

210
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,040
Your radish is ready.

211
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,250
Ooh. This looks good.

212
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,801
At any rate, to think you'd still be taking
good care of that necklace...

213
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,138
I thought you'd have lost it
long since to gambling.

214
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,642
It's a memento of those two, right?

215
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,068
Is he on your mind...?

216
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,194
Who?

217
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,531
Naruto.

218
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,242
Not particularly...

219
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,746
Still, it's immature,
taking on that kid as an opponent...

220
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,792
He shouldn't be able to master
that Jutsu in a week, right?

221
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,712
That's not what's called a bet.

222
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,841
What's with the fit of despair?

223
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,845
It's not a fit of despair!

224
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,807
Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?

225
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,602
I can tell by looking at Shizune's face.

226
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,107
I don't know what kind of deal
he proposed,

227
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,943
but don't rush to a decision.

228
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,157
And...let me just tell you one thing.

229
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,326
The successive line of Hokages
have protected

230
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,788
the Leaf Village and those living in it.

231
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,376
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

232
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,004
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!

233
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,176
You're not someone who can't understand
the feelings of the previous Hokages.

234
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,181
Just try doing something
to betray the Leaf Village.

235
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,687
When that happens, I'll kill you myself!

236
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,025
It has nothing to do with me now!

237
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,029
A person who has experienced
the death of people close to them

238
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,239
and doesn't feel anything
is just a butcher.

239
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,618
You're different, aren't you?

240
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:01,456
No one cared for the welfare
of the villagers more than you.

241
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,209
At that time, too...

242
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,419
That's enough with the lecture!

243
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,092
Why...did you bring that kid?

244
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,054
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

245
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,099
He resembles him, doesn't he?

246
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,477
His age is about the same, too...

247
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,522
Not just that...

248
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,404
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

249
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,495
Geez, you do nothing, but reckless things.
Do you want to die?

250
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,666
You're still a Genin,
so on the battlefield just run away.

251
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,919
Don't tell a man to "run away"!

252
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,091
That dream... And his cockiness as well...

253
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:09,274
No good! Dang it! Dang it!
Tomorrow, for sure...!

254
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,279
My head hurts.

255
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,950
I totally got sick from drinking,
thanks to her...

256
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:28,710
It seems Naruto never came home
last night...

257
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,554
He's such a fool.

258
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,652
Why don't we make a deal?

259
00:19:55,445 --> 00:20:00,074
I'll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved...

260
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,120
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.

261
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,834
Don't you want to see those two,
Tsunade?

262
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,799
If I treat your arms...

263
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,719
What do you intend to do with them?

264
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,932
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village!

265
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,310
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk...

266
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,520
Their wishes...

267
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:33,191
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...
And dreams... Did you forget them?!

268
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,234
I'll be straight with you.

269
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:40,990
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

270
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,144
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

271
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:15,066
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

272
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,320
On your still shoulder

273
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,617
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

274
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:30,456
The city lights are like pieces of stars

275
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,128
That hold us together

276
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,841
"Each one of us

277
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

278
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,515
you say laughingly

279
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:53,646
but you look most dazzling

280
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,109
Like a comet,

281
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:04,282
like the rainbow after the storm

282
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:10,121
You bring light into

283
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,539
my heart

284
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

285
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:22,467
can be the answer

286
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:28,347
Let's promise

287
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,726
we won't cheat

288
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,104
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

289
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,943
Darn it! What am I doing?!

290
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,987
I fell asleep at such
an important time!

291
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,239
Moreover, today is the day
of the bet!

292
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,367
Meanwhile, I don't even know where
that old lady Tsunade has gone to!

293
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,871
My training is not completed yet...

294
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:57,585
I've got to play it by ear
and rely on a one-shot deal!

295
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,714
Next time: "A Dubious Offer!
Tsunade's Choice"
