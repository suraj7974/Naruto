1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:17,017
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,145
One more time

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,022
<=title>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,903
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,753
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,797
One more time

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,062
Assassin of the Moonlit Night

24
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,617
T-This guy...

25
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,082
Sasuke!

26
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,919
So we were too late...

27
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,591
Those guys...

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,310
Sa...Sakura...?

29
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,024
You guys...

30
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,943
T-This...

31
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,404
He probably fought recklessly...

32
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,282
like that time!

33
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,245
Sasuke!

34
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,832
Kakashi Sensei said there was nothing
to worry about with the bruise!

35
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,293
So tell me...Sakura...

36
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,211
Sakura!

37
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,880
What do you want?!

38
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,758
This guy... Who is he?!

39
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,387
His outward appearance
is different, but...

40
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,473
he's that guy called Gaara.

41
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,396
When I came into this world, I took the life
of the woman some might call my mother.

42
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,982
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi...

43
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,235
my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,

44
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,696
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,033
I was born a monster.

46
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,162
So that's what he was saying...

47
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,248
He's the one who hurt Sasuke...

48
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,917
Hey young girl!

49
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,378
I want you to know that
I'm not the fighting type!

50
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,423
I can see that by looking at you!

51
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,843
In any case,
I need to get away from here

52
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,597
and somehow take Sasuke to
where Kakashi Sensei is!

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,601
You...

54
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,647
Sasuke...!

55
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,775
Well! Your limit is two shots...

56
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,110
That's about it...

57
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,324
The third shot won't be activated...
Remember this well.

58
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,703
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate...

59
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,122
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,

60
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,874
but your Chakra will deplete to zero...

61
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,336
and in the worst case, you'll die!

62
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:24,223
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.

63
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,226
Especially in your case...

64
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,687
Is it the Curse Mark...?

65
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,860
If you let your hatred take over you,

66
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,113
and rely on the power
of the Curse Mark...

67
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,199
your development will stop there.

68
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,495
If that happens, you won't
be able to beat Itachi.

69
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,792
In any case,
I need to get control over this.

70
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,920
Sasuke!

71
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,923
I see you're...

72
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,427
the one I failed to kill that time.

73
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,433
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself...

74
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,936
And as long as there are others to kill...

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,397
I will never disappear.

76
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,111
L-Let's run! Everyone!

77
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,501
Die! Sasuke Uchiha!

78
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,507
Sakura!

79
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,353
Out of the way!

80
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,746
Sakura!

81
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,044
How could she stand
in the way of that Gaara...?

82
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:23,175
Darn! Darn!
What the heck should we do?!

83
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,514
Just with him, I don't want to...

84
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,642
Now, let me feel it!

85
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,152
Why...?

86
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,246
Gaara, Please calm down.

87
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,888
It's no use after all...

88
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,599
The sand gets in the way.

89
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,352
Gaara...

90
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,855
Yashamaru!

91
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,440
I may not look it,

92
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,318
but Lord Kazekage charged me
to look after your physical condition

93
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,821
as a member of medical corps
and to be with you.

94
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,324
Please do not do such things
in front of me.

95
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,997
Although the sand will protect you...

96
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,711
Yashamaru... I'm sorry...

97
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,008
Oh, this..? It's just a scrape.

98
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,928
A scrape...

99
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,972
Is it painful?

100
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,895
A little bit... But it'll heal in no time.

101
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,864
-Hey Yashamaru...
-What is it?

102
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,325
What is pain?

103
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,749
I've...never once had a wound so...

104
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,126
I wondered what it's like...

105
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,712
Well...

106
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,590
How can I explain it?

107
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,719
It's like it's distressing, or difficult...

108
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,598
In other words, to be hit or cut...

109
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,727
Maybe I should say it's a feeling
of not being able to bear it,

110
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,687
of not being able to stay normal...

111
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,273
I can't say it well,

112
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,902
but I suppose it means a situation
that's not very good.

113
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,040
Yashamaru...

114
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,500
Yes?

115
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:08,048
So, do you dislike me...Yashamaru?

116
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,189
People live their lives while
hurting others and while being hurt.

117
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,443
But it's not so easy for
people to dislike others.

118
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,782
Thank you, Yashamaru.

119
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,036
I think I sort of understand
what pain is now.

120
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,496
I see...

121
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:46,295
So...maybe I'm injured too?
The same as everyone?

122
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,631
I'm always...in pain.

123
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,634
I'm not bleeding, but...

124
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,595
I've been having a lot of
pain around...here.

125
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,829
Blood does flow from a wound
on the body

126
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,914
and the wound may appear painful.

127
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,251
But as time passes, the pain
naturally disappears.

128
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,212
By using medicine,
the healing is even faster.

129
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,800
But what's dangerous is
a wound of the heart.

130
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,178
Nothing has more trouble healing.

131
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,847
A wound of the heart?

132
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,434
A wound on the body and
a wound of the heart are slightly different.

133
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,521
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,

134
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,774
it doesn't heal for one's entire life.

135
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,785
But there is one thing that
can cure a wound of the heart.

136
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,039
However, this is a complicated medicine.

137
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,833
It can only be given to you
by another person.

138
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,086
What? What must I do to...?

139
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,547
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart.

140
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,383
That is...

141
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,387
love.

142
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,390
-Love?
-Yes.

143
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,353
H-How can I get it?
What do I need to do for this pain to be...?

144
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,690
It has already been given to you, Gaara.

145
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,775
Huh?

146
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,158
Love is...a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

147
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,788
to love and watch over that person,
just like my older sister did.

148
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,251
I believe that my older sister
loved you, Gaara.

149
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,756
Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living
person used for the purpose of attacks.

150
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,720
The sand which automatically tries to
protect you is like the love of a mother.

151
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,476
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother's will.

152
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:13,775
My sister...probably wanted to
protect you even more after dying...

153
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,071
Yashamaru...

154
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,031
What is it?

155
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,995
Thanks for what you did earlier...
for stopping me.

156
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,164
You are welcome.

157
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,544
You are a precious person
who is near me, Gaara!

158
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,779
Can you understand...my pain?

159
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,749
It tastes like iron...

160
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
Twenty!

161
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,541
Twenty-one!

162
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,183
Leaf...Hurricane!

163
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,814
How many did you take
down Kakashi?

164
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,107
Twenty-two.

165
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,694
Huh, it seems I win again!

166
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,407
That was my twenty-third.

167
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,034
Yeah, yeah all right...

168
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,495
That poser attitude of yours
still makes you cool!

169
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,456
That's the reason you are my rival!

170
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,334
– Let's go!
– All right!

171
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,645
Hey, Yashamaru...
I have a favor to ask!

172
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,022
What is it?

173
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,650
I want some ointment.

174
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,621
Sorry about earlier...
It must've hurt.

175
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,415
This is medicine.

176
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,667
If you want it...

177
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,877
Go home...freak!

178
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,284
Oh, what the...?!

179
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,161
Hey, be careful, you brat...

180
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,622
Y-You are...

181
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,627
– Again...
– Go home, freak!

182
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,755
-These eyes...
-Y-You are...

183
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,174
Why...? Why?!

184
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,177
H-Hey!

185
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,518
What the...? What's going on?

186
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,853
It's...it's Gaara!

187
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,355
Hey! This guy's dead.

188
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,622
Father...

189
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,097
As I thought... Things don't go well...

190
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,438
Why is it...that only I'm such a freak?!

191
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,692
What...am I?!

192
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,489
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart is love.

193
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,492
Yashamaru!

194
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,513
Huh?

195
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,686
Why? Why me...?

196
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,438
Why always me?!

197
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,634
Who...? Why...?

198
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,590
Well done...Gaara.

199
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,974
Yashamaru...!

200
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
It's those eyes...

201
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,702
What's the matter?
Weren't you gonna run away?

202
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,247
Sasuke...

203
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,417
Naruto...

204
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:19,177
What are these two...to you?!

205
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,059
T-These two are...my friends!

206
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,646
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!

207
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,856
I'll clobber you!

208
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,285
So...what's the matter?!
Weren't you gonna clobber me?

209
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,623
Hurry up and come at me...

210
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,507
Darn it!

211
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,812
Everyone makes mistakes

212
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,067
It's nothing to be ashamed about

213
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't let this scar be for naught

214
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:27,036
Walk with a smile

215
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,677
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

216
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,099
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

217
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:53,146
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

218
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:58,401
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

219
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:03,489
Everyone makes mistakes

220
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,703
It's nothing to be ashamed about

221
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:14,042
Don't let this scar be for naught

222
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,338
Walk with a smile

223
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:24,552
Transform sadness into the wind

224
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:29,891
and continue to forge on

225
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:35,605
Forge on strong

226
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,036
I know this guy's strength.

227
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,624
I may seem like a senseless
weakling to him.

228
00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:00,630
But...what's...?
What's this feeling welling up inside me?

229
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,256
I don't know...

230
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,304
I don't know,
but I just don't want to lose to this guy!

231
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,017
Next time: "Light vs. Dark:
The Two Faces of Gaara"

232
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,019
