1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,387
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,141
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,644
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,609
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,319
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,533
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,579
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:43,627
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,214
Now open your eyes and

11
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:51,010
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,819
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,281
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,546
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,974
Hey...don't you want to see it?

22
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,812
It's about time.

23
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,273
What?
You know what I'm talking about.

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,735
Kakashi Sensei's...real face!

25
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,030
What are you doing?!

26
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,157
That's stupid!

27
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,909
I'm not interested.

28
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,328
Today's mission is over,
so I'm going home...

29
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,205
Yeah, I agree...

30
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,166
Aw geez... It sounds like fun.

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,504
Maybe he has...

32
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,422
lips like cod roe?

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,176
Lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,471
lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,
lips like cod roe...

35
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,653
Take one more push!
Or maybe a buckteeth?!

36
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:38,200
Buckteeth?!
Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?!

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,546
Gotta See! Gotta Know!
Kakashi Sensei's True Face!

38
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,009
But this is rare...
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!

39
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,221
All three of you treating me...

40
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,599
Snow might fall...

41
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,436
– Great success!
– Great success!

42
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,147
You know what I mean?

43
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,608
Here! Thanks for waiting!

44
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,695
All three of you treating me...

45
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,781
Snow might fall today?

46
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,617
Or if it's not that...

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,078
– Great success!
– Great success!

48
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,873
Maybe it's that...

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,334
Here! Thanks for waiting!

50
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,338
All three of you treating me...

51
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,674
Snow might fall today?

52
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,884
Or if it's not that...

53
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,179
are you guys up to something...
or not?

54
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,480
– Great success!
– Great success!

55
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,775
...like that.

56
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,444
Or if it's not that,
are you guys up to something?

57
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,366
Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!

58
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,410
K-Kakashi Sensei, we're celebrating
your release from the hospital!

59
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,998
N-Now! P-P-P-lease eat, eat!

60
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,961
All right...
Then I'll eat it without hesitation.

61
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,421
Thank you for waiting.
The pork slices are our treat.

62
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,351
Thanks for the treat.

63
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,190
Oh! Sasuke...
What a coincidence!

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,568
Get away! Ino Pig!
Wha...?!

65
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,779
Aw man! I can't see at all!

66
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,241
I'm finished! That was good...

67
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,826
– So fast!
– So fast!

68
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,661
Huh? Something wrong?

69
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
N-Nothing's wrong.
Hey!

70
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,126
– Huh?
– Huh?

71
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,047
– Wow! I'm really curious!
– Wow! I'm really curious!

72
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,265
Now, I will not allow myself
to be denied a glimpse of him!

73
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,559
But how are you
going to see it?

74
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,269
That's...

75
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,108
We'll see it somehow...
I'm asking you how! You idiot!

76
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,863
Then, then, do you have
a good plan, Sakura?

77
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:21,989
That's...

78
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,491
We'll follow by completely marking him.

79
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,577
If we do that, he'll eventually
take his mask off.

80
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,954
Sasuke, you are really bright.

81
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,623
What's that big deal?
That was so average!

82
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,710
Did you say something?
Well, that's fine.

83
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,348
What's Kakashi Sensei doing?

84
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm disappointed in him.

85
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,144
He noticed us!

86
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,897
Stupid Naruto!
We were found because of you!

87
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,732
I tell you it's not my fault!

88
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,275
What?!

89
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,404
I-It's being made into a movie?!

90
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,450
I'm going to go buy
an advance ticket.

91
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,368
Hey, he's begun to move!

92
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,287
We'll follow his track!
Yeah!

93
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,710
What? He's gone!

94
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,088
Darn, he got away...

95
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,965
Darn it, where did he go...?

96
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,343
What are you guys doing?

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,262
Do you guys have
some business with me?

98
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,181
– N-Not really...
– N-Not really...

99
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,691
Hey, how did he find us out?

100
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,152
Isn't it because there
are too many of us?

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,115
If the presence is erased,
the number of people shouldn't matter!

102
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,202
Or...have you forgotten the Jutsu?
Sakura...

103
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,912
That's you!

104
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,748
It will be good training to shadow him.

105
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,334
From now on,
we'll go about it individually.

106
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,921
Y-Yeah, let's just leave Naruto here!

107
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,047
What?!

108
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:11,515
And Junko then says...
"Oh, I am losing you."

109
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,987
What? What?

110
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,791
He got away...
Clumsy as usual...

111
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,710
You idiot...

112
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,919
Sorry.

113
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,266
Gosh, what is Kakashi Sensei doing?

114
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,311
He hasn't moved for
such a long time...

115
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,980
No way!

116
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,462
Sasuke! How did it go?!

117
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,298
No more shadowing.

118
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,977
Off we go!

119
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,730
Today's mission is to help at a farm.

120
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,441
The mission itself is not a big deal.

121
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,194
We're definitely going to look at it...

122
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,821
– Kakashi Sensei's real face!
– Kakashi Sensei's real face!

123
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,909
What's the matter?

124
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,911
You guys seem to have
lots of energy today.

125
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,497
– I have lots of energy!
– I'm ready to go!

126
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,292
Oh, that's excellent.

127
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,006
I've finally found you...

128
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,929
Kakashi Hatake!

129
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,182
Kakashi...

130
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,935
It has been a long while,

131
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,646
but I will settle
my long-standing grudge!

132
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,024
Boss, what is your grudge?

133
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,985
Fool! Have you forgotten?!

134
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,654
I cannot forget.

135
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,407
It happened in the spring
of three years ago...

136
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,033
No!

137
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,912
You don't need to be that scared.
No!

138
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,875
Our boss says he has something
to talk to you about...

139
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,335
Your boss?!

140
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,141
I love you... Please marry me!

141
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,310
– Boss is so cool!
– Boss is so cool!

142
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,770
No...
There's no need to be embarrassed.

143
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,608
You can be honest and
fly into my arms.

144
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,611
No...

145
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,990
Don't worry.
Even though I look like this,

146
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,616
I have a tidy sum of money!

147
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,577
I am telling you, no!

148
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:23,248
What? You're turning me down
in these surroundings?

149
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,792
When I say no, I mean no!

150
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,129
I made it such a romantic setting,
but why?

151
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,131
I don't like what I don't like!

152
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,383
Why don't you stop it around there?

153
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,885
– Huh?
– Huh?

154
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,599
Hey, the girl doesn't like it
and no matter how you look at it,

155
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,851
you're being rejected, buddy.

156
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,227
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,979
You're pretty gutsy.

158
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,982
Do you understand who we are?!

159
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,403
Are you challenging us, knowing that
we are the Moya Ninja Threesome...

160
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,739
fearsome enough to silence
a crying child?!

161
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,700
Moya Ninja? Never heard of it.

162
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,702
You don't know Moya Ninja?!

163
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,288
How dare you make fools of us!

164
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,706
Who the hell are you?

165
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,834
It's not worth enough to introduce, but...

166
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,711
Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.

167
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,755
– You're introducing yourself!
– You're introducing yourself!

168
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,383
Hey you...
You're going to regret it.

169
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,011
For getting in the way of
someone's romance!

170
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,179
Romance?

171
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,890
Isn't it just an annoying,
one-sided love?

172
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,893
Enough!

173
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,770
Men! We're going to attack!

174
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,854
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

175
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,232
4...3...2...1...

176
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,109
– Hustle! Hustle!
– Hustle! Hustle!

177
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,372
Please! Somebody help me!
Hey! I can't stand heights!

178
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,456
I'll take you back to the village.

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,541
Stop talking! Hey!

180
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,628
Hey, quit sighing!
What, are you just leaving us here?!

181
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,839
That's how it went...

182
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:54,923
– Don't be so proud!
– Don't be so proud!

183
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,675
– You lost!
– You lost!

184
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,052
So it means revenge from
three years ago!

185
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,430
Boss has become stronger
in the last three years,

186
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,641
and he's going to beat him up
in a face-to-face match!

187
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,226
That's so dramatic!

188
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,188
Fool! Who would take such risk?!

189
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,815
Huh?

190
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,150
If we're going to do it,

191
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,777
we'll do it stealthily from
the shadows! Stealthily.

192
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,531
– D-Dirty!
– D-Dirty!

193
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,452
Welcome!

194
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,329
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

195
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,414
Welcome!

196
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,589
Incredible!

197
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,215
Looks delicious!

198
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,300
How extravagant.

199
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,219
Please take your time...

200
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,852
Kakashi...

201
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,813
Now eat, this will be
your last dinner party.

202
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,192
That meal contains
a tasteless and odorless medicine

203
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,820
that causes uncontrollable hiccups.

204
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:03,366
Just keep on having
the ceaseless hiccups and die suffering!

205
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,995
It's a fitting end for you!

206
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,959
Something wrong?

207
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,711
Not one of you has
even laid chopsticks on the food.

208
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,132
Not really, but why don't you,
Kakashi Sensei, hurry up and eat?

209
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,219
Well, I'm on a diet.

210
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,638
Figured he'd say something like that.

211
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,850
Then I'll strip off that mask
if it kills me!

212
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,729
My hands slipped...

213
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,702
How could you!

214
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,205
Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally...

215
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,415
– What do you mean "unintentionally"?!
– What do you mean "unintentionally"?!

216
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,377
What a pity! The meal...

217
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,756
– How could he do such a thing?!
– How could he do such a thing?!

218
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,842
Hey, what's the next move?

219
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,929
Don't worry. I have an idea.

220
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,514
– An idea?
– An idea?

221
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,649
I see, this is pretty good thinking
for Sasuke.

222
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,985
A person would normally
take off the mask here.

223
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,404
Never mind that.
Just be quiet, you idiot!

224
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,911
Kakashi, you will die here!

225
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,205
From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,

226
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,960
coated with medicine I prepared
that will make you laugh uncontrollably...

227
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,807
You'll die laughing...

228
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,102
That is the fitting way for you...

229
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,146
Darn...

230
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,859
I wanted to see it too,
but this is a hot spring...

231
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,402
But I want to see!

232
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,698
Kakashi Sensei!
Aren't you ready yet?

233
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,034
All right, I'm coming in now.

234
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,036
I do want to see it!

235
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,415
Here he comes!

236
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,417
Great!

237
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,085
Oh, I can't see at all!

238
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,937
Thanks for waiting.
I'll just soak for a little while.

239
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,691
– Why is it like this?!
– Why is it like this?!

240
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,568
Now!

241
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,403
Huh? Something wrong?

242
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,739
And slowly, I sink in.

243
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,169
What the...?!

244
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,381
What happened?
I want to know!

245
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:16,101
What in the world is
Kakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?

246
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,320
Darn, I'm completely flushed... Huh?

247
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,199
– Our clothes are gone!
– Our clothes are gone!

248
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,711
Please come again!
Please come again!

249
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,920
Thank you for coming!

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,132
Please come again!
Please come again!

251
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,220
Crap...I'm going to
definitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.

252
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,890
But it was great that
we brought spare clothes.

253
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,894
I wonder who took them away...?
Our clothes!

254
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,858
All right,
each of you work at your own posts.

255
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,234
Now, break up.

256
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,779
I can't stand it anymore...

257
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,615
I have too much stress stored inside.

258
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,285
I'm almost at the end of
my patience as well...

259
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,413
Sasuke...actually, me too...

260
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,125
Then, it's the last resort!

261
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,127
– Last resort?
– Last resort?

262
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,837
What is this?

263
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,090
Can't you see? It's Shinobi outfit.

264
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,176
When did you get this ready?

265
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,887
Well, well, never mind that,
never mind that.

266
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,597
What do you do with this?

267
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,851
We'll strip away the mask.
Even if we have to use force!

268
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,150
Darn Kakashi...

269
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,860
Boss! Look at that!

270
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,156
Hey, Kakashi Hatake!

271
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,909
Hey, what are you guys up to?

272
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,412
W-What are you talking about?
We are simply Ninja.

273
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,539
It is not that we want to see
what is behind your mask...!

274
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,626
Fool! Don't say unnecessary things!

275
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,544
That's...!

276
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:10,757
Boss! There's somebody else besides you
who holds a grudge on Kakashi!

277
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,300
Now is the chance!

278
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,593
Right! Let's go!

279
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,844
– Right!
– Right!

280
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,096
Stop right there!

281
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,268
Kakashi! It's time for you
to pay for your crime!

282
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,479
You shall die!

283
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:29,609
With this medicine I prepared
that will make you cry... What?!

284
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,782
Oh, just when I thought how long
you guys were going to sneak around...

285
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,575
you finally come out.

286
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,536
Ah, well, you know...

287
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,039
But before that,
Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!

288
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,126
Why are you guys dressed like that?

289
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,671
Huh?! Well, yeah, so...

290
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,297
Oh no...

291
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,007
We have to make up an explanation,
whatever it is!

292
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,593
Caught you!

293
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,848
We were well aware that
you three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!

294
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:05,562
What?! Then our plot was exposed
from the beginning!

295
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,149
Of course!
This was a trap to lure you guys out!

296
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,484
We caught you off guard!

297
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,195
So we were completely caught
in the trap.

298
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,323
Darn! We underestimated you,
thinking it was kids!

299
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,534
I never heard that story!

300
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,286
Nice, Sakura!

301
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:25,039
I don't quite get what's happening,
but oh well...

302
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,463
– Please forgive us!
– Please forgive us!

303
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,674
There's no use talking...

304
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,676
– O-Oh no!
– S-Stop!

305
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,394
It's the same as three years ago!

306
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:51,149
This time, we're hung by just one rope,
combined with the same movement.

307
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,860
By the way, who are you guys?

308
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,362
– And he doesn't even remember us!
– And he doesn't even remember us!

309
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,581
Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
Yeah?

310
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,709
What is behind that mask?

311
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,170
What? You wanted to see
what's behind this mask?

312
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,254
Yeah!

313
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,381
Then you should have said
that from the beginning...

314
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,926
Well, can you show us?

315
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,178
I don't mind...
What the...?!

316
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,554
Sure thing.

317
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,476
All right...

318
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,147
Is it like cod roe?

319
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,777
Buckteeth?

320
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,406
Or a tiny mouth?

321
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,867
Behind this mask...

322
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,328
– Behind that mask...
– Behind that mask...

323
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,083
There happens to be another mask!

324
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,542
– What?!
– What?!

325
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,132
What...?!

326
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,177
What in the world is that?!

327
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,353
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

328
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

329
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,820
On your still shoulder

330
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,492
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

331
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

332
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

333
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,757
"Each one of us

334
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:44,512
glows differently,"

335
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,348
you say laughingly

336
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:53,604
but you look most dazzling

337
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:58,234
Like a comet,

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:04,282
like the rainbow after the storm

339
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:11,372
You bring light into my heart

340
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

341
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:22,633
can be the answer

342
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:29,807
Let's promise we won't cheat

343
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:34,395
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

344
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,859
Begging your pardon!
Begging your pardon!

345
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,946
I was born and raised in the Leaf Village
in the Land of Fire.

346
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,865
My given name is Naruto,
and the surname is Uzumaki.

347
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,825
People call me...
"The No. 1 Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja"!

348
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,952
I'm not "the No. 1 Hyperactive
Knucklehead Ninja"!

349
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,121
What's this
you've been practicing?

350
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,083
We're going to meet with
Boss Wasabi.

351
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,377
A proper first greeting's important!

352
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,257
Next time: "Mission:
Help an Old Friend in the Land of Tea!"
