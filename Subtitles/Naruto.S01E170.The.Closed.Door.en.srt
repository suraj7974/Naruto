1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and
gather the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long
way to go on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards
the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,320
*There was something beyond
that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,227
Where's Naruto?
It's no good. I can't find him.

16
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,853
I see...

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,065
He's not close by anymore.

18
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,860
Either he drifted away...
or he has escaped.

19
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,657
At any rate, with this fog...

20
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,119
There's no reason to
remain here any longer.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,916
Let's make it to a shore nearby
and start again.

22
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,000
Understood.

23
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:20,766
The Closed Door

24
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,565
It's been a while, Lord Orochimaru.

25
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,567
It truly has.

26
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:35,030
To think I'd stop by on
a whim to find you still here.

27
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:40,035
And it's for that reason that
I am able to meet with you again.

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,415
So does the fact that
you're here mean

29
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,959
you're still continuing that research?

30
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,502
Yes.

31
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:51,463
And I think someday it will be
of help to you, Lord Orochimaru...

32
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,174
I wonder if that's true.

33
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,512
And all this is due to my loyalty.

34
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,891
Do whatever you like...

35
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,809
Thank you.

36
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,105
By the way... is he the one you were
talking of earlier?

37
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,109
Yes, he's Itachi Uchiha's
younger brother.

38
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,653
Oh really...

39
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,947
Yes, my...

40
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,449
Please don't...

41
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,119
say anything unnecessary!

42
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,064
It appears that Naruto
is no longer close by.

43
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:37,194
Hey...
Naruto, surely he's safe, isn't he...?

44
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,030
He can't be beaten that easily.

45
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,993
After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi...

46
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,957
Shiragiku Inn
I'm responsible for guarding
the ships collecting funds.

47
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,419
I'm Hitode.

48
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,130
I know the circumstances,

49
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,466
your colleague has disappeared
and I'm sure that you're worried...

50
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,803
Have you received
any information since then?

51
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,181
I'm sorry, but there's been
no information

52
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,933
regarding a victim rescued
from a shipwreck.

53
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,476
I see.

54
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,478
However, I'm troubled.

55
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,733
This is difficult to say,

56
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,193
but the departure of the collection ships
has been pushed forward...

57
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,987
Pushed forward?

58
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,906
Now we're scheduled to
leave tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,994
We apologize for
our late notice.

60
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,621
As expected,
a large number of people find

61
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,457
the relationship with
Land of Water very important

62
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,835
and we had to push
the departure forward.

63
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,337
I understand.

64
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,049
But we'd like to take time here

65
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,509
to seek and investigate
our colleague...

66
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,261
Of course.

67
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,306
We'll meet you directly
at the port tomorrow

68
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,016
for the guard duty.

69
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,643
Thank you for cooperating.

70
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,564
Just one thing.
Yes...

71
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,526
As you can see, we are
not a very wealthy country.

72
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,529
Fishermen and we are
both concerned

73
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,115
about the disturbance of
this Demon of the Ocean.

74
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,619
We greatly appreciate for
your help with our country.

75
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,080
I understand.

76
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,894
That's right, I...

77
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,482
You've come to?
Y-Yeah...

78
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,027
Hey, you're the girl
from yesterday...!

79
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,615
I get it now!
You saved me, thank you!

80
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,909
It just happened...

81
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,037
No, seriously you saved me.

82
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,041
Oh, I'm Naruto Uzumaki.
What's your name?

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,293
Isaribi.

84
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:02,005
So Isaribi, you're the girl
who saved my life.

85
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,305
Why did you come to
this remote area?

86
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,850
A mission, of course!

87
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,561
To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean
that has been troubling this country!

88
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,772
It would be best to quit.

89
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,733
You won't get away easily if you get
involved with the Demon of the Ocean.

90
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,446
You don't need to worry.
Anyway, this is a mission.

91
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,699
We were careless yesterday,

92
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,951
but next time we'll catch that
Demon of the Ocean...!

93
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,202
That's hot!

94
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,997
So...you feel fine now?

95
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,334
Yep! Thanks to you,
it's excellent, believe it!

96
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,545
Then, once you've eaten that,
get out.

97
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,965
Huh? What? What?

98
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,145
Wait, Isaribi!

99
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,732
Hey! Isaribi... Wait...

100
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,110
Huh, wha...?

101
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,279
Monster! Go away!

102
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,363
What's this?

103
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,241
It's the work of some brats
from the village.

104
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,452
If I let it bother me,
there's no end to it.

105
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,996
Oh, Isaribi...

106
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,333
Really, thank you so much.

107
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,094
She's out, the monster!
What the...?

108
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,138
Get out of here!
You're bad luck

109
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,723
Take this!

110
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,227
I-Isaribi... Stop it, brats!

111
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,395
– Disappear!
– Get out of here!

112
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,521
Say something!

113
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,614
Hey, stop! All of you!

114
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,742
You're taking your pranks
a little too far!

115
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,329
Who are you?!
A friend of this monster?!

116
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,249
Monster?
Everyone's saying it.

117
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,793
Isaribi was spirited away

118
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,753
and became friends with
the Demon of the Ocean!

119
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,546
Don't say such irresponsible things!

120
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,466
It's true!
Ouch!

121
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,343
– Run!
– Stupid guy!

122
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,387
– Hey! Who you calling stupid?!
– Stop!

123
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,222
What?! But...

124
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,808
It's okay...

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,310
Leave me alone.

126
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,021
I can't leave you alone!

127
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,731
If they keep doing that...

128
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,733
I'm saying that it's none
of your business!

129
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm the girl who was
spirited away.

130
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,284
So it's natural that people
find me creepy.

131
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,913
But that's not your fault!

132
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,248
That doesn't matter.

133
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,919
Humans don't let those who are
different from them into their group.

134
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,422
So...

135
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,586
Your colleague was lost at sea...

136
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,006
We thought that if a boat left port
between the evening and morning

137
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,133
maybe they saw something...

138
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,386
Sorry, but I don't think
I can help.

139
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,888
Because of
the Demon of the Ocean,

140
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,807
people of this village stay away
from the port at those times.

141
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,642
I see.

142
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,269
He's been spirited away.

143
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,232
That Demon of the Ocean
took someone away again.

144
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,526
Mother, don't say such reckless things.

145
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,028
Spirited away...

146
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,030
I heard that at the port, too.

147
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,617
Can you give me details about
this spiriting away?

148
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,579
What good will talking
about it do?

149
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,290
But...
Please forgive me.

150
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,460
This isn't something to be
talked about with outsiders.

151
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,921
Can we do something
about that, please?

152
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,799
We came here to exterminate
the Demon of the Ocean.

153
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,759
Exterminate the Demon
of the Ocean?

154
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,179
I see...

155
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,099
For a long time,

156
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,310
there's been a legend among
fishermen on Demon Island.

157
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:26,978
A legend?

158
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,524
Yes, the legend says
don't come near Demon Island,

159
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,402
"the island where demons live."

160
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,948
Demon Island has always been
a fishing area rich in fish,

161
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,243
but there were many hidden reefs
and it was a dangerous marine area...

162
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,371
So everybody obeyed the legend.

163
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,916
But one unusually cool summer
about ten years ago,

164
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,751
the fish disappeared from the sea...

165
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,671
We couldn't help it,

166
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,799
so my husband and I set our feet
into the dangerous marine area.

167
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,095
It was a large catch.

168
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,349
But when I happily came
to the surface of the ocean,

169
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,353
I saw an empty boat with
my husband nowhere to be seen.

170
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,398
Ever since then, one after the next,

171
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,026
anyone who approaches
that island disappeared.

172
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,321
Also, people who went
to search didn't return.

173
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,450
Since then people from the village
stay away from the island

174
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,993
where spiriting away occurs.

175
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,871
An island nobody goes near...

176
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,706
That's a peculiar story.

177
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,624
Speaking of which, I heard that

178
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,085
there's a girl who returned
from being spirited away.

179
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,838
Oh, yes... Isaribi.

180
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,423
Ma'am, I've got another favor.

181
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,842
Please tell me where she lives!

182
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,015
Lady Tsunade...

183
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,517
Lady Tsunade!

184
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,564
Geez. Here's the data you requested.

185
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,942
That's the Land of Sea's...

186
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,487
You're worried, after all.

187
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,572
Hm... Well, yes...

188
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:06,912
The Land of Sea is where Anko,
abandoned by Orochimaru, was found...

189
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,011
Hey! Are you okay!

190
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,352
It's no good... I can't remember.

191
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,729
Even though I should know...

192
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,357
It's dark and cold...

193
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,319
I was in pain... But...

194
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,323
Calm down...
Try taking a little more time.

195
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,993
I'm sure I even got this strange mark
while there...

196
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,038
The suggestion is deep.

197
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,290
Her entire memory is most likely all...

198
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,719
That's enough...
You've had some tough times.

199
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,349
It's okay.

200
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,436
Right now, we'll treat this
Curse Mark that's eating away at you...

201
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,980
We have to do that first.

202
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,190
Lord Hokage...

203
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,442
I...

204
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,945
In the end, her memory didn't return...

205
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,199
A part of Anko's memory
remains lost even now.

206
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,743
So that's what happened...

207
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,542
So, this is the first time Anko's been
to the Land of Sea since that incident?

208
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,086
Yes... That's right.

209
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,090
It would be nice if
it could be a catalyst

210
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,925
for bringing back her memories...

211
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,558
What?!
Missed each other?!

212
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,810
They came here?!

213
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,688
Yeah, you should follow
them right away!

214
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,857
And, which way did they go?

215
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,650
That way!

216
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,905
That's the direction I came!

217
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,575
Damn! Everybody wait up!

218
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,301
The collection ship is moving.

219
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:33,099
I see, the only girl who returned
from being spirited away.

220
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,810
I thought we should at least go see...

221
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,981
She may have some information
about Demon Island!

222
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,525
Stop!

223
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,826
Oh! That girl!

224
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,745
Sensei!

225
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,164
I wonder where she intends to go?

226
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,672
She's cautious.

227
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,800
Let's follow without being noticed.

228
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,485
Hey, everybody! Oh, c'mon.

229
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,195
If I keep going like this,

230
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,864
I'll go all the way to
Isaribi's house again.

231
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,141
That appearance...

232
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,726
It can't be,
you're the Demon of the Ocean...?

233
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,528
What?!

234
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,327
I won't let you escape!

235
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,304
Master Orochimaru...
This is...?

236
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,682
I'm going to teach you
something special.

237
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,269
This is one of the rooms
where I develop Jutsu...

238
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,773
I'd like you to help, too.

239
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,526
But...if the village knew about this...

240
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,030
It's not going as smoothly as I hoped.

241
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,199
It only needs one more step...

242
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,704
Silly, there's nothing to be afraid of.

243
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:06,085
The really frightening thing is
to neglect pursuing the truth.

244
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,593
That girl, could she be...?

245
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,788
Give it up! You can't escape!

246
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,499
You were the Demon of the Ocean!

247
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,962
Hey, everyone!

248
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,297
Hey!

249
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,385
I finally found you!

250
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,638
Naruto, you're safe...

251
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,057
But Naruto, you're too late.

252
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,433
Too late?

253
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,938
We caught the Demon of the Ocean!
Look, this is it.

254
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,320
Huh, so this is
the Demon of the Ocean?!

255
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,206
Isaribi...
Huh?!

256
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:32,213
Isaribi... You're Isaribi, aren't you?!

257
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,174
Naruto! What are you talking about?!

258
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:40,263
Just wait! Isaribi!
Isaribi, answer me!

259
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,516
Damn it!
Wait up, you!

260
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,810
Wait, don't be rough.

261
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,522
Explanation must wait. We're in trouble if
we let her escape here.

262
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,415
Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!

263
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,876
Like that will happen!

264
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,836
She's an important guinea pig.

265
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,840
If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.

266
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,766
Bastard!

267
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,310
Don't chase too far...
It'll be yesterday all over again.

268
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:30,772
But!

269
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,112
Crap!

270
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,079
No question about it...

271
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,415
That girl...

272
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,421
Sensei!

273
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,887
What in the world is going on?!

274
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,197
The wind blows, Ah...

275
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,701
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

276
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,620
What should be brought along?

277
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,206
Assemble them into a piece.

278
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,377
There is no second chance, never

279
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,338
How foolish it is to throw away

280
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,341
Acting so innocently, Ah...

281
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,218
The images.

282
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:49,017
It probably will not end

283
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,356
It probably will not end

284
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,111
Burn that love-filled heart,

285
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,406
Sail across a thousand dreams

286
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,242
Running freely

287
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,954
To take hold of the world in hand

288
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,124
The clouds scatter

289
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,127
The sun sets yet again

290
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,508
The solo parade begins to move.

291
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,763
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

292
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,348
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

293
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,276
Geez! What the heck
are you thinking?!

294
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,861
What do you intend to do alone?!

295
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,447
But I can't just leave her be!

296
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,741
Even if you were to go after her,

297
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,034
you don't even have any leads
in the first place!

298
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,328
No, not quite!
– What?!
– What?!

299
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,831
It seems there's an island at
the center of this land's spiriting away.

300
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,541
I get it. Demon Island!

301
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,378
Let's go after her! As for me,
I can't just leave her be, believe it!

302
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,715
Next time: "Infiltration: The Set-Up!"
