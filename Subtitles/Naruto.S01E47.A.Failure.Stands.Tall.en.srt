1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,128
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,797
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,075
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,593
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:37,097
Withdraw! You're not suited
to being a Shinobi.

21
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,354
You don't have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,023
Hinata, give it to him!

23
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,153
Naruto...

24
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,490
Don't just take it! Argue back!

25
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,367
I'm getting irritated watching this!

26
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,665
Naruto...

27
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,377
Thank you!

28
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,421
The expression of her eyes
has changed...

29
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,258
So you're not going to withdraw?

30
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,843
I'm not taking responsibility
for what happens...

31
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,637
I don't want to run away!

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,848
Byakugan!

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,479
Brother Neji! I challenge you!

34
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,871
Here!

35
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,918
A Failure Stands Tall!

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,961
As I thought, this is the extent of it...

37
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,047
the head family's power!

38
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,591
What the...?!

39
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,135
But Hinata laid a perfect strike!

40
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,849
N-Not yet...

41
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,571
What's with this guy...!

42
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,991
I-It can't be...

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,369
Well, now...

44
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:08,165
I guess this is why he's called
the most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.

45
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,854
Y-You mean... All this time...?

46
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,942
That's right! I can see
the Chakra Points.

47
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,653
W-What is he talking about?!

48
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,446
On the Chakra Network...

49
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,950
there are 361 energy centers
or Chakra opening,

50
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,911
each about the size
of the head of a pin.

51
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,247
They're called Chakra Points.

52
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Theoretically, hitting one directly
can halt or increase Chakra flow,

53
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,342
enabling one to gain complete control over
an opponent's flow of Chakra.

54
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,595
Just so you know,

55
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,558
not even my Sharingan
can see Chakra Points!

56
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,021
Having the penetrating eye
is one thing,

57
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,857
but to hit it so accurately like
that during a match, well, that's just...

58
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,996
Lady Hinata...

59
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,915
What we have here is an unchangeable
difference in abilities.

60
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,543
It's what distinguishes
the elite from the failure.

61
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,965
It is brute, unalterable fact.

62
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,760
You were destined to regret having said

63
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,596
that you don't want to run anymore,
the instant you said it.

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,767
And now, you must have
abandoned yourself to despair!

65
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,188
This is your ultimatum...

66
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,274
Withdraw!

67
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,986
I-I...

68
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,245
I-I meant it...

69
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,832
and am...sticking by...

70
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,129
every word...

71
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,465
Hinata...

72
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,301
I said!

73
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,387
I'm not gonna run away!

74
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,434
Because that's...my Way of Ninja!

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,755
I had no idea...Hinata was this tough...

76
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,090
She's a lot like you.

77
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,886
Come to think of it...
She's always watching you.

78
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,221
Huh?

79
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,309
Hinata...

80
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,193
Bring it on!

81
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,205
She has reached her limit.

82
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,584
One more blow and...

83
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,763
Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points

84
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,516
have completely halted
her flow of Chakra.

85
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,770
That means she can no longer
send Chakra

86
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,815
into her opponent's body
to fight in the Gentle Fist.

87
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,027
This match is as good as over.

88
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,364
But I never imagined there would
be someone this powerful...

89
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,995
I'm afraid even our Sasuke
is no match for him.

90
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,166
It looks as if Neji may very well
take this Exam.

91
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,210
It's going to take more than what
this girl has to bring him down.

92
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,514
L-Look at those eyes...

93
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:39,478
Is he going to try to kill her?
No, no, that's absurd.

94
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,230
Doesn't it seem that...

95
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,523
Neji's strength is somehow
against the rules?

96
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,067
He's just too powerful...

97
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,401
I mean it!

98
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,367
Go, Hinata!

99
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,372
Naruto...

100
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,959
Strength has come back
into her eyes...

101
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,046
I've been watching you...

102
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,221
I've been watching you closely
for many years now!

103
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,560
Why I wonder...?

104
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,484
Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!

105
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,903
What a pain!

106
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,989
It's all your fault!

107
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,782
Like I care!

108
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,577
Okay!

109
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,040
Naruto... d-do your best.

110
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,417
Transformation!

111
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,212
I don't know why, but...

112
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
I am Naruto Uzumaki!

113
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,937
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you!

114
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,981
Is that perfectly clear?!

115
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,781
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you? Yeah, right!

116
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,700
That idiot.

117
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,745
He made a roomful of enemies
in the space of an instant.

118
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,584
When I watch Naruto...

119
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,174
Naruto, stand up!

120
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,060
If you compete with me
for the name of Hokage...

121
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,522
You... will be the loser!

122
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,942
I can feel courage welling up.

123
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,406
I feel that I can hang on,
that I can do it...

124
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,578
that I too am worth something!

125
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,541
– No!
– Hinata!

126
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,347
Hinata...

127
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,434
At some point, Hinata, who was
in the habit of just giving up,

128
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,770
made up her mind to change.

129
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,317
Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.

130
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,406
She put every ounce of
her being into her training.

131
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,658
I saw it with my own eyes.

132
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715
But even so, she continued
to fail all her missions.

133
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,968
She lost her nerve when
faced with real competition

134
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,386
and became easily discouraged.

135
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,267
But today's Hinata is different.

136
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,436
I have never...

137
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,730
seen...that look in her eyes before.

138
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,859
Naruto.

139
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,446
I have always done
the watching up to now,

140
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,740
but, now, finally...

141
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,493
finally, I am...

142
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,162
Naruto!

143
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,957
You just don't get it, do you?

144
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,836
Your strikes were ineffective
from the very first.

145
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,006
It's the end.

146
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,097
Hinata... That's enough.

147
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,599
You lost the match,

148
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,518
but you've become a new person
in the process.

149
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,020
You did well.

150
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,485
I want to change that about myself...

151
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,237
So I proposed it myself...

152
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,994
Neji's final blow went
straight for the heart.

153
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,413
I feel sorry for her, but she won't be
standing again now.

154
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,975
As further fighting is not feasible
under these conditions...

155
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,726
Don't stop it!

156
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,065
Don't stop the match!
Believe it!

157
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,400
Naruto, stop!

158
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,235
What on earth are you saying, stupid!

159
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,904
She's had it. You can see
she's unconscious...

160
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,490
Huh?

161
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,242
Why do you stand up?

162
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,455
If you continue like this,
you'll really die!

163
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,167
He is now finally for
the first time truly seeing me.

164
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,045
I will not be caught looking bad...

165
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,006
Why?!

166
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,134
in front of...

167
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,887
the person I admire most.

168
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,524
I-I am far from finished!

169
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,985
Give up the bravado...

170
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,238
I can tell you're just
barely standing.

171
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,116
You've shouldered the lot
of having been born

172
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,786
to the head family line of the Hyuga...

173
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,624
And cursed and blamed
yourself for being weak...

174
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,670
But, people cannot change.

175
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,588
That's just the way it is.

176
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,175
There is no need for you
to suffer any more! Surrender to it!

177
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,806
You're wrong...Brother Neji.

178
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,018
Because I can tell...

179
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,690
that you are suffering
much more than I.

180
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,652
What?! You are the one who is torn up

181
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,532
over the fate of head
and branch family.

182
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,791
Neji, the match has been called!

183
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,251
Oh boy!

184
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,556
Neji, get a hold of yourself!

185
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,725
You promised me

186
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,893
you wouldn't let the head family
thing get you riled up!

187
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,980
Why are all the other Jonin
butting in?!

188
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,357
The head family gets
special treatment, eh?

189
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,488
Hinata?!

190
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,866
Hinata!
Hinata!

191
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,911
Hinata! Are you okay?!

192
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,163
Hey!

193
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,000
Naruto...

194
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,168
Yeah.

195
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,173
I...

196
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,222
Do you think...

197
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:43,855
I...changed maybe a little bit?

198
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,068
Hey you, failure!

199
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,656
I have two pieces
of advice for you.

200
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,201
First, if you intend to
call yourself a Shinobi,

201
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,036
stop that revolting cheering of yours.

202
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,206
And the second...

203
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,793
a failure will always be a failure.

204
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,544
There's no changing that!

205
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,716
Do you want to see about that?

206
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,145
You!

207
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,315
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

208
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,152
But all fighting must be
done officially in a match!

209
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,866
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort...

210
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,369
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

211
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,623
Though, I am probably going
to be the one fighting Neji...

212
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,878
but it would be okay with me
if you ended up fighting him, Naruto.

213
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,927
All right already.

214
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,975
So this is okay then,
right, Guy Sensei?

215
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,603
Lee! You...

216
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,022
Nice going!

217
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,373
Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.

218
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,960
Was he trying to kill her then?!

219
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,462
The precious little time you have
would be better spent

220
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,715
seeing to her than glaring at me.

221
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,342
Medics!
Hurry! What's taking so long?!

222
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,552
S-Sorry.

223
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,432
Get her on the stretcher.
One, two, three.

224
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,935
It's serious. She 's got about
10 minutes at the most!

225
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,646
Get her to the emergency room.
Pronto!

226
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,772
Out of the way!

227
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,336
Hinata...

228
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,981
Because that's my Way of Ninja.

229
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,615
I promise you.

230
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,261
I will win no matter what!

231
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,186
Hey, can you hear it?

232
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,939
The clear

233
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:18,695
blue sky goes on and on

234
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:26,577
The ocean spans limitlessly

235
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:35,712
Please keep that smile on your face forever

236
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:42,969
Or else I'll cry

237
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,306
You won't have to search around you

238
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,436
It's all ok now.

239
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,607
Everyone is inside

240
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,194
this hand

241
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,241
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

242
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,829
When you forget what happiness is

243
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,833
Just sing.

244
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:19,047
Light is born, and darkness was born

245
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,340
The two are one

246
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:27,972
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

247
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:33,269
Hey, can you hear it?

248
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,858
The Absolute Defense of the Sand?

249
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,736
They say no one has
ever injured Gaara.

250
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,988
He's strong as heck and
has no weak points.

251
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,615
Bushy-Brows is no match for him...

252
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,493
But wait, he's not losing!

253
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,994
He seems a lot faster than before.

254
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,330
Is this due to his training?

255
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,290
I am getting excited about it!

256
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,378
Next episode: "Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!"

257
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,173
I'm just a little envious of that training.
