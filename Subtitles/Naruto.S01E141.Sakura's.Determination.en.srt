1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,091
Hey boys,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,345
listen up!

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,475
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,938
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
You're not old enough

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,879
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,965
All the kids said

11
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,706
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,712
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:35,805
Sakura's Determination

22
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,433
Where's Sasuke!
Where did you put him?!

23
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,895
You're Naruto, right?

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,400
You wouldn't believe anything
I said anyway, would you...?

25
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,821
That's right! I won't believe
that Sasuke's dead!

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,614
Naruto...

27
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,203
That's right. Sasuke is alive.

28
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,039
I'll bring Sasuke back!

29
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,584
I made that promise!

30
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,086
Naruto...

31
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,506
In that case, take me down!

32
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,884
If I were the wimp I was in the past,

33
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,220
I would probably have
told you the truth.

34
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,680
Arashi!

35
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,517
No! The old Arashi is dead!

36
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,104
The person you see here
is just a block of flesh

37
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,691
kept alive by
Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!

38
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,831
Sakura, please look after Sasame!

39
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,958
Stop it, Naruto! Don't fight with Arashi!

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,042
No!

41
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:52,298
This guy isn't the same gentle Arashi
you once knew, Sasame!

42
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,217
Jigumo! Go!

43
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,559
No!

44
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,561
Sasame! I'm sorry!

45
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,647
Over here!

46
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,203
Naruto!

47
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,371
Don't, Sakura!

48
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,545
Kamikiri...!

49
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,759
Finish him!

50
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,223
Naruto!

51
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,072
You're...next...!

52
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,368
Sakura!

53
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,424
That was close...

54
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,596
I almost let my guard down.

55
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,684
Just when you had a chance
to launch a sneak attack.

56
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,145
You blew it, didn't you, Naruto?

57
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,438
Naruto!

58
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,733
All because of that ball and chain...!

59
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,112
Ball and chain...?!

60
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,157
Naruto... I'm sorry!

61
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,702
That's not true at all!

62
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,915
This kind of injury...

63
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,668
is nothing...at all!

64
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,337
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

65
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:57,840
If there's three on your side,

66
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,758
I'll go with five on mine!

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,608
Kamikiri!

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,584
Naruto!

69
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,924
Are you all right?!

70
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,388
You're badly hurt...

71
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:50,434
Sakura... This injury is nothing!

72
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:55,606
"Sakura...This injury is nothing!"

73
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,239
Stop it! If you say more than that...!

74
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:09,244
I won't say more! I'll bring this to an end.

75
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,082
Kamikiri! Jigumo!

76
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,710
Give me your Chakra...

77
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:28,263
Boar, Dog, Rat,
Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,

78
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:35,145
Dog, Monkey, Dragon,
Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon...

79
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,066
Why does Arashi know that technique?

80
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,238
It's a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs
of the Fuma clan could use...

81
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,989
What was that?!

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,993
Fuma Ninja Art:

83
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,829
Spell of the Mandala!

84
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,289
This ain't good!

85
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,130
Naruto!

86
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,842
What the heck is this?!

87
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,802
This is the end!

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,309
What?!

89
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,273
Naruto!

90
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,360
The Chakra cage gradually shrinks...

91
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,407
And the human enclosed therein
is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.

92
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,743
You can't break it.

93
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:36,874
As long as I myself do not
dissolve the Jutsu.

94
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,129
Naruto!

95
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,102
I'm incapable of doing anything...

96
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,481
There's nothing I'm capable of doing...

97
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,821
The person I am now isn't...

98
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,948
capable of doing anything!

99
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,913
Arashi!

100
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,967
Sasame...

101
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,595
You!

102
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,722
Sasame!

103
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,517
Please...come to your senses...

104
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,605
Become the old Arashi again!

105
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,399
I told you, already!

106
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,444
The old Arashi is dead.

107
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,420
Arashi...

108
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,340
I'm sorry, Sasame...

109
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,844
I wanted power...

110
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,350
I wanted the Fuma Clan to find
a place in the sun once again...

111
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,354
Yes! I understand that!
I understand that!

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,277
But, enough now...
Let's go home.

113
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,071
Let's go back to the village.

114
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,242
But, I'm just a mere monster now...

115
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,952
That's not true!

116
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,204
This is agony...

117
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,665
Sassme...

118
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,253
Please... kill me...

119
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,007
Please...kill...

120
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,263
How dare you try to kill me!

121
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,265
Arashi!

122
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,102
You'll...die!

123
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,245
Sakura!

124
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,497
Sakura?!

125
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,709
You wanna be... the first to die?

126
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,380
Sasame taught me that...

127
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,924
dying isn't anything to be scared of!

128
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,718
I see...

129
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,225
But what's scary is to live one's life
without having been able to do anything...

130
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,397
I'm not afraid to die in the service
of someone who is important to me!

131
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,690
Don't!

132
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,986
I'm telling you...

133
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,948
Whatever happens, you mustn't die...
No matter what! Sakura!

134
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,658
Naruto!

135
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,911
Give it up!

136
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,288
What is it you think you're capable
of doing the way you are now?!

137
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,215
That's so useless!

138
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,056
Vanish from this world
get crushed into nothing...!

139
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,893
-Sasame!
-Stop that, Arashi!

140
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,020
Sasame...you!

141
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,787
-Naruto!
-Hey! Let go!

142
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,038
No!

143
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,740
Arashi?!

144
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,118
I'm sorry, Sasame...

145
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,455
I caused you so much hardship...

146
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,248
No, you haven't!

147
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,461
The person who experienced
the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!

148
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,007
Is there anything I can do for you?

149
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,301
What should I do for you?!

150
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,762
You've already helped me
more than enough...

151
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,265
See... Thanks to you, Sasame,

152
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,601
I was able to return to being
the person I was in the past...

153
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,941
Naruto!

154
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,279
Sakura...

155
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,616
Even if it's to be of service
to someone...

156
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,953
There's no life that
should be lost for that!

157
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,624
Yeah!

158
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,920
Run! Sakura!

159
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,179
Pervy Sage!

160
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,306
Sorry to be late!

161
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,851
I was faced with a number of obstacles
on my end too!

162
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,978
Gimme a break...

163
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,897
Now then...
Climb on, climb on!

164
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,943
Hurry! Let's get back above ground!

165
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,452
Oops!

166
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,537
Sasame!

167
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,041
She's fine... She just fainted.

168
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,170
Naruto!

169
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:03,843
Orochimaru assigned us a mission...

170
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,096
To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back

171
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,557
to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves under any circumstances!

172
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,351
Then, Sasuke is...?!

173
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,229
Yeah... He's alive!

174
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,107
Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke

175
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,070
because he is his vital vessel which
he will possess in three years!

176
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,908
Arashi...

177
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,245
Arashi... This place is gonna collapse!

178
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,663
Hurry up and come over here!

179
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,841
I'm already just a puppet...

180
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,176
I cannot live my life anywhere
except here.

181
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,387
Arashi...

182
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,271
-All right!
-No! Arashi!

183
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,900
Sasame...

184
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,779
Thank you.

185
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,594
Including Arashi,
we've paid an extraordinary price but...

186
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,888
The Fuma Clan has been
able to cut itself free

187
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,806
from Orochimaru's spell...

188
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,809
You can start again anew.

189
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,229
I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!

190
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,652
With this life...
that Arashi protected.

191
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,407
Yeah!

192
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,620
I am truly indebted to you.

193
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,497
Sasame...

194
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,752
Hanzaki, I'm leaving these two
in your hands!

195
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,546
Yes, sir!
Please take care along the road!

196
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,507
I will.

197
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,135
-Thank you!
-We thank you!

198
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,595
-Take care!
-See you again!

199
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,972
Hey! Hang in there!

200
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,356
Well, we weren't able
to find Sasuke,

201
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,067
but at least we now know
that he's alive somewhere...

202
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,945
We'll have to settle for the fact
that we were able to ascertain

203
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,407
the new information that we still have
a grace period of three years

204
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,660
before he becomes a vessel
to be possessed by Orochimaru.

205
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,745
Yes...

206
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,917
Sasame knew what she needed
to do for her clan...

207
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,504
But this time again all I did was cry.

208
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,091
All I did was depend on Naruto...

209
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,467
Sakura!

210
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,679
You gave your best effort too!

211
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,892
No, I was just a ball and chain
to everyone...

212
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,978
I wasn't capable of doing
anything alone...

213
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,772
That's not true!

214
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,611
Seeing you give your best effort
like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.

215
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,243
If you hadn't been there, Sakura,
I'd have been crushed just like that.

216
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,621
It's thanks to you, Sakura!

217
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,707
Naruto...

218
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,545
Wow, you've grown into someone
who can say that sort of thing!

219
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:32,135
Oww! I'm an injured man!
Treat me with a little more care!

220
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,345
Oh yeah, that's right!

221
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,770
All I was thinking about at that time
was protecting someone I cared about...

222
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,987
What I'm capable of
doing right now...

223
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,037
I was thinking...

224
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,371
What?

225
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,501
There are many variables such
as mission level,

226
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,629
or platoon's member structure...

227
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,215
But no matter how small
a platoon might be,

228
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,302
I think it's important to assign
one Medical Ninja to it...

229
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,012
I know that already...

230
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,224
I wrote exactly the same thing
in a report long ago

231
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,602
regarding the survival rate and mission
achievement rate of small platoons.

232
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,523
But it's not that easy to
nurture Medical Ninja.

233
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,654
They require a different set of skills
than that of fighting types Ninja...

234
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,783
The minute perfection
of Chakra control,

235
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,202
the ability to assimilate a huge volume
of specialized knowledge,

236
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,622
the brains to apply that in a broad way...
patience...

237
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,083
And there is the most important thing

238
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,711
for Shinobi who are to develop
into a Medical Ninja...

239
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,300
Well, I'm busy right now, so...

240
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,139
The most important thing...huh?

241
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,644
Hidden Leaf Hospital
I'm all wrapped up in bandages again...

242
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,730
This way I can't even
hold chopsticks...

243
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:13,152
Sakura, when it's time for
my meal, feed me, okay?

244
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,196
I'll open up my mouth just like this and...

245
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,907
Huh? Sakura?

246
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,290
I'm sorry! I was just joking!

247
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,458
I'm sorry... Naruto...

248
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,877
Huh?

249
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,300
This is gonna mean that
I'll keep you waiting a little but...

250
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,220
Next time, I definitely won't...

251
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,391
be a ball-and-chain to you!

252
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,857
Huh?

253
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,111
Enter!

254
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,869
I came here with a request!

255
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,871
What is it?

256
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,249
Please make me your apprentice!

257
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,357
You're very desperate, aren't you?

258
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,026
Sakura Haruno,

259
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,488
I heard from Kakashi that you have
a brilliant mind as well as will power!

260
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,910
All right.

261
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,790
But in exchange,
I'm not gonna be easy on you!

262
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,916
Yes, ma'am!

263
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,256
This recent mission...

264
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,261
looks like it wasn't wasted
on her, after all.

265
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:15,316
When I recalled the parts one by one,

266
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,823
I felt as though
I had understood everything

267
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,411
Faded words

268
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:32,583
which I kept so close to me

269
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:38,131
Speechless nights,

270
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,051
a hint of warmth,

271
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:49,183
and this distant yearning for you

272
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,145
I live,

273
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:58,151
simply repeating this cycle

274
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,032
Held in my two hands

275
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:09,871
A droplet of time

276
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,754
Softly clutching forgotten memories

277
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

278
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:33,019
I'll keep these thoughts...

279
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,359
He makes me so angry,
that Pervy Sage!

280
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,403
Didn't he say "I'll make you
my disciple and hone your skills"?!

281
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,614
When Sakura's already become
the Old Lady Tsunade's

282
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,907
and is working so hard!

283
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,117
And he just leaves me to
my own devices! Hey!

284
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:54,791
All because he was assigned
a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!

285
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,793
If things come to this,

286
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,962
I'm gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade
a piece of my mind!

287
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,715
Next episode, "The Three Villains
from the Maximum Security Prison"
