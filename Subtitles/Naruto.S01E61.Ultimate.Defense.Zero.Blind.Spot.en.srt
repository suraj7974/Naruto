1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,268
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,228
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,797
One more time

23
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,065
His opponent is that Neji, huh...?

24
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,026
The Final Round is altogether different
than the preliminaries...

25
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,654
After all, Naruto may not be able to...

26
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:15,344
Entertain me a little, Naruto.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,683
I've got a tough job waiting
for me now, so...

28
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,772
Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!

29
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,602
Dang it. I can't catch him at all.

30
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,690
I told you I'm not
such a fool, didn't I?

31
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,198
I already know...

32
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,160
which one is the real one.

33
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,920
That is the body
that has least attacks

34
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,381
due to its fear of having
Chakra Points attacked.

35
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,550
The more you attack,

36
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,427
the more that one body
becomes clearly evident.

37
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,266
You're the real one.

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,060
Naruto...

39
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,728
This is as far as it goes.

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,568
I said it was pointless.

41
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,115
Don't let him beat you, Naruto.

42
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,625
I've been telling you not
to frivolously assume things.

43
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,754
What? It can't be.

44
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,971
All right! Go, Naruto!

45
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,473
Naruto...!

46
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:29,895
He foiled my idea and purposely
and drew one of his clones back?

47
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,817
I've been striking from the beginning,
prepared for an honorable death!

48
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,943
Believe it!

49
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,278
I did it.

50
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,828
That's...

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,094
W-What was that?

52
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,139
Did you think you'd won?

53
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,767
Why?

54
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,061
Naruto's punch should've hit.

55
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,522
That...

56
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,361
Rotation...

57
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,325
That's Neji's defense.

58
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,786
You punk.

59
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,955
Don't make a fool of me.

60
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,213
The largest range of vision of
Neji's Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.

61
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,260
And he detects all of his opponent's
attacks with the Byakugan.

62
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,305
His defense technique,

63
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,725
the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
will begin from here.

64
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,913
The moment he's attacked,

65
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,374
he discharges a large amount of Chakra
from the Chakra holes in the body,

66
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,877
blocks the enemy's attack with that Chakra,

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,590
moves his own body in a circular motion,
dodges and repels.

68
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,221
Essentially, it's difficult to control
the Chakra discharged from Chakra holes...

69
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,181
To the extent that even Jonin utilize
the discharge from a part of the body,

70
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,810
like the hands and feet,
in techniques.

71
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,230
But Neji who has mastered
Gentle Fist discharges Chakra

72
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,900
from his entire body and
shuts out physical attacks

73
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,361
just with that discharge power.

74
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,988
In other words,

75
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,825
that's one more absolute defense

76
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,244
that has more power
than that Gaara's Sand Shield.

77
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,128
T-That's father's...

78
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,382
The Rotation is a secret Art passed down
from generation to generation

79
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,717
only to the Hyuga head family,
in other words the Hyuga clan.

80
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,388
He created that on his own...?

81
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,392
He's quite the guy...
To think he'd come this far.

82
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:19,648
It's much too soon to be surprised.
Neji's true power is still to come.

83
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,484
Dang it.

84
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,194
This is the end.

85
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,158
You're within the area of my 8 Trigrams.

86
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,212
Gentle Fist Art.

87
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,549
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.

88
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,385
It can't be. That pose.

89
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,604
8 Tetragrams...

90
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,439
...2 Palms!

91
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,610
4 Palms.

92
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,154
8 Palms.

93
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,740
16 Palms.

94
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,492
32 Palms.

95
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,039
64 Palms!

96
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:25,088
The branch family exceeds
the head family?

97
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,270
It's over.

98
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,987
Truly a terrifying talent.

99
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,782
To think the power of the
Hyuga Kekkei Genkai

100
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,451
would be passed on so strongly
to a child of the branch family

101
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,746
who would never be able
to be an heir.

102
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,752
Hizashi... You should have
succeeded the Hyuga family.

103
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,632
I pressed the 64 Chakra Points
all over your body...

104
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,676
You can't even stand.

105
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,764
D-Dang it.

106
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,433
Are you frustrated?

107
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,270
Kneeling down before power
that can't be changed

108
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,146
and knowing your powerlessness.

109
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,484
Your dreams will come true
if you just work hard.

110
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,194
That's just an illusion.

111
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,949
Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?

112
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,535
Oh, man. I knew it.

113
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,869
Naruto.

114
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,152
Bushy brow...

115
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,989
Hinata.

116
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,373
D-Dang it.

117
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,667
Oh.

118
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,884
Naruto.

119
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,606
He... No way.

120
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,652
I told you, didn't I...?

121
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,031
I don't know when to give up.

122
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,209
No way.

123
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,547
Hey, you're bleeding.

124
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,632
What's wrong?

125
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,761
You've still got damage
from the match.

126
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,139
Hinata... Hang in there.

127
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,021
I'll take a look at her.

128
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,524
Who're you?

129
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,985
I'm not suspicious or anything.

130
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,571
Stop already...

131
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,740
It'll be the same even if
you fight more than this.

132
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,617
I don't have a grudge particularly
against you.

133
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,453
S-Shut up...

134
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:47,165
Even if you say so,
I have something against you.

135
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,959
What are you talking about?

136
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,213
Why...? Here you're this strong...

137
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,633
Why did you, with a look like
you've seen through it all,

138
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:02,931
go after Hinata mentally
who was trying so hard?

139
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,143
It has nothing to do with you.

140
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:11,731
Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling
her a failure as you please.

141
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,650
Head family, branch family...

142
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,611
I don't know what happened to you.

143
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,993
But I won't forgive the jerk who'd
call another person a failure.

144
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
Hey, you.

145
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,461
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

146
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,965
Okay... Fine.

147
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,925
If you insist,

148
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,387
I'll tell you about
the Hyuga's destiny of hatred.

149
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,391
In the Hyuga head family,
there's a secret Ninjutsu

150
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,185
that's been passed on
from generation to generation.

151
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,354
That is the Curse Mark Arts.

152
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,899
Curse Mark Arts?

153
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,200
The Curse Mark represents
a bird in a cage...

154
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,829
and it's a mark of those who are
bound to a destiny they can't escape.

155
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,469
W-What's...

156
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,482
...t-that mark?

157
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
One day when I was four years old,

158
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:44,199
this accursed mark was inscribed
on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.

159
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,081
A large ceremony was held in
the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.

160
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,918
It was also the day when the
head Ninja of the Land of Lightning,

161
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,462
the land that the Leaf had
fought with for many years,

162
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,882
came for the conclusion
of the allied treaty.

163
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,886
However, there was one clan...

164
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,556
who didn't attend the ceremony
that was attended

165
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,267
by everybody else,
from Leaf Jonin to Genin.

166
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,353
It was the Hyuga clan...

167
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,398
And it's because that day
was the day of hope

168
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,650
when the head family heir
was to turn three.

169
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,281
Miss Hinata's third birthday!

170
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,588
My father, Hizashi Hyuga,

171
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,924
and Miss Hinata's father who's over there,

172
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,593
Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.

173
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,222
However, Miss Hinata's father,
Lord Hiashi,

174
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,726
is the eldest son of the head family
born into this world first.

175
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,272
And my father who was the second son
is a member of the branch family.

176
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,027
So Miss Hinata is already three...

177
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,821
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

178
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,540
She's a cute girl, isn't she, father?

179
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,465
What's wrong, father?

180
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,177
Oh, it's nothing.

181
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,388
Then...

182
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,849
I'll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.

183
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,351
Yes.

184
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,897
When the head family heir grew
and became three years old,

185
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,153
I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me
and I became the bird in the cage.

186
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,197
And became the Hyuga branch family.

187
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,116
Why's it necessary to do
something like that?

188
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,702
Why separate into a head family
and a branch family?

189
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,623
What does that weird mark mean?

190
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,543
This mark on my forehead
isn't just a decoration.

191
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,681
-The pull of your legs is weak.
-Yes.

192
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,106
Listen, Neji.

193
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,110
You will live to protect Miss Hinata
of the head family

194
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,405
as well as the Hyuga power.

195
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,699
Yes, father.

196
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,888
Murderous Intent.

197
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,648
-My head.
-Father.

198
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,112
What's wrong, father?

199
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,531
Go home.

200
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:15,076
I'll forgive the fool today only.

201
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,038
You're not to forget your destiny.

202
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,796
This Curse Mark is the absolute fear
called death so to speak...

203
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,007
that was given to the branch family
by the head family.

204
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,344
The Secret Sign that the
head family members form easily

205
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,806
destroys the cerebral nerves
of those in the branch family.

206
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,059
Of course, killing is easy.

207
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,023
And this mark only goes away
at time of death.

208
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,276
Sealing away the power
of the Byakugan.

209
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,785
The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses
the most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.

210
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,331
There's no end to those who
target the secret of that distinctive power.

211
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,712
In other words, this Curse Mark
keeps the branch family alive

212
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,132
only to protect the head family
and does not allow disobedience.

213
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:15,553
And it's an effective system created
to defend for eternity

214
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,597
the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.

215
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,432
And then,

216
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,894
that incident occurred.

217
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,647
My father was killed

218
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
by the head family.

219
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,616
One night, Miss Hinata was
snatched up by someone.

220
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,437
At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately
rushed off and killed the abductor.

221
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,776
Who do you think that person was...
who was in the shadows,

222
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,738
and also wearing a mask?

223
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,493
It was the head ninja of
the Land of Lightning

224
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,996
who had just completed
the allied treaty.

225
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,709
It was clear that he came targeting
the secret of Byakugan from the start.

226
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,211
However, the Land of Lightning

227
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,173
exploited the killing of their own Ninja
due to a botched plan...

228
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,384
and set an outrageous condition

229
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,636
in violation of the treaty
with the Hidden Leaf.

230
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,854
Naturally, things got worse and worse,

231
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,480
and there was almost a war
between the Leaf and the Lightning.

232
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,443
However, the Leaf who
wanted to avoid war

233
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,570
made a deal with the Lightning.

234
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,572
A deal?

235
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,325
The Lightning demand was
the body of the Hyuga head family

236
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,536
who possesses Byakugan,
the Kekkei Genkai...

237
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,249
In other words,
the body of Lord Hiashi.

238
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,713
And the Leaf accepted the condition.

239
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,758
What? But, father...

240
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,637
And war was safely avoided.

241
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,181
Thanks to my father

242
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,768
who was killed
as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,

243
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,896
to protect the head family!

244
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,943
Other than dying, there's no other way
to escape this accursed Curse Mark.

245
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,072
Even though they were twins
with nearly equal power,

246
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,324
their destinies were already set

247
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,078
by who was born first and born later.

248
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,543
And then, this match...

249
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,465
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.

250
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,400
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

251
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,861
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

252
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,281
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

253
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,660
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

254
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:32,208
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

255
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:38,214
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

256
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,924
Fight! Fight! Fight!

257
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,146
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

258
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,607
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

259
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,986
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

260
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,531
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

261
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:09,746
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

262
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

263
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,086
Fight! Fight! Fight!

264
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:23,634
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

265
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:29,682
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

266
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,100
Fight! Fight! Fight!

267
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,735
Are all my Chakra Points
really closed?

268
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,114
Darn. I cannot feel any Chakra
remaining in my body at all...

269
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,910
just like when I used up all my Chakra
in my training with the Pervy Sage.

270
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:53,581
Wait. I got it. Just watch me!

271
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,667
I will squeeze out
my Chakra no matter what!

272
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,879
Next time, "A Failure's True Power."
