1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,351
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,228
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,797
One more time

23
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,955
Your destiny is to lose to me.
For sure.

24
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,043
You don't know until you try!

25
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,681
Your father was killed a long time ago

26
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,350
and I don't know the extent
of the pain you've felt...

27
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,810
But

28
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,523
it's a huge mistake for you to think
that has determined your entire destiny!

29
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,693
You're hopeless...

30
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,214
Proctor...it's over.

31
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,388
You failure...

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,772
A Failure's True Power

33
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,281
Don't...run away.

34
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,039
I won't...run...

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,251
I'll...stand by my own words...

36
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,088
That's my Ninja Way!

37
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,095
I'll...

38
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,599
stand...

39
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,561
by my own...

40
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,481
words!

41
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,735
That's my...Ninja Way...

42
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,198
I think I've heard that line before...

43
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,785
You with your destiny stuff...

44
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,995
I won't lose...

45
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,165
to a jerk with cold feet like you,
no matter what!

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,418
Naruto...

47
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:21,011
A brat who knows nothing
shouldn't lecture arrogantly!

48
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,972
People are born burdened

49
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,475
with an inherent destiny
that they cannot defy.

50
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,651
Neji...live...

51
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,736
You're a man who is blessed
with Hyuga ability

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,864
more than anyone in the family...

53
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,247
I wanted you...to be born
into the head family...

54
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,881
You can't possibly understand
the destiny of being burdened

55
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,883
with a mark that cannot be wiped off
for life!

56
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,427
Yeah...

57
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,388
I do understand it.

58
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,478
So...what of it?

59
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,064
This brat!

60
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,693
Don't be acting cool...

61
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,656
It's not just you who's special!

62
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,912
Hinata was also...

63
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,625
suffering the same as you!

64
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,961
Even though she's the head family,
not being acknowledged as such...

65
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,963
trying desperately to change herself...

66
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:27,179
She fought you while coughing
up blood with that in mind!

67
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,681
You too!

68
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,643
The branch family that
protects the head family...

69
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,145
Doing all that to Hinata
just because it's an exam.

70
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,815
In actuality, you were just as frantic

71
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,734
in attempting
to go against destiny, right?

72
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,168
Vitality has returned to Hinata's face!

73
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,130
Just what I'd expect of
the Anbu Black Ops...

74
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,798
She'll be okay.

75
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,093
Now she needs bed rest.

76
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,319
Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut...

77
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:29,074
How are you, who can't use Chakra
for awhile, planning to fight?

78
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,163
At the end of the day,

79
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,748
you and Miss Hinata have
the same destiny!

80
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,376
Shut up!

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,171
With your Byakugan, labeling people

82
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,506
and talking like you understand!

83
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,717
Then...

84
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,013
show me whether what
you're saying is true or not.

85
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,098
I will!

86
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,102
I'll defeat you no matter
what and prove that to you!

87
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,356
Dang it... Dang it!

88
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,402
That being said, I don't feel Chakra at all.

89
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,364
It feels like when I used up
my Chakra in the training.

90
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,581
You possess two kinds of Chakra...

91
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,793
You must extract and utilize, at any time,

92
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,756
the other huge Chakra that
has rested inside you from the start...

93
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,345
That's it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra...
I'll use that...

94
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,778
Stinking fox...
Help me out!

95
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,369
This is as far as the talking goes.

96
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,120
Proctor...

97
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,249
I'm going to fight with
the intent to kill him!

98
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,210
If you're going to stop me,
please feel free.

99
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,171
Jeez.

100
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,054
Didn't I tell you it is pointless?

101
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,645
This time, I really can't lose!

102
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,108
I'll win no matter what!

103
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,569
It's futile...I pressed the Chakra Points...

104
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,532
No matter what...

105
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:39,329
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come
watch me kick that Neji's butt!

106
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,171
A failure beats down
a genius with effort...

107
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,216
His opponent might be me...

108
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,554
But even if that's you, Naruto,
no hard feelings.

109
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,985
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?

110
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,910
Because I was called...

111
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,872
a failure!

112
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,976
No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.

113
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,770
What's the meaning of this...?

114
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,704
H-He...!
What in the world...?!

115
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,761
W-What is he...?!

116
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,555
It can't be... This Chakra!

117
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,975
T-That's...impossible!

118
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,941
No way! His Chakra Points
have been pressed!

119
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,372
This Chakra...
It's the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt...

120
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,125
When did he master
the Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra...?!

121
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,978
Here I go!

122
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,753
It's twisting...

123
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,719
What's that?!
Is that even Chakra?!

124
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:04,242
Awesome power.
More so than during the training...

125
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,331
I feel it!

126
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,226
Rotation!

127
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,656
What?!

128
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,285
His speed's gone up!
What in the world is going on?!

129
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,897
You!

130
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,860
You're confident in close combat, right?!

131
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,575
You're going to become the Hokage...?

132
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,703
I don't... think so.

133
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:35,584
Only a very small percentage of
Ninja are chosen to be the Hokage!

134
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,003
Look more at reality!

135
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,757
Those who become the Hokage
are born with destiny.

136
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,927
It's not something you become
by trying to become it.

137
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,972
It's determined by destiny.

138
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,224
People must live within
their different respective currents

139
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,561
that can't be gone against.

140
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:03,069
I don't know what the
Hyuga destiny of hatred is!

141
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,991
But if you're going to say it's futile,
you don't have to do anything!

142
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,909
This is bad! I must use the Rotation!

143
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,121
After I become the Hokage...

144
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,837
I'll change Hyuga!

145
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,134
What Chakra...

146
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,888
That kid showed some enormous strength...

147
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,683
The Hyuga kid is probably...

148
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,526
Say! Which one's Naruto?!

149
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,862
I don't know, either!

150
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,762
Neji's Rotation is a technique
where the body rotates,

151
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,431
and dodges and
repels the opponent's Chakra!

152
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,225
It looks like there was
more damage done to Naruto

153
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,144
since he plunged right into the Rotation.

154
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,482
There's no Genin that can beat Neji...

155
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,193
But Naruto, you're incredible...

156
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,196
To think you'd force him this far...

157
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,952
Failure boy...
Sorry, but this is the reality...

158
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,413
Now this is really the en...

159
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,532
My body...

160
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,544
So he left a Shadow clone in the hole
and spotted a chance to win, huh...

161
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,797
Believing in victory,
thinking about what's next

162
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,841
and acting even when getting
knocked around, huh...

163
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,344
The power of believing in oneself.

164
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,805
That becomes the power
to change destiny...

165
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,893
He knows this...
And he's a natural to boot.

166
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,901
In those conditions,

167
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,528
you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu
just like that...

168
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,030
The Ninjutsu that you're good at, huh?

169
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,366
I was careless...

170
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,543
I've...failed the graduation
exam three times...

171
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,088
As luck would have it,

172
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,258
the Ninjutsu tests that appeared
on the graduation exam were always...

173
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,430
infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.

174
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:04,287
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu...
I stunk at.

175
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,922
Don't be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,

176
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,343
and how it can't be changed!

177
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,192
Because unlike me...
you're not a failure.

178
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,586

184
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:38,256

00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,170
Fight! Fight! Fight!

193
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:23,718
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

194
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:29,766
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

195
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,142

Yahoo! I've won! I've won!

197
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,569
Hey Naruto...

198
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,072
Don't you think I was so cool?!

199
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,408
Don't get so carried away!

200
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,659
Sakura...?

201
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,245
Sasuke hasn't arrived here yet.

202
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,290
What's up with that kid,

203
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,833
making Sakura worry so much?

204
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:01,464
