1
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,305
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,322
Is this really Moso's house?

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,826
Here he's a superintendant officer,

17
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,162
so I thought it'd be a more luxurious
building with gold folding screens.

18
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,832
Your voices are too loud.

19
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:08,379
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
with no self-interests.

20
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,216
So he lives frugally.

21
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,093
But you know, he's an old man

22
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,555
who's the second most important guy
in the land next to the feudal lord, right?

23
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,473
He smacks of being really poor.

24
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:20,933
Naruto!

25
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:32,736
Well well, how shameful of me
to present such a poor residence.

26
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,364
Lord Moso.

27
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,617
What?!

28
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,830
This old man like from
some dumpling shop?

29
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,085
I'm an old man from
a dumpling shop?

30
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,130
Geez, unbelievable!

31
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,715
Idiot!

32
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,550
What're you doing, Neji?!

33
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,511
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

34
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:02,266
So you are Ninja who came from
the Village Hidden in Leaves?

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,354
From the right,
this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.

36
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,901
I hear you encountered
the Cursed Warrior that appeared

37
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,320
in Lord Komei's residence last night.

38
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,363
Yes.

39
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,908
So, how did it go?

40
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,368
Did you figure out the true identity
of the Cursed Warrior?

41
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,204
Yeah, it's a real ghost.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,416
Oh, a ghost, huh?

43
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,543
Don't be jumping to conclusions
on your own.

44
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,964
0But he appears all of a sudden
and flies around.

45
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,551
Yeah, and on top of that,
the inside of his armor was empty.

46
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,013
No matter how bizarre the thing,
there's always a trick.

47
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,266
I'll pin down the true identity without fail.

48
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,311
That is encouraging...

49
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,774
We have just changed feudal lords
and the public is still anxious.

50
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,195
Please eliminate the rumors of
the Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.

51
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,447
I beg of you.

52
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,534
Please!

53
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,915
Tsurucho Yakitori

54
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,750
Here are your chicken wings.

55
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,585
Oh, here we go!

56
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,337
They look tasty!

57
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,048
Hot!

58
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:21,053
That Moso superintendant officer
seems like a good guy.

59
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,263
Yes. It was also Lord Moso
who came to my rescue

60
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,308
and selected me to be a page.

61
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,395
The son of the feudal lord succeeds him

62
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,147
and an excellent superintendant officer
offers him tutelage...

63
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,401
The government appears
to be stable, but...

64
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,487
Then why is there a strange rumor
going around

65
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,531
about the haunting
of the previous feudal lord?

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,951
There's probably somebody displeased

67
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,953
with this dramatic replacement
of the feudal lord.

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,126
Do you have any idea who it might be?

69
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,462
Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.

70
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,090
Isn't that the name of
the tactician you were talking about

71
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,884
who wanted to become the feudal lord?

72
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,514
Then why did the Cursed Warrior
appear in his residence?

73
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,142
Perhaps to deflect attention.

74
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,812
That's it.
I bet that's it.

75
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,689
All right, since it's come to this,

76
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,401
if we can nab that old man
called Komei or whatever

77
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,153
and quickly get him to own up...

78
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,489
,Guys, let's get fired up and
get going!

79
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,118
Idiot. We can't do something
like that without proof.

80
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,163
He is a tactician of this land
more or less, so.

81
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,374
Oh man, that's no fun.

82
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,087
First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord.

83
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,216
That's not possible. Lord Sagi
does not like to meet anybody.

84
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,345
Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud.
Let us meet him, okay?

85
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,390
You're a "nipple" friend, right?

86
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,517
If you're going to say that,
say, "childhood friend."

87
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,810
Huh?

88
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,122
Can we really meet him
in a place like this?

89
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,001
This lake holds fond memories
for Lord Sagi.

90
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,505
And...for me as well.

91
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,342
In our young days,

92
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,346
Lord Sagi always played with
his little sister Lady Toki here.

93
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,273
He might come here around about today
with his attendants...

94
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,484
If we're lucky.

95
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,278
It's up to luck, huh?

96
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,207
It's Lord Sagi.

97
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,903
Lord Sagi, we have arrived.

98
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,113
Thank you.

99
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,492
Oh wow...
So that's Lord Sagi, huh?

100
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,453
He's cute. He is kind of my liking...

101
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,060
My watch has remained stopped
since that time.

102
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,856
Hey, what's he doing?

103
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,025
He's probably reminiscing.

104
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,908
The only thing that can comfort
Lord Sagi's heart

105
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,619
is his memories with Lady Toki.

106
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,212
Byakugan.

107
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,215
Where is it?

108
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,175
Where's this bloodthirsty aura
coming from?

109
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,053
It's not above ground?

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,726
Could it be, underwater...?

111
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,108
Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!

112
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,199
I don't think so!

113
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,049
Who the heck are you guys?

114
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,932
Damn it!
I won't let you get away.

115
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,517
Wait, Naruto!

116
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,312
What is it?

117
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,777
A letter bomb in the water.

118
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,080
That was a close one.

119
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,292
If you'd chased after them as is,
you would've been totally entangled.

120
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,879
Settle down.

121
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,716
Lord Sagi!

122
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,010
Are you all right?!

123
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,845
Yes, I'm fine.

124
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,847
Thank goodness!

125
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:03,312
Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja
from the Village Hidden in Leaves...

126
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,523
They came to investigate
the true identity of the Cursed Warrior.

127
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,987
That was unnecessary.
I bet it was that Moso's idea?

128
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,533
It was all because
he was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.

129
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,202
The fact is, if these people
were not here now...

130
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,662
Silence.

131
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,997
Y-Yes, my lord.

132
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:27,336
Hey-hey, do you really not get
how this guy feels?!

133
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,297
Chishima was seriously
worried about you.

134
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,632
Without his passionate friendship,

135
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,844
the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn't have
taken action with that low commission fee.

136
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,263
I am not obliged.

137
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,307
How bothersome!

138
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,808
Say what?!

139
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,228
Friendship is in the past.

140
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,399
I became a feudal lord and
he is a mere page.

141
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,154
We are now standing on
different surfaces.

142
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,700
Say that again! I'll slug the guy
who tramples on friendship...!

143
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,619
Let it go, Naruto.

144
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,455
What're you doing?! Let go of me!

145
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,916
I have to give guys like this
a good thumping!

146
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,376
You are talking about a feudal lord!

147
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,800
It would have been better
had it pierced my throat.

148
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,139
Go.
Yes, my lord.

149
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,609
Jeez, who does he think he is?!

150
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,986
Jeez, a feudal lord.

151
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,072
Please forgive him.

152
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,784
What? You don't have a problem
with being told off like that?!

153
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,453
He wasn't like that in the old days.

154
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,707
His father and little sister
died in succession

155
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,751
and he became cold-hearted.

156
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,463
So that's what it was.

157
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,090
I'm sure the day will come

158
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,968
when he will turn back into
the kind-hearted Lord Sagi.

159
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,178
I don't know about that.

160
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,722
The Shuriken from before.

161
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,475
This is an odd shape.

162
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,852
Hm? Let me have a look.

163
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,687
Oh!

164
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,022
Does it look familiar to you
or something?

165
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,110
Y-Yes. There are no Ninja
in the Land of Birds.

166
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,405
But there are guardsmen
receiving special training.

167
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,491
Is it a weapon those people use?
Yes.

168
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,119
Who commands those guardsmen?

169
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,581
The person who organizes them
is Lord Komei the tactician.

170
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,957
Say what?!

171
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,918
Komei again.

172
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,895
Komei must have originally thought to
mislead the public with the Cursed Warrior

173
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,482
and attempted to create
a rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.

174
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,735
But the relationship between
the two is tight.

175
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,404
And by Moso summoning us here,
he probably sensed that the day

176
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,908
was approaching when the truth
behind the incident would be revealed

177
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,410
and he plotted
to assassinate Lord Sagi.

178
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,665
If we've figured out that much,
let's charge on in...!

179
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,709
Hold your horses, Naruto.

180
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,129
We have to find more hard evidence.

181
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,548
Hey, is that how it is?

182
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,050
Yeah, that's how it is.

183
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,428
Neji, look at that.

184
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,066
No doubt, it's Komei!

185
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,944
To think he'd go out without attendants

186
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,279
even though the Cursed Warrior
might appear.

187
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,906
All right, let's follow him.

188
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,100
This is the temple where
the Cursed Warrior appeared last night.

189
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,643
Something smells fishy.

190
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,170
He's shown up...!

191
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,516
Byakugan.

192
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,605
What's this?!

193
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,064
There's no need to waver anymore!

194
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,984
Hey! Wait.

195
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,947
I've witnessed the true identity
of the ghost!

196
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,742
?Who's there?

197
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,078
Hey hey, Komei!

198
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,124
You're the one responsible
for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?

199
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,209
What?

200
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,556
H-Hold it!

201
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,226
Naruto, get down!

202
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,365
I did it!

203
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,331
Damn it! No good.

204
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,000
This thing's not just a ghost, after all.

205
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:09,636
A tornado?

206
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,983
I can't see the Cursed Warrior!

207
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,657
Byakugan.

208
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,083
A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!

209
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,047
Trigrams Palm Rotation!

210
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,972
What're you letting your mind drift for?!

211
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,684
Sorry... I never thought a ghost could
use Ninjutsu.

212
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,188
It's not a ghost inside the armor.
It's a Shinobi.

213
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,066
And quite a wily one at that.

214
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,070
This is the same shape
as the shuriken from this afternoon.

215
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,660
He's an important witness.
Take him alive.

216
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,954
Leave it to me!

217
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,007
But we can't take him alive

218
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,341
if we don't do something about
that tornado.

219
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,426
Naruto.

220
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,144
I'm counting on you!
Right. I'll try!

221
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,608
Tenten, use as many weapons
as possible and draw his attention.

222
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,234
Roger.

223
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,081
No good. No effect at all.

224
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,125
That's fine. Just keep at it.

225
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,853
Neji...now!

226
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,321
Gentle Fist Technique,
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.

227
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,991
8 Trigrams 2 Palms.

228
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,952
4 Palms.

229
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,869
8 Palms.

230
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,038
16 Palms.

231
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,082
32 Palms.

232
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,252
64 Palms.

233
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,051
All right, we did it!

234
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,053
We'll find out the true identity
for sure this time.

235
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,478
Show us your real face.

236
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,570
What's this?

237
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,751
It's empty again.

238
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,962
This can't be!

239
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,936
Lord Komei, we have seized from
a storeroom in your residence,

240
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,148
one suit of white armor along
with guardsmen Shuriken.

241
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,820
We would like you to report
to the magistrate's office

242
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,364
as a material witness in
the recent Cursed Warrior incident

243
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:02,410
as well as the attempted assassination
of Lord Sagi.

244
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,498
I have no choice.

245
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,222
Thank you very much.

246
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:27,435
With this, Lord Sagi's heart should
settle down somewhat.

247
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,646
Case closed.

248
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,982
Still, they were sure prepared.

249
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,195
Here an hour has barely passed
since contacting Moso.

250
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,279
At that time...

251
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,572
– Huh?
– Huh?

252
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,452
There was a human presence
in tonight's Cursed Warrior.

253
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,037
The presence of someone alive.

254
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,498
A presence?

255
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:53,586
But you said you didn't feel such
a presence in the first Cursed Warrior.

256
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,712
Yeah.

257
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,967
Hey, what does that mean?

258
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,972
In other words, the two Cursed Warrior
are separate beings.

259
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:22,824
So many things happen

260
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:28,538
on this endless road, huh?

261
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:34,168
Although you're strong-willed,

262
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:40,216
your voice wavered on the phone today

263
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,387
What dreams

264
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:51,310
did you chase to get here?

265
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:56,816
Even I have times when

266
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:03,364
I just don't understand, baby

267
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:08,995
When you're sad,

268
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:14,834
I'll be close to you

269
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:21,049
Even on nights when we're apart,

270
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:26,471
I'll be close to you

271
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:32,268
I'll be close to you

272
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,569
How can we go back to the village
when there's all this mystery?

273
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,989
If we're gonna investigate,
this has to be it.

274
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,116
What? Could this black thing be...?

275
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,535
I get it!

276
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:55,249
We use this
to get through the dark...

277
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:59,087
Hey, why did we end up
in a place like this?!

278
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,589
Next: "Too Late for Help"
