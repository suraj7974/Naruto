1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,312
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,775
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,821
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,201
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,789
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,420
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,300
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,428
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,974
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,603
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,273
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,151
In time, we'll realize

13
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,238
that it was everything

14
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,700
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

15
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,287
creating a river of tears

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:24,210
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

17
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,005
and melting away

18
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,892
Hurry!
Right...

19
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,909
We're close!

20
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,786
There are two enemies left...

21
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,665
There are three of us...
It's three against two.

22
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,710
We might be able to do it with
one more contact if we do it well.

23
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,296
All right! All right!
Let's do it!

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,757
No! It's four against two!

25
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,428
Okay, okay! I'm sorry.

26
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,056
Counting Akamaru,
it's four against two!

27
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,561
Let's finish it quickly with
our new technique next!

28
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,943
Say, say. If necessary,
I'll do an awesome Shadow Clone,

29
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,319
so it'll be okay!

30
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,114
That's reassuring...

31
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:40,286
But my strategy comes first. Got it?

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,788
Y-Yeah...

33
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,083
For that purpose,

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,919
we have to catch up
before the sun sets at any cost.

35
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,839
I know. Full throttle!

36
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,561
The sun's starting to set...

37
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,689
Neither Jirobo nor
Kidomaru have come.

38
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,858
It seems they're having
a hard time.

39
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,987
It doesn't matter...
More important is Lord Orochimaru.

40
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,662
We've only completed one-third
of the journey in half a day...

41
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,714
They all have Curse Marks, huh...

42
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,091
No questions asked, huh?

43
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,677
This is gonna be different
than that time before

44
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,012
with your surprise attack...

45
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,768
Too much interference...

46
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,103
Yeah, this is bad...

47
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,148
We don't know whether
we'll make it in time at this rate!

48
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,455
Damn! We still can't catch up...

49
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,374
No, this is good enough.

50
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,794
We'll maintain this distance
and continue the pursuit...

51
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,879
Wh-What do you mean?

52
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,758
I mean, we're delaying
the attack until dawn breaks.

53
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,345
Get real!
We can't afford such leisure!

54
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,807
That's right! Besides, if we're going
to attack anyway,

55
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,185
isn't it more advantageous
to use the darkness and attack?!

56
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,272
For us, the darkness works
to our advantage

57
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,150
only the moment
we launch the attack.

58
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,654
It'd be close to impossible
to grab Sasuke,

59
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,700
get away from them and escape
to a safe location

60
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,159
in just that one moment.

61
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,084
If we couldn't get Sasuke
back in that one moment,

62
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,129
they'd probably just focus
on guarding the coffin.

63
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,217
If that happens, we wouldn't stand
a chance in the darkness.

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,760
On the contrary,

65
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,804
for the part where they wouldn't
have to move needlessly,

66
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,681
suddenly they'd get the advantage.

67
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,060
It'd be a different story
if we had Neji's Byakugan, but...

68
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,522
Hey, come on.

69
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,191
Aren't you forgetting Akamaru's nose
and mine as well??

70
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,321
I was sure to include your senses
of smell in the calculations!

71
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,992
Even so, up ahead they have
the geographical advantage.

72
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,577
Plus...

73
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,500
if I can't use my Jutsu,
it'll be no use.

74
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,797
Even if I seal off their movements
with Shadow Possession Jutsu...

75
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,843
the effect would be reduced to half
if clouds were to cover the moon.

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,556
It's a drag, but there are too many
dangers, and uncertain elements.

77
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,059
But!
Got it!

78
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,477
Naruto?

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,770
You're the leader...

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,981
I'll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!

81
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,317
Right. I'm counting on you!

82
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,032
The Vessel Arrives Too Late

83
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,458
Hey, Tayuya!
Will we really make it in time?

84
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,129
I was just told to deliver
Master Sasuke by tomorrow.

85
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,048
By tomorrow, huh?

86
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,926
I can't say that we have
lots of time to spare,

87
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,761
but I guess we'll make it in time.

88
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,137
I hope so.

89
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,651
Lord Orochimaru...

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,660
Sasuke...

91
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,745
No Sasuke...yet?

92
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,376
He's running out of time...
He can't go on any longer.

93
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,961
Lord Orochimaru...

94
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,131
Several bodies have been
prepared for you!

95
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,135
And...you could even use me,
if necessary...

96
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,890
It has to be Sasuke...

97
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,268
How long do you think I've waited?

98
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,812
It's a matter of urgency!

99
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,981
The Third Hokage's Jutsu...

100
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,233
His curse was stronger
than expected!

101
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,083
Take this! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!

102
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,137
Wh-What's this sensation?

103
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,357
Seal!

104
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,119
My arm...

105
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:12,511
If you don't "reanimate" right now,
you'll lose everything!

106
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,179
Is that what you want?!

107
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,473
Lose everything...

108
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,899
I've selected and prepared
proficient bodies for you.

109
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,193
Please leave it to me! Also...

110
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,697
I'll handle the recovery
of Sasuke as well.

111
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,200
Shall I use Kimimaro?

112
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,132
Curse you ...

113
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,092
Third Hokage!

114
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,823
Release!

115
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,299
Listen well, everyone!

116
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,849
I shall release you from this prison...

117
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,482
However, it'll only
be one of you!

118
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,078
Now all that's left is to
wake up Kimimaro, huh?

119
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,321
Just as I thought...

120
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,533
I wasn't summoned this time, either.

121
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,036
Dr. Kabuto, I...

122
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,789
Take care of your body.

123
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,583
Your role is now finished.

124
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,380
It's not Sound Ninja Five now,
Kimimaro...

125
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,848
I...still haven't...

126
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,852
Your replacement has
already been found.

127
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,984
He possesses power equal
to your "Earth" Curse Mark.

128
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,611
He has been given
the "Heaven" Curse Mark.

129
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,698
Additionally, he even
has the Kekkei Genkai.

130
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,126
Wonder who's stronger...

131
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,471
What's the matter?
Don't get too excited.

132
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,443
Dr. Kabuto...

133
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:04,367
M-My life, how much do I have left?

134
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,916
You shouldn't talk anymore...

135
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:17,255
P-People... People are born
with some kind of meaning...

136
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,051
Since people are born,

137
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,054
there must be some kind
of important calling.

138
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,307
Recently I've started thinking so...

139
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,782
That the meaning for being born...

140
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,954
For people, finding the meaning is...

141
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,792
the only freedom God has given.

142
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,549
I understand what you want to say.

143
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,302
Indeed, Lord Orochimaru
is now suffering.

144
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,223
It's an unprecedented
difficult situation,

145
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,767
but I'll mince no words.

146
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,270
What can you do now?

147
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,690
You've now lost your value
as a "vessel."

148
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,945
A new vessel is heading this way.

149
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,905
Well...

150
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,825
At this point in time,
it's too late, but...

151
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,088
Okay! You said you were going
to let one person out of here.

152
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,340
You're going to keep
your promise.

153
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,135
What're you doing?
Open the door now!

154
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,824
What? There was another one?

155
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,992
Hurry up and...

156
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,943
No...I...
I'll be eaten here, right now...

157
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,327
I'll let you out of here...

158
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,456
And I shall grant you
just one wish.

159
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,722
My clan that was captured
for your experiments.

160
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,265
Please release them.

161
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,562
Sure. Consider it done.

162
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,274
You don't have to worry.

163
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:28,988
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.

164
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,492
It's not like you'll lose everything.

165
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,958
Now then, your flesh is mine...

166
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,592
With this, Lord Orochimaru's body
will, once again

167
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,387
be unable to reanimate
for several years.

168
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,348
However, there is the next time.

169
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,186
I-Indeed...

170
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,816
my body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.

171
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,280
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything...

172
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,241
to find my own calling.

173
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,703
I've finally understood that...

174
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,125
Even if it's not me,

175
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,672
I'll bring in the new "vessel"
even if it costs me my life.

176
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,218
That's my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru...

177
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:38,641
That's the only redemption
for me for being worthless...

178
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,906
Hold on a minute!

179
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,366
Are we almost there?

180
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,036
No... It should still take a while.

181
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,412
More importantly...

182
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,924
What were those idiots
Jirobo and Kidomaru doing?!

183
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,135
We caught up!

184
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,684
All right! I'll take care of
this nice and quick!

185
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,144
R-Right away?!

186
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,860
Eat this!

187
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,575
Multiple Fists Barrage!

188
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,083
Chakra in his palm...?!

189
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,045
Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?

190
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,005
Rasengan!

191
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,178
N-No way... His hands now...?!

192
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,640
There's no point if
I catch you before you do it!

193
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,810
Now, Kiba!
Tunneling Fang!

194
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,565
This was also a Shadow Clone?!

195
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,114
Luring Sakon into alignment with me...

196
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,991
and aiming at me from the start?!

197
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,410
You think you succeeded
just with that?!

198
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,998
Damn!

199
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
I've been nailed.

200
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,627
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

201
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,212
A diversion...

202
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,048
He's coming!

203
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,969
Tayuya! What're you doing
idling away?!

204
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,470
N-No!

205
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,391
Why do you move forward?!

206
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,351
I can't dodge!

207
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,274
Here you go!

208
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,861
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

209
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,322
Shikamaru! Let's get out of here!

210
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,033
Yeah!

211
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,576
Punks...!

212
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,287
You scums... Messing around with us.

213
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,336
They were full of openings
just as I thought.

214
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,714
Having too much ability individually
is also a problem...

215
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,758
It went well.

216
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,093
Yeah, it went just as calculated!

217
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:24,182
Just in terms of teamwork,
ours was way better than theirs.

218
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,820
I won't let you get away!

219
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,147
For the first time, I spoke to you

220
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,442
And you smiled

221
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,695
For the first time, I was able to speak

222
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

223
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:27,286
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

224
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,709
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

225
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:38,631
My clumsy attempts with words

226
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:44,303
You listened without turning away

227
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:50,685
No wonder I get carried away by you

228
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:55,481
But you don't feel anything for me,

229
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,817
do you?

230
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,571
I feel so sad
But...

231
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,948
For the first time, I spoke to you

232
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,326
And you smiled

233
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,620
For the first time, I was able to speak

234
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,957
In my own words

235
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,251
For the first time, I spoke to you

236
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,588
And you smiled

237
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,882
For the first time, I was able to speak

238
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,135
In my own words

239
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:28,848
For the first time, I spoke to you

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,861
Damn it! To come this far
and have another one appear!

241
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,364
On top of that, there's something out
of ordinary about this guy.

242
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,576
What's this bloodcurdling feeling
on my back?

243
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,830
Indeed, we are even on numbers,
two against two.

244
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,248
But this...

245
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:58,711
I'm sorry, Naruto.
He's my miscalculation.

246
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,715

A New Enemy Appears!"
