1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:38,873
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,045
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,891
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,315
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,077
into your hands

12
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:22,708
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,796
Stop!

15
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,299
D-Don't push my father around!

16
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,260
You idiot, Fuki. Get out of here!

17
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:20,182
What're you hesitating for?
Take care of him quickly.

18
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,142
That's your job, right?

19
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,563
Get out of my way.

20
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,647
Fuki!

21
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,775
You've got something nice there.

22
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,694
I'll take that.

23
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,113
Please spare my daughter!

24
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,322
Like I care!

25
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,619
Father...

26
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,247
Father! Father!

27
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,878
Stop it!

28
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,632
Y-You jerk.

29
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,860
Here.

30
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,237
It's okay.

31
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,381
Look out!

32
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,317
Just a little more...
Just a little more, believe it.

33
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,446
Rare menma pickled bamboo shoots?

34
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:01,951
Right. But only if I can get my hands
on it when it's in rare bamboo state.

35
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:06,163
It seems the rare bamboo only grows
on some ungodly cliff...

36
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,832
Then I'll get it, no matter what.

37
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,002
And then I'll eat some Ichiraku ramen
with the rare pickled bamboo shoots on top...

38
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,755
No matter what, believe it!

39
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,050
Rare pickled bamboo shoots.

40
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,385
I did it!

41
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,266
I'm saved.

42
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,351
Huh?

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,521
What is that?

44
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,858
It's a person!

45
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:45,536
Vanished Memories

46
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,004
To think there'd be thunder
even though it's not raining...

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,880
It's kind of eerie.

48
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,847
You shouldn't shout like that...

49
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,473
This is a hospital.

50
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,600
You made me shout.

51
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,769
Huh? That white coat.

52
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,896
Could it be that you're helping out
the Medical Team, Sakura?

53
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,191
Isn't it lovely? I finally got the white coat.

54
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,696
I see. It's great that you were here
just at the right time.

55
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,365
I've got someone I'd like you
to take a look at.

56
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,825
Someone you want me
to take a look at?

57
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,661
It's him.

58
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,664
Wh-What? Could that be Dozaemon...?

59
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,167
His name's Dozaemon, huh...?

60
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,252
I didn't think he was
your acquaintance Sakura.

61
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,130
No. Dozaemon is a drowned body...

62
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,631
Oh, never mind...

63
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,759
I thought I knew him, but I was mistaken.

64
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,762
I see. Then I leave him to you.

65
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,514
Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.

66
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,725
So people outside of the village
can't be admitted.

67
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,602
Come on, just do this for me.

68
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,937
I've got other business to attend to.
So I leave the rest to you.

69
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,941
Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!

70
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,614
This is indeed the rare bamboo
I've heard about.

71
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,701
Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!

72
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,161
What're you talking about?

73
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,913
It takes three or four weeks to make

74
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,165
the pickled bamboo shoots
out of the rare bamboo.

75
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,708
What?!

76
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,545
First, I boil this
and then ferment it slowly.

77
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,799
What, I can't eat it right away?!

78
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,843
You need a degree of determination
to eat delicious things.

79
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,012
Naruto, so this is where you were.

80
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,806
Hey, what's up with you?

81
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,432
What's up, nothing, you jerk...

82
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,392
Oww!

83
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,186
So you force a strange patient on me

84
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,355
and intend to eat ramen
by yourself at your leisure?

85
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,981
Ouch. That hurts.

86
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,369
Back to the Past Jutsu!

87
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,083
Oh, what's he doing there?

88
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,878
He's probing into his memory
from his subconscious.

89
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,965
That reverse hypnosis thing, huh?

90
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,216
Right.

91
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,138
Have you remembered anything?

92
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,433
I see.

93
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,019
It seems he's lost his memory.

94
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,688
Lost his memory?

95
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,608
Let's call it a day.
We'll do more tomorrow.

96
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,405
It seems he doesn't remember anything.

97
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,240
Not his name or address...

98
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,993
If none the doctor's Jutsu don't work,
then this is the real deal.

99
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,746
Then, doesn't he have something
we could use to identify him?

100
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,666
Nope... This is all he had.

101
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,255
What's this?

102
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,966
It's a dove flute, also called an ocarina.

103
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,634
Ocarina?

104
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,303
It's broken, though.

105
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,430
Oh, it looks like this will stick.

106
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,601
Not having memory could also
be a temporary state of shock...

107
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,978
Anyway, you sign this.

108
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,229
What's this?

109
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,106
A letter of undertaking.

110
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,359
I told you earlier,
but this is a Leaf hospital.

111
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,653
Outsiders aren't allowed.

112
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,197
If something were to happen,

113
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,282
you will take responsibility
for everything, Naruto.

114
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,491
What?!

115
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,576
You got a problem?

116
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,786
Fine, okay.

117
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,916
I sure picked up something troublesome.

118
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,575
What's going on?!

119
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,536
That's in the direction of the hospital!

120
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:03,460
Everyone, it'll be okay.
Please evacuate calmly.

121
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,196
Help me!

122
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,662
Forgive me... Forgive me.

123
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,624
Is there anyone left?

124
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,168
Anyone here?

125
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,719
Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?

126
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,387
I'm checking right now.

127
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey, Sakura!

128
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,015
Naruto.

129
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,558
Everything okay?

130
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,767
Somehow.

131
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,269
Hey, where is that guy?

132
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,395
What?

133
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,479
Come to think of it...

134
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,441
He's not here.

135
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:12,904
Please help! My baby is...
My baby is still inside!

136
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,906
What did you say?!

137
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,785
No way. It doesn't look like
we can get in with these flames...

138
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,871
What're you doing?!
Hurry up and put out the fire!

139
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,650
I'll go in!

140
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,154
That's reckless. The baby is in
the deepest part of the hospital.

141
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,035
What?

142
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,496
It's the sound of a flute.

143
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,664
It's him!

144
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,084
He's getting closer.

145
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,461
Here he comes!

146
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,214
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

147
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,677
– This way!
– To the right.

148
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,971
He did it! The baby is with him, too!

149
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,056
All right!

150
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,516
My boy!

151
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,518
That was a close shave.

152
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,144
Thank goodness!

153
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,106
Thank you very much...Thank you!

154
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,273
Sure.

155
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,944
Thank you so much.

156
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,701
An outsider with amnesia, huh?

157
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,371
Good grief. What a dilemma.

158
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,083
It'd be okay just to let
that one guy stay, right?

159
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,668
We can't do that.

160
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
For the safety of the village,

161
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,047
we must not overlook even
the slightest thing.

162
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,173
But, we figured out that

163
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:59,010
he's not a bad guy
after that incident, right?

164
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,721
Unfortunately, we must not let someone
whose identity we don't know

165
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,473
stay in the village.

166
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,225
Then, if he were to do something,

167
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,352
I'll take the responsibility
and figure something out.

168
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:11,648
Sakura, how's he doing?
Has he remembered anything?

169
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
No, nothing yet.

170
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,236
I see.

171
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,738
I'm begging you.
I'll let you guys have some of

172
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,825
the rare pickled bamboo
shoot ramen too, Grandma.

173
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,161
Rare...pickled bamboo shoots?

174
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,831
Yeah. I went to pick some on
the way back from a mission

175
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,250
and then found him...!

176
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,752
That's news to me.

177
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,048
So you were loitering around like
that on your way back from a mission?

178
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,425
Ouch. Oww.

179
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:43,263
Naruto, so you're serious about
looking after that boy, huh?

180
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,516
Yeah, it's true.

181
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,978
All right, then I'll let that boy
remain in the village.

182
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,605
Lady Tsunade!

183
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,233
I can't run out the person
who saved a child from this village.

184
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:59,196
Excellent, Grandma.
Now you're talking!

185
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm Naruto Uzumaki...
Nice to know you.

186
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,121
I-I'm...

187
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:12,250
Oh, that's right.
Your memory hasn't come back yet.

188
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,377
Then, hmmm.

189
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,631
Menma, make it Menma.

190
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,382
Menma?

191
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,761
Yeah. I'd gone to pick some
and then I found you, so...

192
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,471
Menma...

193
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,475
Okay, got it. My name's Menma.

194
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,852
It's settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.

195
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,896
Good to meet you, Naruto.

196
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,606
Here you go.

197
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,234
Wow, it looks delicious.

198
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,320
The ramen here is the best
in the world, believe it.

199
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,157
Let's eat.

200
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,161
Tasty.

201
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:55,126
But this isn't the finished product.
Don't you notice something lacking?

202
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,211
Huh?

203
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,088
Oh.

204
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,590
Come to think of it, there isn't
any menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.

205
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,677
Right. Until the rare pickled
bamboo shoots are ready,

206
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,346
they're sealed from your ramen.

207
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,099
Hey, old man, you'll be
sure to make it, right?

208
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,517
Absolutely.

209
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,062
I can't wait. Say, Menma.

210
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,940
Let's definitely come here together
to have some at that time.

211
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,024
Right.

212
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,404
Okay, come on in.

213
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,780
Excuse me for barging in.

214
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,658
As of today, this is your home.

215
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,869
It's a dirty place,
but make yourself comfortable.

216
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,954
Whoa.

217
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,915
It really is dirty.

218
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,127
Don't get so hung up on the details.

219
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,421
Y-You're right.

220
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,840
More importantly, let's get to sleep and

221
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,552
starting tomorrow we'll come up with
a way to get your memory back.

222
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,886
Right.

223
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,852
I can't eat anymore...

224
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,457
Man, I slept well!

225
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,167
Morning, Naruto.

226
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,961
Menma?

227
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,631
Whoa.

228
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,175
Everything's been cleaned up nicely!

229
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,386
Did you do this?

230
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,306
Yeah. I couldn't sleep and
had time to kill.

231
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,558
Thanks for that...

232
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,270
Hey, Menma! What're you doing?!

233
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,232
What do you mean?
I'm hanging up the laundry.

234
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,486
Don't wash someone else's underwear!

235
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll do that myself,
so don't worry about it!

236
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,365
Really?

237
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,456
Now then...
How should we get your memory back?

238
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,459
Oh, I know!

239
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,127
Come with me, Menma.

240
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,260
This is a specialty from the Land of Wind,
Sand Dumplings.

241
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:13,014
This fine soy powder is used to
resemble sand and they taste really good.

242
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,099
Yeah?

243
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,268
And this one is a specialty from
the Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.

244
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,646
The crunchy texture is irresistible.

245
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,772
Uh-huh.

246
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,693
And this is a specialty from
the Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.

247
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,112
So? Have you remembered anything?

248
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,322
No... Nothing at all.

249
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,325
Oh, I thought you might
remember something

250
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,869
if they had a specialty
from your home.

251
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,204
Sorry.

252
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,164
No need to apologize.

253
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,711
Naruto, forget about my memory.

254
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,337
What?

255
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,967
You see, we don't know how
or when my memory will come back.

256
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,971
More importantly,
you've got your own work, right?

257
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,848
Well, you've got a point.

258
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,767
I've got to finish cleaning
the Great Stone Faces by today...

259
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,811
Then let's do that.

260
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,857
But before that, wait just a minute.

261
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,941
Huh?

262
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,151
Hey, Menma.

263
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,903
Ma'am...

264
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,448
I'll carry your things
to your house.

265
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, thank you.

266
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,336
Thank you very much.

267
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,046
No problem.

268
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,342
At any rate, you've sure got
a lot of weeds growing in your yard.

269
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,054
My lower back has been
bothering me lately...

270
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,849
The grass grows as much as it wants.

271
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,018
Then I'll do it.

272
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,561
Oh, my.

273
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,273
I-I will, too!

274
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,317
Thanks so much!

275
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,654
Phew... Finally done!

276
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,739
Naruto.

277
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,199
What is it?

278
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,408
They want help too!

279
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,576
Huh?

280
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,038
It seems this area here
is all homes of the elderly.

281
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,998
Thanks.

282
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,500
I leave it to you.

283
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,960
F-For real?

284
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,089
What's this?

285
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,676
Actually, thank-you gifts have
been sent to Naruto and that boy

286
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,637
from all over the village.

287
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,264
What're those two doing?

288
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,229
But really, you're sure an odd guy.

289
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,688
Am I?

290
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,732
You've got a strong
sense of righteousness,

291
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,859
I mean,
you're the embodiment of kindness.

292
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,153
It's not something easily done.

293
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,031
I just want to live right.

294
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,117
I don't want to have any more regrets.

295
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,538
Hm? Menma,
have you remembered something?

296
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,581
Huh? No, not really.

297
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,999
I see.

298
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,127
What?! Is it bird poop?

299
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,548
It's blood!

300
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,638
Give me a hand, Menma!

301
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,764
Right!

302
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,561
What's the matter?!

303
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,355
Someone...in this village...

304
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:10,817
Let's get out of here!

305
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,529
Menma, I leave this guy to you.

306
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,780
Got it.

307
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,332
Damn it!

308
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,214
Damn you. Come on out!

309
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,263
Damn it! Where's he hiding?

310
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,849
Naruto...

311
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,697
Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!

312
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,122
Huh? What's this...?

313
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,626
Awesome power's starting to
well up in my whole body.

314
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,794
All right.

315
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,548
Awesome!

316
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,551
Power's flowing over me!

317
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,310
I see you.

318
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,688
Damn it.

319
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,405
I did it.

320
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,076
It's a Substitution!

321
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,079
Damn it. He got away, huh...?

322
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,583
You okay, Naruto?

323
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,461
Menma...

324
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,046
That flute just now...

325
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,759
Who in the world are you?

326
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,061
The Key to the rusted heart's door

327
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:16,150
Will always be smiling right near by

328
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,244
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

329
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,999
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

330
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,712
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

331
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,508
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

332
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:45,304
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

333
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:49,976
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

334
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:54,188
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

335
00:21:54,272 --> 00:22:01,112
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

336
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:05,825
The wind is probably testing our hearts

337
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,455
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

338
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:15,293
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

339
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,131
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

340
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

341
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,308
Will always be smiling right near by

342
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,192
As I thought, he's no ordinary man.

343
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,360
He won't be an easy opponent to fight.

344
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,570
Wait a minute.

345
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,197
You are talking about Menma
like his our enemy or something.

346
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,865
There is that possibility, you know.

347
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,867
He could be with the intruder
from the other day.

348
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,285
What are you talking about?

349
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,371
Weren't you two gonna help us
seek Menma's memory together?

350
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,957
Our mission is to find out
the guy's identity

351
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,334
and to catch the intruder.

352
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,879
Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

353
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,465
Next time: "Bringing Back Reality"
