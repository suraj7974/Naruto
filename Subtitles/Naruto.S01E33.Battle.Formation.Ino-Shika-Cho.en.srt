1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,426
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,346
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,475
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,228
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,357
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:33,701
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:46,881
It will come, closer
Now

11
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,227
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

12
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,604
Our feet are tied

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,483
But we still keep going farther

14
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:10,946
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

15
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,615
If you're not the one

16
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,414
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,567
Where is...this place...?

19
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:58,994
Who is it?

20
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,293
Me...
from long ago?

21
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,382
Father and mother didn't need to die!

22
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,349
Everyone was killed.

23
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,520
I had no power so...

24
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,482
the clan vanished.

25
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,458
Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!

26
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,345
Ino... Why?

27
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,309
I can't let you upstage me
in front of Sasuke!

28
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,728
Squirming again...

29
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,399
The Leaf Village worms wandered in.

30
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,028
What are the two of you thinking?!

31
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,988
They're bad news!

32
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,157
It's a pain, but it can't be helped!

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,952
Ino steps out and
we men should run?

34
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,123
Sorry to get you involved.

35
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,292
But anyway we're
a Three-Man Squad, after all.

36
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,419
We're all in this together, aren't we?

37
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,755
Well, we'll see.

38
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,966
No! I don't want to die yet!

39
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,384
Let go of my scarf!

40
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,929
You're annoying! Quit wiggling!

41
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:45,184
It's okay for you to drop out, fatso.

42
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,605
What did that guy just say?

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,150
I...didn't quite catch it.

44
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,401
Huh?!

45
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,071
That word is taboo to Choji.

46
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,907
Try saying it again...

47
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,453
I said if you have a problem,
pull out, fatso.

48
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,957
Fatso...fatso...fatso...fatso...fatso

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,172
I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned!
Blast it!

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,971
Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!

51
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,182
W-Wow...

52
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,394
All right! You understand this, right?!

53
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,271
This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,067
Lucky! He's lost it!

55
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,153
No way, this looks like it's going
to be a pain in the butt.

56
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,864
That's my line.

57
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,160
I was told to get Sasuke
by the end of the test...

58
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,957
Sasuke...
Sakura...

59
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,920
The two behind...
take care of them.

60
00:04:58,674 --> 00:04:59,675
Okay!

61
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,012
Well then, Team Ino,
let's go full throttle!

62
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,138
Right!

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,348
Formation Ino!

64
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,017
– Shika!
– Cho!

65
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,979
I'm counting on you, Choji

66
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,105
Okay!

67
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,440
Expansion Jutsu!

68
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,901
Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!

69
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,826
Human Boulder!

70
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,955
What is this Jutsu?

71
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,082
Isn't it just a fat guy rolling?

72
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,793
Slicing Sound Wave!

73
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,890
You!

74
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,149
He jumped?!

75
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,402
The air pressure of
Slicing Sound Wave

76
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,404
is less than effective
against that rotation.

77
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,450
Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,
if I'm touched by something like that

78
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,702
the bones in my arms will be crushed!

79
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,959
Think I'll let you?!

80
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,420
You're the most annoying so...

81
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,880
Ninja Art!

82
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,590
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

83
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,179
My body!

84
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,305
Huh?!

85
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,860
Dosu?!
What are you doing at a time like this?!

86
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,493
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?

87
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,163
Ino, next it's just the ladies.

88
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:57,209
Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.

89
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,293
Gotcha!

90
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,545
Huh?

91
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,131
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

92
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,851
Shoot!

93
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,270
Kin!

94
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,691
What happened?

95
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,489
This...is the end of it.

96
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,616
You guys!

97
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,036
If you make one move,
this girl named Kin is dead meat!

98
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,080
If you don't want this
to end right here,

99
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,416
leave your scroll and walk away!

100
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,336
Once you've gone far enough that
I can't feel your Chakras,

101
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,589
I'll release this girl!

102
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,884
These guys...
What are they grinning about?

103
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,511
– Choji!
– Yeah!

104
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,513
This isn't good! They won't...!

105
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,854
Ino!

106
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,357
Uggghh. I'm dizzy.

107
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,198
W-What kind of person...
hurts their own comrades?

108
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,285
Careless.

109
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:20,292
Our goal is not the scrolls or
to pass this test playing by the rules.

110
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,502
What?

111
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,463
It's Sasuke.

112
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:33,889
Humph...

113
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,350
My Jutsu...

114
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,019
So your much precious
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu

115
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,313
is limited to 5 minutes?

116
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,816
It's not Shadow Paralysis.
It's Shadow Possession Jutsu.

117
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,819
In addition, it seems that
this girl's Jutsu...

118
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:53,283
seems to be a Jutsu to
take over the other's body.

119
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,661
From the looks of the blood
she's spitting up,

120
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,248
if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...

121
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,251
Are you going to do in...
your teammate?

122
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,254
If I need to...

123
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,177
This is no good.

124
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,637
Shoot...

125
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:19,017
That's too bad...
you're just a step away.

126
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,061
You're too easy-going.

127
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,106
Hmph, I don't like this at all.

128
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,359
You minor Sound Ninjas...

129
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,321
Bullying the second-rate guys and
putting on airs like a winner.

130
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,614
What?!

131
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,162
They're Lee's teammates...

132
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,750
Lee!

133
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,085
You goofed.

134
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:50,090
Hah! Coming out of nowhere
like cockroaches...

135
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,469
That kid with the bob lying over there
is on our team, but...

136
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,306
But you messed with him, didn't you?!.

137
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,025
What's with his eyes?

138
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,862
It's like they see through everything...

139
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,824
If you're gonna continue,
I'll fight with full strength!

140
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,452
Huh?

141
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,245
What 's wrong? Neji...

142
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,414
This Chakra...

143
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,420
If you don't like me,
don't play cool, come down here.

144
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,674
No. Evidently, there's no need for that.

145
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,989
After all...

146
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,408
without power...

147
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,203
I can't do anything!

148
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:08,168
Because I had no power...
Everyone was killed!

149
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,758
No...
You let them be killed.

150
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,596
You only...watched.

151
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,641
If only I had power...

152
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,936
If only I had power...

153
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,908
Sasuke! You're awake...
Huh?!

154
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,037
Huh?

155
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,293
That's...

156
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,920
Sasuke?

157
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,062
Sakura...

158
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,876
Sakura...

159
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,879
Who did this to you?

160
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,466
Who is it?

161
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,178
The Curse Marks run
around his entire body?!

162
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,182
Sasuke...
That body...?

163
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,155
Don't worry.

164
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,117
On the contrary,
strength is rapidly flowing in...

165
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,578
Right now I feel good.

166
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,498
That guy gave this to me.

167
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,665
Huh?

168
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,626
At last I understand...

169
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,670
I'm an Avenger...

170
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,299
On my road, I must put power
into my hands...

171
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,969
even if it means abandoning
myself to the devil.

172
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,644
So...I see...

173
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,731
So the mark on the neck
that this girl called Sakura spoke of

174
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,983
is this Curse Mark.

175
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,693
But...

176
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,029
I didn't think he could stand up...

177
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,823
Sakura, tell me...

178
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,660
Who harmed you...?

179
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,620
Me!

180
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,960
Huh?

181
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,044
Ino!

182
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,672
If you stay like that
you're gonna get involved!

183
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,257
Come back to this body!

184
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,842
Choji, you too,
come over here and hide.

185
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,302
Y-Yeah.

186
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,971
Uh-oh.

187
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,889
Release!

188
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,352
Okay, she's back!

189
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,770
Shikamaru!

190
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,064
What's going to happen now?

191
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,691
How should I know?

192
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,831
Wha...?!

193
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,542
W-What's this...?

194
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,385
No matter...

195
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,096
how you look at it...

196
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,849
his Chakras are...

197
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,101
too big!

198
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,188
Dosu, this half-dead bastard
is nothing to be scared of!

199
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,150
Stop, Zaku! Don't you understand?!

200
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,111
I'll take care of all of them...

201
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,821
in one fell swoop!

202
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,033
Super Sonic Slicing Wave!

203
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,218
Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.

204
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,678
– Who did?
– Huh?!

205
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,142
Zaku!

206
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,230
He's fast!

207
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,776
Moreover, he took in those two,
and in the blink of an eye.

208
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,323
Fire Style!
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

209
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,826
Don't push your luck!
I'll blow them off!

210
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,996
What?!

211
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,748
Shuriken's in the fire?!

212
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,919
Zaku, below you!

213
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,890
The quality of the Chakra
is completely different...

214
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,935
Is that really Sasuke?

215
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,979
What happened?
What in the world...?

216
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,610
It seems like you're
proud of your arms...

217
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,903
You!

218
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,866
S-Stop it!

219
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,832
Sasuke will definitely come for me.

220
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,732
You're the only one left.

221
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,945
You...
make it a little more fun for me.

222
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,788
This isn't...

223
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,588
This isn't...

224
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,845
This is not like...

225
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,181
Sasuke!

226
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,940
S-Stop!!

227
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,987
Stop it.

228
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,624
Please...

229
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,253
Stop.

230
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,691
The Curse Mark is withdrawing...

231
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,944
We're saved for now.

232
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,946
Sasuke!

233
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,411
You're strong.

234
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:48,711
Sasuke... We can't defeat you
the way you are now.

235
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,215
This is our fee for settling this...

236
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,843
Please let us withdraw from here.

237
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,010
Huh?

238
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:07,397
It seems selfish, but we now have
something we need to confirm, too.

239
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,318
That being said,
let's make a promise.

240
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:16,406
If there's another opportunity to
battle with you in this test,

241
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,325
we won't run or hide.

242
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,166
Wait!

243
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,962
Who in the world is Orochimaru?

244
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,006
What did he do to Sasuke?!

245
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,674
Why Sasuke?!

246
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't know...

247
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,640
We were just given orders to
make the hit on Sasuke.

248
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,272
Though you ordered us to
assassinate Sasuke,

249
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,191
you got to him first.

250
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:57,864
Moreover, you didn't kill him,
and left that Curse Mark instead.

251
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,074
I don't know what you're thinking...

252
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,838
Hey! Are you okay?!

253
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,382
It's a pain, but Ino,
I'll leave Lee to you.

254
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,508
Got it.

255
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,179
That Chakra...
It's abnormal.

256
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,558
The Uchiha clan...
this good, huh?

257
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,938
Sakura's in danger!

258
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,942
It's okay...
I'll protect Sakura.

259
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,653
Well, what should we do
with this guy?

260
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,779
Kick him awake?

261
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,948
Can I do it?

262
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,245
What am I...?

263
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,876
Sasuke...

264
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,811
Hey, can you hear it?

265
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,772
The clear,

266
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:18,069
blue sky goes on and on

267
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,990
The ocean

268
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:27,745
spans limitlessly

269
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,873
Please keep that smile

270
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:36,087
on your face forever

271
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:42,552
Or else I'll cry

272
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,848
You won't have to search around you

273
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,727
It's all ok now.

274
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,149
Everyone is inside

275
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,569
this hand

276
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:04,657
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

277
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,245
When you forget what happiness is

278
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,249
Just sing.

279
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,546
Light is born, and darkness was born

280
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,840
The two are one

281
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:27,513
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

282
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:32,560
Hey, can you hear it?

283
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,067
Hey, what's up Akamaru?

284
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,319
Wait a minute, Naruto,
he's acting strange.

285
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,780
What, are you hungry?

286
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,574
Doesn't seem like it.
How about a walk?

287
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,619
I know. You're looking for
an electric pole, aren't you?

288
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,790
He bit me!

289
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:58,211
Next pisode: "Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara's Cruel Strength!"

290
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,589
What in the world do
you want, anyway?
