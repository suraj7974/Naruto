1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,091
Hey boys,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,345
listen up!

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,559
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,938
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
You're not old enough

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,206
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,879
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,965
All the kids said

11
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,706
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,754
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,387
Plea from a Friend

22
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,822
That's Naruto?

23
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,866
What is this intimidating power?

24
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,037
And what was that
red Chakra earlier on?

25
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,998
Is this guy a monster?

26
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,712
What the heck are you?!

27
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,382
Your friend!

28
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,176
That's why I'm telling you

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,971
I'm not gonna let the likes
of Orochimaru get you!

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,932
I'm telling you that I'll stop you...

31
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,768
even if it means breaking
every bone in your arm and legs!

32
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,817
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!

33
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,489
Come on! Wake up, already!

34
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,745
If you don't come to your senses,
I'll have to break your bones

35
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,415
so that you can't move
and I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!

36
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,217
Shut up...

37
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,639
What the heck do you,

38
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,183
who has neither parents nor brothers,
think you understand?

39
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,229
What makes you think that you,
who's been all alone from the start,

40
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,898
can understand anything about me?!

41
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,154
It's because I have the ties
that I feel this agony.

42
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,366
How could you possibly understand...

43
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,785
what it feels like to lose all that!

44
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,190
It's true that I can't understand...

45
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,526
how it feels to really
have parents or brothers...

46
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,945
However...

47
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,781
It's my treat today...
Eat your fill!

48
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,825
Yippee!

49
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:29,663
When I'm with Iruka Sensei,
I imagine...

50
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,123
-Dig in!
-Dig in!

51
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,461
Ninja, first of all, need to
warm their inner man.

52
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,841
Hey! Hey! Don't get too carried away
and overeat!

53
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,805
If this is...
what it feels like to have a dad.

54
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,268
When I'm with you...

55
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,021
Idiot, idiot, idiot...

56
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,315
What was that, you loser?!

57
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,694
I'm not gonna lose to you,
no matter what!

58
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,321
Go ahead and say
whatever you want.

59
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,782
How about this?

60
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,784
Better not start feeling
too comfortable.

61
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,955
I wonder...if having a brother
feels something like that.

62
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,668
Why is it, Naruto...?

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,672
Why is it that you go to
this extent for me...?

64
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:24,218
For me it's a tie that
I've finally been able to have!

65
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:49,076
That's why I'm gonna stop you.

66
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:03,257
It's too late, Naruto...
It's already too late.

67
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,719
I can't go back anymore.

68
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,527
Come, Naruto!

69
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,240
In that case,
I just have to cut that tie.

70
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,665
Cut, huh?

71
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,172
Then why wear that headband now?

72
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,634
I'll acknowledge you...
You're strong.

73
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,803
And the reason for that is

74
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,140
you're someone who knows
the pain of solitude as I do.

75
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,060
And that pain makes people stronger.

76
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,315
And for that very reason,
by cutting that tie,

77
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,067
I will be able to obtain
even greater strength.

78
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,655
I will fight you now on equal terms.
However...

79
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:14,328
You won't even be able to
inflict a scratch on my forehead.

80
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,331
That's something that
won't change in the least.

81
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,588
It seems that whatever I say
won't have any effect anymore, huh?

82
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,549
Sasuke!

83
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,219
I'm done with talking...

84
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,263
From here on, it's only fighting.

85
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,224
Come!

86
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm able to see...

87
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,925
I'm now able to see
this guy's movements...

88
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,885
which I wasn't able to see before.

89
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,931
I'm able to see them!

90
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,528
Sasuke's moving completely
different from a few moments ago.

91
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,575
But I couldn't care less!

92
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,788
In any case, I can't afford to lose!

93
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,248
Damn it!

94
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,587
It must be the influence of my body
getting used to the state of Curse Mark.

95
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,507
When he moves...

96
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,468
by the subtle movements in
the way he exerts his strength...

97
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,973
I can vividly see
an image of his next move.

98
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,359
With my level of "eyes,"

99
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,029
I don't need to use unnecessary Chakra
and can instead preserve it.

100
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,408
The Curse Mark takes
too much Chakra.

101
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,995
If I can see this much...

102
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,918
I can time my attacks to the images of
Naruto's movements as I foresee them.

103
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,479
This is no good...

104
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,066
He's totally reading my movements.

105
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,320
Damn it!

106
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,085
Oh, there you are.

107
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,670
There's no mistake it's this way, right?

108
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,547
Right.

109
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,719
We better hurry.
I have a bad premonition.

110
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,277
Sasuke!

111
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,122
Fire Style:
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

112
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,091
Sa-su-ke...

113
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,804
It's too late, Naruto.

114
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,310
It's too late now! Naruto!

115
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,549
You're weak, aren't you, kid?

116
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:54,185
You better be grateful to me...

117
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,564
and to the Fourth Hokage

118
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,319
who contained me within
the likes of you!

119
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,850
What's going on?

120
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,720
What was that just now?

121
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,305
Even if I'm able to read
Naruto's movements completely...

122
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,100
his Chakra makes
a separate move of its own.

123
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,272
It seems like the Chakra itself is moving
in accordance with its own will...

124
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,443
Even with my "eyes"
I'm unable to read it completely.

125
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,114
That red Chakra...
that's not an ordinary Chakra!

126
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,119
Your target is Naruto, after all.

127
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,039
To abduct Naruto
is the No.1 priority

128
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:24,127
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!

129
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,337
I see...

130
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,841
It appears that you have
some kind of special power.

131
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,761
Now I understand!

132
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,733
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!

133
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,545
That Chakra is protecting him?!

134
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,509
Calm down.

135
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,429
I won't be caught as long as
I fight from distance.

136
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,573
Damn it... This is incredible!

137
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,534
All I can do is dodge...

138
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,482
Please let me get there in time.

139
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,459
Damn it, gimme a break...

140
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,255
If I get tainted by this power ...

141
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,718
I don't even know what
will happen to me in the end...

142
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,765
But, it can't be helped,
can it, Naruto?

143
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,906
It is certainly true
that you were special...

144
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,201
However...

145
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,497
I am even more special than you.

146
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,923
Sasuke!

147
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:15,316
When I recalled the parts one by one,

148
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,781
I felt as though
I had understood everything

149
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,411
Faded words

150
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:32,625
which I kept so close to me

151
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:38,214
Speechless nights,

152
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,260
a hint of warmth,

153
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:49,142
and this distant yearning for you

154
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,103
I live,

155
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:58,192
simply repeating this cycle

156
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,073
Held in my two hands

157
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:09,829
A droplet of time

158
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:17,754
Softly clutching forgotten memories

159
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

160
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,019
I'll keep these thoughts...

161
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,858
Damn! My body hurts!

162
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,319
And to make it worse,

163
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,489
I've completely lost feeling
in my left arm!

164
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,742
Apparently this power
