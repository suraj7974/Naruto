1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,583
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,603
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,539
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,678
I guess the storm is
going to come soon...

16
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,931
Let's hurry and head back
to the curry shop.

17
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,224
Oh my.

18
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:41,977
That thunder right now...

19
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,730
came from the direction
of the Katabami Gold Mine...

20
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:54,365
Raiga's Counterattack

21
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,583
B-Boss.

22
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,304
R-Ranmaru!

23
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,474
Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,479
Quit joking around.
I'm not laughing...

25
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,315
Hey...Ranmaru...!

26
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,739
You... What did you do
to Ranmaru?

27
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,742
N-No! He...

28
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,748
When Ranmaru held your hand...

29
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,752
you revived and...

30
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,964
And then...Ranmaru...

31
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,643
Ranmaru...

32
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,285
Why is Raiga up?!

33
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,163
I must stop him.

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,037
Thunder?
Could it be?!

35
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,042
You're slow!

36
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,978
Are you...that brat's comrade...?

37
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,926
If it's a wooden weapon, then...

38
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,846
But I can't hold it over my head...

39
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,504
You're annoying!

40
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,483
You little fly...!

41
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,318
Quit buzzing!

42
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,214
I'm...not smart, you know...

43
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,429
I don't know why this happened...

44
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,767
Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!

45
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,311
N-No! That's not true!

46
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,897
Perhaps...the guys from the Leaf...

47
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,527
Oh yeah...
If they didn't come,

48
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,863
then Ranmaru and I would
have been together forever...

49
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,824
Where are they?!

50
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,494
You know, don't you?!
If you don't know, I'll kill you!

51
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,829
I know...

52
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,789
Maybe...!

53
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,468
Take me...where they are...

54
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,011
Go!

55
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,388
Yes!

56
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,354
Hold on, Ranmaru.
For your funeral...

57
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,899
I'll offer up their corpses for you.

58
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,599
Ranmaru...

59
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:59,146
This child... Did he give up his life
in order to revive Raiga?

60
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,565
Rai...ga... Rai...

61
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,567
Ranmaru! You're alive!

62
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,362
Hang in there! Ranmaru!

63
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,697
Ranmaru!

64
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,573
It started raining.

65
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,617
But we're almost done.

66
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,792
Oh my, I'm happy that
you all did this much for me.

67
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,168
Oh no!

68
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,631
Mom! Something horrible happened!

69
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,884
Oh my... What happened, Karashi?

70
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,177
Tenten is...!

71
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,680
What happened to Tenten?

72
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,057
She...fell from a cliff and..

73
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,101
What?!
What do you mean?!

74
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,396
I was running with her and

75
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,024
Tenten said that she would train me
in place of Lee...

76
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,028
But there...when we were
approaching the Lightning Pass,

77
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,905
the lightning struck and
a tree came falling and

78
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:36,451
Tenten fell from the Pass
to the bottom of the cliff!

79
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,621
Oh my! Then you must go
help her out immediately!

80
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,249
Let's go to help, Tenten!

81
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,458
Yeah!

82
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,215
No, I will...

83
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,094
I will come after you guys
with the first-aid kit.

84
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,846
Okay.

85
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,557
Let's go, Naruto, Lee.

86
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,017
-Yes!
-Right!

87
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,648
Oh my, Karashi?

88
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,942
Mom, we're running away
from here.

89
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,236
What are you saying, child?!

90
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
Never mind that!

91
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,699
I'll explain it later,
so hurry up and get ready.

92
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,537
I will wait at the Lightning Pass.

93
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,666
Bring them for sure. If not...

94
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,924
I'll offer up you and your mom's corpses
to Ranmaru...

95
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,970
Mom, please!

96
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,388
I don't want to!

97
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,517
I'm going to wait
until everybody comes back!

98
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,104
Mom! You are so stubborn!

99
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,272
Just come with me!

100
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,448
Do you think that Tenten would
fall off a cliff

101
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,533
merely because of the thunder?

102
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,951
Huh? What do you mean?

103
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,580
That Karashi...
It seems like he wasn't trained enough.

104
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,915
I'm sorry...

105
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,708
Then...

106
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,252
Perhaps...it's some kind
of trap again.

107
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,421
Or he's been threatened
by someone...

108
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,299
But the Kurosuki Family is...!

109
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,301
Maybe my eyes were cloudy...

110
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,928
No way!

111
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,012
It's him...

112
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,275
He's burning up with fever...

113
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,448
Raiga...?

114
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,536
He revived, so you should too...

115
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,416
It's all right. I'm going to die
soon anyway.

116
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,169
No way! I'm not going to let you say
that you're going to die so easily!

117
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:57,092
The people who were killed by you
and Raiga died against their will!

118
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,721
I'm not going to let it go your way!

119
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,100
For the sake of those
whose freedoms you took away.

120
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,227
I'm going to have you
take responsibility!

121
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,065
Are you okay?

122
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,029
The storm... It'll be dangerous
to stay here...

123
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,782
To Grandma's place.

124
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,875
You've come!

125
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,671
-Raiga!
-So he is alive.

126
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,592
This time I'll take you down for sure!
Let's go!

127
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,686
That's not good! Lee!

128
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,110
What are you...?

129
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,284
What is this?

130
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
It's in a whole different level
from before...!

131
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:17,088
Probably that attack was
lightning made of Chakra.

132
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,340
But this one...

133
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,051
Real lightning is used as the source...

134
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:28,600
If he can utilize the power of nature,
unlike Chakra, he'll have no limits!

135
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,897
Get down!

136
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,487
Byakugan!

137
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,826
If we dodge through
the electric shock and

138
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,203
take this to a close-range battle...

139
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,788
Naruto!

140
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,164
I know it!

141
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,878
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

142
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,720
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

143
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,568
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

144
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,319
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

145
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,946
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

146
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,907
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

147
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,367
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

148
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,703
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

149
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,708
Good job, Naruto!

150
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,919
Gentle Fist!

151
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,049
Neji!

152
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,061
You brats! Is that all you know?

153
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,107
Unlike the natural thunder power
I'm using,

154
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,901
Chakra has its limits!

155
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,572
Huh...?

156
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,451
You're an idiot!
There's an idiot here!

157
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:14,164
Is that what you say to an opponent
who fought with all his power?!

158
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,627
You again...

159
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,755
This time I'm not going to
have a funeral for you!

160
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,192
I am angry.

161
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,748
Oh my, what are you doing?!

162
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,542
Please Mom, come with me!

163
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,086
There's no time.

164
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,880
No, I'm going to stay here!

165
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,340
Oh Tenten!

166
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,805
Oh my! This stupid son of mine!

167
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,643
I couldn't help it,
because the boss came back to life...

168
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,104
If we stay here,
we're going to get killed.

169
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,897
The only choice we have
is to run away!

170
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,857
If you want to run away,
then go.

171
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,985
I'm not running away.

172
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,863
I'm not going to give up,
I will save this child.

173
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,873
I will feed this boy
the curry of life!

174
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,125
Grandma...

175
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,253
It's the curry that revived Lee.

176
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,297
Yes.

177
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,595
If anything happens,
it's not my fault!

178
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,147
You!

179
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,819
One, two...
One, two...

180
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,613
One, two... One, two...

181
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,782
One, two... One, two...

182
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,452
This is bad...

183
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,661
This is really bad!

184
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,428
Eat this...you'll feel better.

185
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,517
Please.

186
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,439
You messed up on
mixing the spices.

187
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,565
Oh my?!

188
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:43,248
Karashi, could you have memorized
my recipe of the curry of life?

189
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,003
Karashi...

190
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,137
This is the true curry of life.

191
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,477
Here, please eat this.

192
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,442
You can't even eat
if you're not with Raiga?

193
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,403
Why...?

194
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,030
Why...for a person like me?

195
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,491
Does one need a reason
to save someone?

196
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,494
To save you,

197
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,665
Grandma Sansho and Karashi
did their best to make the curry.

198
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,336
Don't you feel anything seeing
those two trying their best?

199
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,882
If you don't feel anything,
you're a horrible human being!

200
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,346
Human beings support each other
in order to live...

201
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,016
If there are people who need help,
don't others naturally lend them a hand?

202
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,726
Isn't that being human?

203
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,610
Anyway, one bite is fine.
Why don't you try it?

204
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,542
Was it good?

205
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,879
That is what it feels like to live.

206
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,429
Raiga ...

207
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,307
I want him to eat this curry too.

208
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,102
Let's go.

209
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,461
I'm far from finished...!

210
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,174
This guy...
What is up with him?

211
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:22,657
So many things happen

212
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,538
on this endless road, huh?

213
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:34,085
Although you're strong-willed,

214
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:40,258
your voice wavered on the phone today

215
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,387
What dreams

216
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:51,394
did you chase to get here?

217
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:56,399
Even I have times

218
00:21:56,482 --> 00:22:03,364
when
I just don't understand, baby

219
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:09,037
When you're sad,

220
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,876
I'll be close to you

221
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:20,631
Even on nights when we're apart,

222
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:26,512
I'll be close to you

223
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:32,769
I'll be close to you

224
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,070
Damn it! What in the world
happened to my body?!

225
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,115
It is pitch black in front of me,
my entire body is numb,

226
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,868
and my body doesn't do
what I want it to do.

227
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,954
What is this feeling...?

228
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,416
It's warm, my entire body
is burning,

229
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,962
and what is this taste that brings energy
up from the bottom of my stomach...?

230
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,965
