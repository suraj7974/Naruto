1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,882
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:38,914
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,308
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,936
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,636
Who are you guys?

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,721
They want to fight, it seems.

16
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,780
I won't be fooled.
You...you...

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,751
Todoroki!

18
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,634
Stop it, Todoroki!

19
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,346
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?

20
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,810
This guy... There's no way
I'll forgive this guy!

21
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,562
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:30,025
This guy...killed my family...

23
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,486
he killed my little brother!

24
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,489
Wh-What was that...?

25
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,453
Gantetsu killed your family?

26
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,663
Yeah.

27
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,167
Five years ago.

28
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,046
I'm positive that
this is the guy I saw.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,225
Fire...!

30
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,232
Oh!

31
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,861
This is horrible...

32
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,613
Is anybody still inside?

33
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,038
Damn!

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,920
Father! Mother!

35
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,308
Akio.

36
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,564
Akio!

37
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,571
Memory of Flames

38
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,808
Akio...

39
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,712
Todoroki, I found out who
attacked your family.

40
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,463
Really?

41
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,758
A gang of bandits called
the Ninja Dropouts.

42
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,593
Ninja Dropouts?

43
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,638
They're ruthless...
Evil personified...

44
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,559
When they rob the victims
of money and valuables...

45
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,020
They massacre everyone in that house.

46
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,105
Why?

47
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,190
So as not to leave any witnesses behind.

48
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,452
The bodies of your parents
were found but...

49
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:31,040
The fire spread quickly and
Akio was still small so...

50
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,709
Probably nothing of him remained.

51
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,005
I'm sorry, but you need to
let your little brother go...

52
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,090
That's impossible.

53
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,676
I can't do that.

54
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,109
Damn it!

55
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,953
It's ironic, isn't it...

56
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:15,250
When I finally find the killer
of my parents and little brother...

57
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,796
My mission...forces me
to escort him to the capital.

58
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,173
Todoroki.

59
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,053
I'm a full-fledged police officer now.
I'm not a spring chicken!

60
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,849
I didn't mean to bring
my personal grudges onto the job...

61
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,227
This guy will eventually
be sentenced to death...

62
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,355
That thought has allowed me to endure.

63
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,066
But, right now,
right in front of my eyes...

64
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,529
The same face in the flame...
The face that killed my little brother!

65
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,865
Your...little brother?!

66
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,451
Die, Gantetsu!

67
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,208
–Don't get in my way!
–Stop!

68
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,963
He's a thug who's killed
countless innocent people.

69
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,883
It's your mission to deliver Gantetsu
to the capital, right?!

70
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,846
It doesn't matter!
He killed my little brother!

71
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,766
It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but...

72
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,892
You can't do that...

73
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,728
There's nobody watching...

74
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,815
That's right, here in the middle
of this forest.

75
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,483
H-Hey, Todoroki?

76
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,196
Nobody's watching...
There's no way they'll know.

77
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,825
Todoroki... I said, calm down!
I'm telling you, I'm watching!

78
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,953
No, nobody's watching...

79
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,496
Todoroki!

80
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,416
As long as you keep your mouth shut...

81
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,253
No... Better yet, if you weren't around...

82
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,672
Wait a second!

83
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,592
What the heck are you thinking?
Calm down!

84
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,635
I'm extremely calm.

85
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,638
You too must...

86
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,932
It can't be helped...

87
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,352
If things come to this,
I guess I have no choice but to fight!

88
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,523
What's the matter?

89
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,692
Why don't you just come
right out and fight?!

90
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,654
You guys, too! Why don't you stop hiding?
Come out and show yourselves!

91
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,950
Huh?

92
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,869
Y-You guys are...

93
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,787
Stop bullying Gantetsu!

94
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,206
Give Gantetsu back!

95
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,874
What is this?

96
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,251
I have no idea...
Who the heck are they?

97
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,420
Everybody!

98
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,133
W-Wait a minute...

99
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,093
How are you connected
to Gantetsu...?

100
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,183
Stop that!

101
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,517
Let's get out of here!

102
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,068
Calm down. We should be able to
understand each other

103
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,569
if we just try to talk things over.

104
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,821
You guys aren't Shinobi, are you?!

105
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,908
It's dangerous for amateurs
to hold blades!

106
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,160
Lee, what are we gonna do?

107
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,536
This is a problem...

108
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,539
'Cause if our opponents are amateurs,
we can't go all out...

109
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,171
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

110
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,682
Damn it! Let go of me!

111
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:22,145
I need to avenge the deaths
of my family...and my little brother!

112
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,689
Calm down!

113
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,733
Calm down and think about
this whole thing again!

114
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,902
Your...little brother?

115
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,781
Don't be stupid, Gantetsu...
Don't come over here right now!

116
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,121
Gantetsu!

117
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,971
What's going on?!

118
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,851
Damn it, I can't move!

119
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,394
It's futile.

120
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,814
That string is stronger than steel.

121
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,025
There's no way you'll be able
to cut through it

122
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,609
with human strength alone.

123
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,903
Who the heck are you?

124
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,865
I'm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.

125
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,785
Ninja Dropout you said?

126
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,289
I, Monju will take Gantetsu.

127
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,667
As long as I have him,
I have no more business with you guys.

128
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,921
Those nets will shrink
as the temperature rises.

129
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,590
So you'll suffer till the end.

130
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,551
In half an hour or so...

131
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,969
It will cut you into pieces.

132
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,518
Farewell!

133
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,813
Todoroki!

134
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,316
Gantetsu!

135
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,910
Damn it... I'm not about to die
in a place like this.

136
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:10,253
Our mission is to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital...

137
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,131
Are you an idiot?
Take a good look at this situation!

138
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,051
We'll be goners before that happens.

139
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,971
I don't believe that those Ninja Dropouts
are Gantetsu's comrades.

140
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:27,437
Gantetsu was telling the truth.
Those guys might kill Gantetsu.

141
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,773
That's why I should have killed him
with my own hands!

142
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,984
But remember, that guy was
calling out your name to the very end!

143
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,736
So what's up with that?!

144
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,407
There must be something
he wanted to tell you!

145
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,493
I don't want to hear
any excuses from a thug!

146
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:46,289
I find it hard to believe that
Gantetsu's that evil a guy.

147
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,374
What was that?!

148
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,293
I'm telling you,
I'm not about to kick the bucket

149
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:54,005
until I've heard what Gantetsu
wanted to say!

150
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,182
Stop it!

151
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,312
Hey, I'm positive we can work
things out if we just talk.

152
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,480
Shut up!

153
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,525
Wait.
Let's stop this.

154
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,653
I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout,
because you're a Ninja.

155
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,614
We're Shinobi from the Leaf Village.

156
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,992
We were called here to be
part of the police escort

157
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,535
taking Gantetsu to the capital.

158
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,204
Please spare Gantetsu.

159
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,706
That can't happen.

160
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,419
Gantetsu saved us from
the Ninja Dropouts.

161
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,712
Saved you?

162
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,755
Who in the world are you guys?

163
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,886
We're all kids whose families
were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.

164
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,348
But Gantetsu secretly rescued us

165
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,976
because he wanted to save
at least the children...

166
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,561
What was that?!

167
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,899
Gantetsu took care of all of us kids
who had become orphans...

168
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,959
Gantetsu.

169
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,552
Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?

170
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,013
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,727
Where am I?

172
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,062
So you woke up.

173
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,066
Mother...? Father...?

174
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,194
Where's Mother?

175
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:43,490
You poor thing...
But we're all in the same boat.

176
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,910
You're not alone...
We're here for you...

177
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,538
We're your new family.

178
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,464
I'm leaving the Ninja Dropouts!

179
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,926
I can't stand this any longer.

180
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,514
I can't commit robberies with
those guys anymore.

181
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,559
But if you don't,
they'll kill you, Gantetsu.

182
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,312
-I'll steal their money.
-Huh?

183
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,815
And I'll get myself captured
by the police.

184
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,024
Come on...

185
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,776
If I do that,

186
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,697
they'll show up in front of
the prison to try to get me back.

187
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,740
That's the only way
they can be captured.

188
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,742
Are you saying you're gonna
be a decoy...?

189
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,454
It's so that there won't be
any more victims.

190
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,040
This is my only choice.

191
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,504
Gantetsu really did steal their money
and was captured by the police.

192
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,673
We came to this forest

193
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,968
because we were worried
about Gantetsu's safety.

194
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,973
We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts
would get caught. However...

195
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,726
So Gantetsu reformed himself

196
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,978
and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?

197
00:14:55,478 --> 00:15:00,191
We have to do something about
the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!

198
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,694
I don't really care about
the Ninja Dropouts right now.

199
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,864
What's important is that
we rescue Gantetsu.

200
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,701
I'm guessing that Gantetsu
is with Naruto.

201
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,413
Don't worry because he won't have
been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.

202
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,417
Okay, let's believe that.

203
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,967
Damn...

204
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,607
If things continue like this,
we'll turn into dried fish.

205
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,326
Huh?

206
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,455
H-Hey... It loosens up a little
when sweat soaks into it.

207
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,624
What?
Are you serious?

208
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, you're right.

209
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,636
Yeah, I know...

210
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,147
What?!

211
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,112
I'm used to its venom.
It's nothing.

212
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,791
I find it hard to believe
that Gantetsu's that evil a guy.

213
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,169
I'm gonna meet up with Gantetsu
one more time

214
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,713
and find out for myself,
no matter what it takes...

215
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,761
That's right...
I need to see Gantetsu again, too.

216
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,473
I will then avenge the deaths
of my family...and of my little brother.

217
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,866
We did it!

218
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,784
That was a narrow escape!

219
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:19,122
All right... Let's hurry up and
rescue Gantetsu!

220
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,794
Yeah... I will find him no matter what
and I'll cut him down!

221
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,842
Huh?

222
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,310
–Gantetsu.
–Huh?

223
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,104
That's definitely Gantetsu.

224
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,230
Those guys are...

225
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,818
I-Idiot...

226
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,158
–Gantetsu!
–Gantetsu!

227
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,409
Gantetsu!

228
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,914
That's as far as you'll go, kid.

229
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,291
That guy is...

230
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,834
Don't tell me he's a Ninja Dropout?!

231
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,629
Good answer.

232
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,590
I'm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.

233
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,008
Give Gantetsu back!

234
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,301
I'm not forgiving you for this!

235
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,595
Hey, hey...

236
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,222
Who are these little brats?

237
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,766
Perhaps they're inexperienced
in the ways of the world, but...

238
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,228
to tell me to give Gantetsu back...

239
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,398
Give us back what we want.
That's our line, right?

240
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,235
Who the heck are you guys?

241
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,986
You Ninja Dropout jerks...

242
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,488
We are avenging our families' deaths!

243
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,697
What?!

244
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,416
You brats just stay quiet.

245
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,627
Damn it!

246
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,214
Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!

247
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,050
It looks like you don't quite comprehend
the position you're in right now, huh?!

248
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,680
And moreover, what do they mean
by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!

249
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,433
Stop!

250
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,395
Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!

251
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,358
It's my turn!

252
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,573
It doesn't even budge.

253
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,659
It's useless... You won't be able to
tear through this net.

254
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,787
Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.

255
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,455
I refuse.

256
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,416
Huh... I see.

257
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,960
Then how about this?

258
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,507
Akio!

259
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,845
Stop it! I get it.
I'll talk, so please stop!

260
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,389
You should have done that
from the start.

261
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,517
These children are the children
from the homes

262
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,354
that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.

263
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,774
I rescued them and gave them shelter.

264
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,652
What? You betrayed us?

265
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,821
I see... You jerk...

266
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,033
You took our treasures and
gave them to these guys.

267
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,077
They belonged to their families
in the first place.

268
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,540
Don't mess around with me...
You traitor!

269
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,001
Stop that!

270
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,921
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

271
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,423
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!

272
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,593
-Naruto!
-Naruto, you were safe!

273
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,553
Of course I was!

274
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,558
I'm not handing Gantetsu over
to you no matter what!

275
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,942
Gantetsu.

276
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,717
That's...

277
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,886
It can't be...!

278
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:10,061
The Key to the rusted heart's door

279
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:15,817
Will always be smiling right near by

280
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,452
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

281
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:30,999
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

282
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,753
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

283
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:40,508
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

284
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,971
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

285
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:49,934
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

286
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:54,105
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

287
00:21:54,188 --> 00:22:01,195
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

288
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,742
The wind is probably testing our hearts

289
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,621
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

290
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:15,209
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

291
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:20,131
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

292
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

293
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,600
Will always be smiling right near by

294
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,649
Is that the Ninja Dropout's hideout?

295
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,903
Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.

296
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,406
Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards.
I can never forgive them.

297
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,950
How dare they interfere with
the happy reunion of the siblings!

298
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,077
This is outrageous.

299
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,787
All right, let's go, Bushy-Brows!

300
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,373
I'm always okay to go.
Even if the enemy is an ex-Shinobi...

301
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,209
We're going to beat them one and all,

302
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,836
and definitely going to get
Todoroki's brother back!

303
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,464
Next time: "To Each His Own Path"
