1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:26,110
I just want to convey

3
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,497
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:44,295
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,136
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:57,183
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:04,231
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,238
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,784
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

12
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,412
creating a river of tears

13
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

14
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,338
and melting away

15
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,147
Damn!

16
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,901
Pretty impressive...

17
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,656
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.

18
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,617
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?

19
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,829
Since it is a pretty complicated song...

20
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,164
Well...

21
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,209
Not only did you
immediately understand

22
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,962
that I'm manipulating
these guys with my flute

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,506
but you understood
how difficult this song is.

24
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,091
You're a pretty impressive punk.

25
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,304
But you can't completely
understand this song.

26
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:23,269
True... Since art is so foreign to me.

27
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,857
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,152
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns

29
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,739
to control each and every movement
of those guys...

30
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm pretty confident when it comes
to just analyzing,

31
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,204
but this time it's not looking good.

32
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,332
The reason is...

33
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,086
I don't understand
musical notes whatsoever.

34
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,508
Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!

35
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,519
I'll specially show you
the Camellia Dance next.

36
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,688
I'll crush you!

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,652
You shouldn't say things
you can't even do.

38
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,362
Shut up!

39
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,004
What?!

40
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,300
I told you.

41
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,053
This bone is harder than steel.

42
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,936
You should have a taste of it
with your own body.

43
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,303
Damn!

44
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,151
There's no one that's heard
this song and lived.

45
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,453
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!

46
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,428
The melody's changed!

47
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,890
Something's gonna come!

48
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,281
What the...?!

49
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,338
What?

50
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,808
This is...?

51
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,109
The speed at which he flees
after determining

52
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,903
that these Material Ghosts
are dangerous...

53
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,363
Pretty impressive.

54
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,574
But...

55
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,796
I've used my precious Paper Bombs
and Smoke Bombs all at once

56
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,881
and all I could do was hide.

57
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,051
That white one...

58
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,222
bit off my physical energy.

59
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,855
Seeing that shuriken passed through,

60
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,359
that thing is semi-materialistic
with very little mass.

61
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,320
It's Chakra itself with an appetite.

62
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,742
It's probably Chakra that's shaped
mostly by mental energy.

63
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,788
That's why it seeks stability
and craves for physical energy.

64
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,458
If I continue dealing with
those "Hungry Chakra"

65
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,085
I won't be able to build up my Chakra.

66
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,130
They're pretty dangerous.

67
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,926
She's a Shinobi who can
make special Chakra like me...

68
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,220
It's without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.

69
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,516
Which means I should leave
the white thing alone

70
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,518
and aim for the main body!

71
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,356
The quickest way would be
to stop the sound of the flute, but...

72
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:24,403
it'd be impossible to get close to
that woman in this situation.

73
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:31,869
The next thing would be to capture
those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.

74
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,707
But that's difficult too since they're
attacking me separately at different times.

75
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:42,796
If I let even one escape
I'd be attacked and it'd be the end...

76
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,301
There aren't any openings in
either offense or defense this woman...

77
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,929
Heh! She might be
a pretty good Shogi player.

78
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,602
My remaining Ninja tools
are twelve kunai knives,

79
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:02,357
nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,
one Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb...

80
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,235
Man...

81
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,448
I feel like I'm playing without
rooks or bishops.

82
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,051
Did I lose them?

83
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,179
I guess that's not possible...

84
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,848
Akamaru?

85
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,565
Here. Eat this, Akamaru.

86
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,776
If you don't eat you won't
get your strength back.

87
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,037
All right. Akamaru, let's go!

88
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,581
There's the issue of those guys too...

89
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,296
Dance of the Camellia!

90
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,624
There's no use hiding.

91
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,962
Unless you can predict
these guys' movements

92
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,714
there's nowhere you can run, little rat.

93
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,550
I'll find you and break you
into pieces right away!

94
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,475
Now then...

95
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,444
All right. Everything's ready.
All that remains is to do it.

96
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,781
There'll be nine attacks.

97
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,366
The outcome will be decided
during the attacks.

98
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,955
One!

99
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,543
One!

100
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,684
Wishful thinking!

101
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,395
The Jutsu manipulated by
this sound is invincible.

102
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,607
Whatever plans you have
to win against me...is useless!

103
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,961
Two!

104
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,509
Scampering around, you little rat!
Where are you?!

105
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,848
Three!

106
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,439
So you're over there!

107
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,330
Four!

108
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,711
So it's a cheap trick.
You think you can make a fool of me?!

109
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,677
Five...six...

110
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,512
seven...eight...

111
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,698
Scurrying around to get away.
What is he thinking?

112
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,379
Light?!
Nine!

113
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,589
Oh no!

114
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,675
He's lengthened the shadows
with light and ...

115
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,552
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

116
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,432
Shadow Possession Jutsu...
a success!

117
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,100
That's impossible...

118
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,103
How were you able to predict
these guys' movements?!

119
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,275
There's no way you could have heard
the differences in my music patterns!

120
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,405
I wasn't listening to
the sounds at all.

121
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,699
There's something other
than the sounds

122
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
that give away your command patterns,
isn't there?

123
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,459
Your fingers!

124
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,461
It can't be!

125
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,838
The movement of the three...

126
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,257
Are you saying you memorized
my finger movements and predicted?

127
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,136
There's no way that's possible!

128
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,473
Your right index finger
and ring finger...

129
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,940
The sound that you make
with those

130
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,484
along with the left middle finger
and pinkie,

131
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,737
that middle crab pincher man
stands ready.

132
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,450
Your right thumb and index finger,

133
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,413
and your left index finger and pinkie,
the club man charges.

134
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,545
While you were dodging my attacks
and looking for me,

135
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,591
I was observing each and every one
of your finger moves in detail...

136
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:06,388
analyzing and memorizing them.

137
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,480
It's no use...

138
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,316
They're bound by
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

139
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,822
The most interesting rule
of the Shogi play is that

140
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,703
you can use pieces you obtain
as your own pieces.

141
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,207
From here on out...
it's my turn to attack...

142
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,128
This time I'll hunt you down
using the three pieces.

143
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,299
You're looking pretty composed.

144
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,551
Stand ready with a kunai knife
at least.

145
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,053
My weapon is just this flute!

146
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,347
I told you that there hasn't been a person

147
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,017
who's heard the sound of
this flute and lived, idiot!

148
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,019
That's some confidence!

149
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,817
Retreat!

150
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,701
Too bad you aren't able to
use the pieces, hey!

151
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,874
Next it's my turn!

152
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,087
What?!

153
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,257
Shadow Possession Jutsu,
successful.

154
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,651
I told you.

155
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,195
That I'd hunt you down
using the pieces.

156
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,658
I used the three pieces as bait.

157
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,703
In attacking, the first hand
is the trick, a fake.

158
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,623
The basics are to score
with the second hand.

159
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,333
Bastard...

160
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,384
It can't be helped.

161
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,928
Now that it's come to this
I'll need to force out with power.

162
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,932
I didn't think that I'd get to
second state in a place like this...

163
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,267
It ticks me off but...

164
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,019
I'll acknowledge it.

165
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,730
This guy was a pretty impressive scum.

166
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,906
What is...this?

167
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,620
It's true you're somewhat sharp, but...

168
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,832
It won't go as
you've planned from here!

169
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,834
What?!

170
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,925
Is she gonna force herself out
of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?

171
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,094
What's with that tremendous Chakra?

172
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,806
The Jutsu's gonna come loose!

173
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,058
I can't be worrying about
saving Chakra anymore.

174
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,939
There's no other way
but to use that Jutsu!

175
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,400
Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

176
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,493
Is he grabbing my body
with the shadow?

177
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,830
It's just as if I'm being grabbed
by a real hand...

178
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,624
But, no more than this!

179
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,919
Damn! What an incredible strength.

180
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,005
At this distance
I'll lose to that strength!

181
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,549
Take this!

182
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,011
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

183
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,769
This is bad!

184
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,146
Is this a...Genjutsu?

185
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,238
Where are you aiming?

186
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,124
I can't move my body...

187
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,404
While in second stage,

188
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,324
I manipulate many Genjutsu
with my flute.

189
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,370
Of those, this one is
an appropriate for that little rat.

190
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,579
The reason is...

191
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,045
This Genjutsu stops the movement
of the prey and ties it up!

192
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,176
How's that? How's it feel to
be the one tied up?

193
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,310
So this was your last move huh?

194
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,313
Unfortunately, it's a return checkmate!

195
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,233
Little rat!

196
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,280
What...?

197
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,578
This guy...

198
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,746
He broke his own finger
with his own shadow!

199
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,250
Did he release the Genjutsu
with that pain?

200
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,378
On top of that, he kept pretending to
be bound by the Jutsu?!

201
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,384
I told you this already

202
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,845
that the first hand is the trick,
a fake.

203
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,890
The basics are to score
with the second move.

204
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,520
Moreover this second move...
it's a little different from earlier.

205
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,938
With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,

206
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:54,861
the closer in distance you are
to the subject the stronger the hold.

207
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,865
Damn. I carelessly got too close...

208
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,992
No, that's not it.

209
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,623
The most careless thing was
the words you said earlier,

210
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,833
"my weapon is just the flute."

211
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,836
You're looking pretty composed.

212
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,255
Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.

213
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,758
My weapon is just this flute!

214
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,636
I told you that
there hasn't been a person

215
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,721
who's heard the sound of this flute
and lived, idiot!

216
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,765
No way...

217
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,100
That's right.

218
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:30,605
The reason I threw the kunai knife
right in front of you and missed...

219
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:36,986
was to lead you to pick it up
and come closer to me, you see?

220
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,606
For the first time, I spoke to you

221
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,567
And you smiled

222
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,028
For the first time, I was able to speak

223
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,906
In my own words

224
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,578
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

225
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:32,792
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

226
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:38,798
My clumsy attempts with words

227
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:44,387
You listened without turning away

228
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:50,893
No wonder I get carried away by you

229
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:57,900
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

230
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,653
I feel so sad

231
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,946
But...

232
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,115
For the first time, I spoke to you

233
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,909
And you smiled

234
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,871
For the first time, I was able to speak

235
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,582
In my own words

236
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,460
For the first time, I spoke to you

237
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,755
And you smiled

238
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,466
For the first time, I was able to speak

239
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,302
In my own words

240
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:29,140
For the first time, I spoke to you

241
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,941
No way, that's ridiculous!

242
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,736
Am I having a dream or something?!

243
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,489
But it's too intense to be a dream!

244
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,867
That suit with its outstanding
ventilation and supple fit.

245
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,787
On top of that, those eyes,
that hair, those eyebrows!

246
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,625
You! Why are you here...?!

247
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,420
Next time: "The Leaf's Handsome Devil!"

248
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,756
I sense the approach of a storm!
