1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,336
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,922
Now

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,804
I like your determination!

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,972
Then...

21
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,934
For those who are still here...

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,353
The first test...

23
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,650
you have passed it!

24
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,826
You've passed through the gates!

25
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,831
The first test for the Chunin Exams
has been completed...

26
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,543
I wish you well.

27
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,003
All right! Wish us well!

28
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,385
What a funny guy...

29
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,613
Huh...

30
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,407
I didn't think that there would be
a guy who would pass the first test

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,284
with a blank test sheet.

32
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,788
Naruto Uzumaki. He really is a funny guy.

33
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:10,733
The Chunin Exam Stage 2:
The Forest of Death!

34
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,078
There's something kind
of creepy about this place.

35
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:29,251
This place is called the Forest of Death,
you'll soon realize why.

36
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:36,175
"The Forest of Death,
you'll soon realize why."

37
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,677
That kind of threat won't work
on me one bit!

38
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,931
I'm not scared!

39
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,224
Really?

40
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,393
You've got a lot of energy.

41
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,112
A kid like you dies at very beginning,

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,618
dappled with the red blood I like.

43
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,003
I'm returning your...Kunai Knife...

44
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,130
Thank you for taking the trouble...

45
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,810
But...don't stand behind me,
thirsty for blood.

46
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,522
If you don't want a quick death...

47
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:38,529
Well, it's my nature to act up
at the sight of red blood.

48
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,826
And my precious hair was cut,
so I got excited...

49
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,454
Naruto...

50
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,789
I'm sorry...

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,003
W-What with that Proctor?

52
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,629
Frankly, she's psycho!

53
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,840
This one, too...

54
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,802
That girl, why was her tongue so long?

55
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:08,017
Evidently, we've got
a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.

56
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,562
This will be fun.

57
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,899
You're the most hot-blooded! Believe it!

58
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:23,532
Well, before we start the second exam,
I have to pass this out to you!

59
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,373
It's a consent form,

60
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:35,210
before you can take part
in the test you have to sign this.

61
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,378
Why?

62
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,423
From here on out,
corpses are going to come out,

63
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,092
I have to get your consent to that!

64
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,304
Or it'll be my responsibility.

65
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,440
Well, I'm going to start
the explanation for the second exam.

66
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,235
In a word, the limits of
your survival will be challenged.

67
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:08,911
Survival, huh? This test is a total pain.

68
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:13,582
First, I'll give you step-by-step instruction
on the terrain of this Training Field.

69
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,088
Training Field Number 44 is surrounded
by 44 locked entrance gates,

70
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,926
there are rivers and a forest
and a tower in the middle.

71
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,096
It's about 10 kilometers
from the towers to the gate...

72
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:32,643
In this confined area, you will
go through a certain survival program.

73
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,271
The contents of which are...

74
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,821
anything goes scroll battle!

75
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,490
Scroll...?
Yes...

76
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:53,288
I want you to fight for two scrolls,
the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.

77
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,672
All together 26 teams got
through the first test.

78
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,215
Half of them...

79
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:08,887
13 teams get the Heaven scroll,
the other half get the Earth Scroll.

80
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll hand over one scroll to each team.

81
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,852
To put it simply,
that's what you're vying for.

82
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,105
And the conditions to pass?

83
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:23,068
Three of you bring both the Heaven and
Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.

84
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:29,533
That means that of the 13 teams,
half of them will fail for sure...

85
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,952
Except it has to be in time.

86
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,956
For this second exam,
the time limit is 120 hours.

87
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,167
Do it in exactly five days!

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,585
Five days.

89
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,128
What do we do about food?

90
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,840
Be self-sufficient! It's a treasure trove
in the wilderness.

91
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,050
There's more than enough for food...

92
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,719
However...

93
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,096
It's teeming with
fierce people-eating animals,

94
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,932
poison bugs, poisonous weeds and
much more.

95
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,684
No way...

96
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,896
Fool, that's why it's called survival!

97
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:05,319
Besides, it's improbable that 39 people,
13 teams will pass.

98
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,405
The interval for activity gets longer
with passing each day,

99
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,117
while the time for recovery gets shorter...

100
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,994
Seems pretty grueling!

101
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,457
On top of that, you're surrounded
by nothing but enemies,

102
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,210
even falling asleep will be a problem...

103
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:25,214
And, besides those injured
during attempts to capture scrolls...

104
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,507
there will definitely be people

105
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,677
are unable to endure
the rigors of the course.

106
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,681
Umm...so you can quit in the middle of it?

107
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,102
According to the rules,
you cannot give up in the middle of it!

108
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,147
I want you to spend
five days in the forest.

109
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,775
Just like I thought...

110
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,402
This is going to be a pain!

111
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:51,281
Moving on, conditions of disqualification.

112
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,826
Number 1, if all three members
of the team can't make it to the tower

113
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,622
with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls
within the time limit.

114
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:05,629
Number 2, if a team loses a member
or if a member became incapacitated.

115
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,715
There's that, and this is a supplement...

116
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,801
Absolutely do not look at
the contents of the scrolls

117
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,345
until you have reached the tower!

118
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,224
W-What happens if we look
at it halfway through?

119
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:22,562
When you look at it you'll find...out!

120
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,022
Huh?

121
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,778
There are times when a Chunin
must deal with super-secret text.

122
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,197
This is to test your reliability.

123
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,532
That's all the explanation!

124
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,576
I'll exchange your three consent forms for
the scrolls in that hut over there.

125
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,665
After that, pick your entrance,
and all the gates will open simultaneously!

126
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,546
Finally, just a word of advice...

127
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,215
Don't die!

128
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,745
I see, so you won't know which
scroll was given to each team...

129
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,916
and you won't know which of
the three people is carrying the scroll.

130
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,586
If what Ibiki said was right,

131
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,299
there will be life or death
struggles for information in this test.

132
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,761
Everyone is an enemy!

133
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641
The resolve of everyone here is strong.

134
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,103
That means that it might come
to killing each other.

135
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,109
It looks like they understand the meaning
of the consent form a little bit...

136
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,075
Heeey, look who's here!

137
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,036
It's Billboard Brow, isn't it?

138
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,541
I thought you went home long ago,
I never imagined you were still here.

139
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,755
Ooooh? Look who's here, the ugly Inopig.

140
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,675
Starting now, it's five days of
the survival test with Sasuke.

141
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,011
There's no reason to go home.

142
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,307
– Ugly!
– Billboard!

143
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,225
– Ugly! Ugly!
– Billboard! Billboard!

144
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,810
– Ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!

145
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,561
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!
– Ugly ugly ugly!

146
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,897
– Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!

147
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,108
Sakura, this is impossible for you.

148
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,568
For your own sake,
just hurry up and go home!

149
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,071
I could say the exact same thing to you!

150
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,289
Hey, why are those two on such bad terms?

151
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,252
D-Do you think I care about
something stupid like that?

152
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,841
Man...all there is to do is write my name,

153
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,884
why does it take this much time!

154
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,140
Hey! Hinata! What are you
doing over there?

155
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,101
N-Naruto...

156
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,687
Umm...uhhhh...well...

157
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,399
Just like I thought, this kid is strange.

158
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,026
A scratch...

159
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,155
Uh-um... this...is...

160
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,739
See ya!

161
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,705
Naruto...

162
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,169
It's about time for the scroll exchange.

163
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,683
Well, I wonder how
many teams will survive...

164
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,239
Teams who have taken the scroll,

165
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,659
stay with the representative
and move to the gate!

166
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,162
We'll all start simultaneously
in 30 minutes!!

167
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,135
Yeah! Survival is our forte!

168
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,263
Hinata, don't show your weakness.

169
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,890
Uh, okay...

170
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,184
Life or death...

171
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,853
It's a pain but we just have to do this.

172
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,523
Since it's come to this,
Naruto will be our target.

173
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,526
For snacks, there's potato chips...

174
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,070
– What about shortcake...?
– I can't believe you two!

175
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,740
Okaaaay! I won't lose!

176
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,035
I'll bring down whoever comes near me.

177
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,497
– Yes!
– Cha!

178
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,963
Heh heh...finally the opportunity is here...

179
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,466
We have the chance to fulfill
our mission in earnest...

180
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,599
Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,

181
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,603
I'm really scared of spending
five days with this guy.

182
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,108
Target the rookies first.

183
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,986
They said that from now on
it's okay to kill,

184
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,612
which makes it easier.

185
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:30,954
Master Guy, I'll do my best!
I'll definitely succeed!

186
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:48,972
We now start the second
test of the Chunin Exam!

187
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,978
Look for the brats!

188
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,479
Those three, right?

189
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,192
All right! Let's go!

190
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,830
Okay! First, we search for that thing.

191
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,166
Can you do it, Hinata?
Yes.

192
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,879
Byakugan!

193
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,135
Slow down, Lee! We just started.

194
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,929
I know. But...

195
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,974
I can't stay still!

196
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,685
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us.

197
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,064
Hot-blooded fool...

198
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,859
As you already understand,
we have only one target!

199
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,335
W-What are you doing, Choji?

200
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:07,008
Just a little break...
I'm already tired, and hungry...

201
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,719
What are you suddenly saying?!

202
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,306
It hasn't been five minutes
since we started!

203
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,726
But I can't help it. I'm hungry...

204
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,605
You! If you were able to bring snacks,

205
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,775
you should have been able
to bring one Kunai knife!

206
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,402
Ino! Hide!

207
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,585
Uh-oh!

208
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,181
This kind of thing continuing
for five days...?

209
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,528
Anyway, the tower is the
goal for everyone, right?

210
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:13,241
So it would be clever for us to make
a trap in the vicinity of the tower.

211
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,495
Okay...wasting no time, huh?

212
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,997
Where are they?

213
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,126
Heh...kids.

214
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,171
It's like begging to be found,
standing in that conspicuous place.

215
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,798
They sensed our presence,

216
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,719
but, evidently they haven't
grasped where we are.

217
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,389
What happened? You're pale.

218
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,478
W-What is that?!

219
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:55,325
The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village
sense body temperature and perspiration,

220
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,202
then in mass, swoop down on their prey.

221
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,038
If they continue to suck
your blood for five minutes,

222
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,414
you go to the other world...

223
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,083
Using this behavior,

224
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,628
we'd set a trap on the path
enemies would use to escape.

225
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,923
D-Darn it...

226
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,222
That's one team gone!

227
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,983
It sounds like they've already started.

228
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,447
Wasn't that someone screaming just now?

229
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,331
I-I'm kinda getting nervous.

230
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,252
I-It was nothing. Sakura. Believe it!

231
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,423
I-I have to pee...

232
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,968
Y-You...fool!

233
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,679
What are you doing in front of a lady!

234
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,430
Go to the grass!

235
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,607
Aaah, that was a lot! I'm refreshed.

236
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,986
Like I said, not in front of a lady...!

237
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,203
S-Sasuke... no matter what,
you don't have to go that far.

238
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,581
W-What was that for...?

239
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,719
What are you doing...all of a sudden?!

240
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,222
What you ask? That's my line, isn't it?

241
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,682
Sasuke!

242
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,642
It can't be helped!

243
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,824
Sasuke, please stop!

244
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,659
Look closely at him!

245
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,789
Talk! Where's the real Naruto!

246
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,752
I have no idea what you're talking about!

247
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,420
What happened to the scratch on you face?

248
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:20,053
I'm asking what happened to the scratch
you got before from the Proctor!

249
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,598
And your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.

250
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,892
That guy's right handed!

251
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:32,231
You're worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!

252
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,488
Unlucky! You got me. In that case...

253
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,949
Which one of you got the scroll?

254
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,372
If you listen to me obediently,
I'll spare your lives.

255
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,631
I see! Then I'll resort to force!

256
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,103
Hey, can you hear it?

257
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,855
The clear,

258
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:18,403
blue sky goes on and on

259
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:26,369
The ocean spans limitlessly

260
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:35,378
Please keep that smile on your face forever

261
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:43,261
Or else I'll cry

262
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

263
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,727
It's all ok now.

264
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,566
Everyone is inside

265
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,986
this hand

266
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,864
when you want to cry,

267
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,199
and you want to run away

268
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,662
When you forget what happiness is

269
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,666
Just sing.

270
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,880
Light is born, and darkness was born

271
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,132
The two are one

272
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:27,430
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

273
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:33,352
Hey, can you hear it?

274
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,817
Aww, stupid gas mask man!

275
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,820
Suddenly sneaking up on someone
when they're peeing!

276
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,239
I messed up just a little bit.

277
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,075
Now I have to hurry and
meet up with Sakura.

278
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,744
Wait a minute! What is this giant snake?

279
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,831
Hey! Are you serious?! Wait a minute, hey!

280
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,084
I've been gulped down!

281
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,171
Next episode: "Eat or Be Eaten:
Panic in the Forest"

282
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,632
Will I return to action?!
