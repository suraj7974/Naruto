1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:17,059
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,022
<=title>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,566
You never know what it is

18
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,903
when you get it or lose it

19
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,282
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

20
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

21
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

22
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,711
let's start walking

23
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,755
One more time

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,940
Sasuke's Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!

25
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,039
There you are!

26
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,673
I'm here!

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,532
I'm returning them to you!

28
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,126
So it's a clone...

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,133
Bastard!

30
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,682
Sasuke...Uchiha...!

31
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,727
Why won't you come at me?!

32
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,946
Why...

33
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,657
do you flee?!

34
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,577
Ready?

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,245
Over here!

36
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,125
Over here!

37
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,919
Wait!

38
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,963
Pass!

39
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,716
Here! Good one!

40
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,260
Good! Go! Go! Go!

41
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,852
Power shot!

42
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,985
What're we gonna do?

43
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,531
We don't know any wall-climbing
techniques or anything...

44
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,710
Y-You're...

45
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,344
This...

46
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,179
It's Gaara...

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,889
Gaara of Sand...

48
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,933
R-Run!

49
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:33,983
Wait!

50
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,985
Don't leave me alone!

51
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,947
Help me!

52
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:43,993
I don't...

53
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,871
want to be alone anymore!

54
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,088
Really...

55
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,674
No!

56
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,807
Gaara! Please calm down!

57
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,810
Yashamaru...

58
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,098
No escape!

59
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:53,020
I won't let you escape!
Sasuke Uchiha!

60
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,460
You've gotta be kidding!
What's with that outrageous strength...?

61
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,089
Are you afraid of me?

62
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,424
It's too overwhelming...

63
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,929
Sasuke Uchiha!

64
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,475
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of my existence?!

65
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,981
Don't forget...
You are my prey.

66
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,944
Wait!

67
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,158
Why are you fixated
on me so much?

68
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,962
Those eyes that know true loneliness...

69
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:09,638
And eyes that know that
it is the world's greatest suffering...

70
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,223
I think I told you.

71
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,018
That you have the same eyes as me.

72
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,521
Eyes that lust for power,

73
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,983
overflowing with hatred
and murderous intent...

74
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,945
The same as me...

75
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,575
Eyes that burn to kill those
who drove you...

76
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,288
into a hell called loneliness!

77
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,962
Such are your eyes.

78
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,637
Okay. Just a minute.

79
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,808
So you're called Gaara...

80
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,063
I don't know what you know
about Sasuke, but...

81
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,900
It's not good for you to
speak as though

82
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,818
you perceive everything about Sasuke!

83
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,864
What is it that you want to say
to him before the final round,

84
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,657
by pursuing him so far?

85
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,036
A battle is where...

86
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,041
another's existence and one's own
existence are put on the line...

87
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,920
and each tries to kill the other!

88
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:30,385
Only the winner can actually feel
the value of his own existence.

89
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,763
In other words,
what you want to say is...

90
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,933
let's have a killing bout and
not a match?

91
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,605
Uchiha... You really should
be wanting it, too...

92
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,899
in the depths of your soul...

93
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,986
You want to confirm
the value of your existence.

94
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,782
Am I really, truly powerful?

95
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,661
Is my existence more powerful
than my opponent

96
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,247
who faces me with eyes
filled with intent to kill?

97
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,850
What's the matter?!

98
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,937
Sasuke Uchiha!

99
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,815
Are you afraid of me?!

100
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,904
Your hatred and intent to kill...

101
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,283
have they given way to fear?

102
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,744
Is that the extent of your existence?!

103
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,291
Fight me...and confirm it!

104
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,962
Your value! Your existence!

105
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,755
Experience it!

106
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,008
If you want an answer...

107
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,136
Come at me!

108
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,273
I was allowed to live...

109
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,610
Only...myself.

110
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,988
Expressly for what reason?!

111
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,577
No... I know the reason.

112
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,623
The reason that man left me alive
was so he wouldn't be tormented

113
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,085
by a sense of guilt for having killed
an entire clan...

114
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:33,633
Itachi chose me as the avenger...

115
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,720
in order to have me kill him!

116
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,573
Now, let me have some fun...
Sasuke Uchiha!

117
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,244
I'll finish it with one blow!

118
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,872
Hurry up and die,
release yourself from your misery.

119
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,500
You silly old fool...

120
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,588
I believe I told you...
that you would die too!

121
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,298
Bastard!

122
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,225
Let go, you old fool!

123
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,854
I will not let go!
I refuse to let go...

124
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,441
until I have pulled out your soul!

125
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,413
At this rate...

126
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,655
Gaara!

127
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,413
Looks like it worked...

128
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,065
I see! That's what it was!

129
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,566
That's not possible...

130
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,403
He countered Gaara's attack
in that condition?!

131
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,497
I just realized the reason...
why it's so fun!

132
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,375
This pain...

133
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,546
To take down an opponent
who wounded me...

134
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,257
and thoroughly destroy him...!

135
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,010
That will make me truly feel alive!

136
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,767
Gaara's never had a single wound,
but he got Gaara twice.

137
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,146
Is he...a freak?!

138
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,984
No...a true freak is...

139
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,323
After all, the only thing Gaara is
transforming is still just his right arm.

140
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,414
More, more!

141
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,207
What?!

142
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,178
What the heck is this guy?!

143
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,389
One after another...

144
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,103
Here goes!

145
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,772
He's even faster!

146
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,746
I can't dodge unless
I read ahead of his movements.

147
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,041
If I didn't have these eyes
I'd have died long ago.

148
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,005
I can no longer use Chidori...

149
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,842
Fire Style...
Fire Ball Jutsu!

150
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,685
So the Fire Style doesn't
work against sand...

151
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,480
Not only that,
this level of Jutsu won't...

152
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,607
Die!

153
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,942
Apparently...it needs to be Chidori!

154
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,638
Well! Your limit is two shots.
That's about it...

155
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,149
This is as many Chidori
you can shoot in one day

156
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,442
with your present Chakra.

157
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,488
After all, this Chidori is a technique
that can only be used

158
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,657
in conjunction with Sharingan
during actual battles.

159
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,538
But using Sharingan and
another Jutsu simultaneously means

160
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:41,042
exploding and using up the Chakra
in your body all at once.

161
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,678
Well! But you really are
one of the more impressive ones.

162
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,972
Even with my Chidori...

163
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,766
If I use the Lightning Blade
four times in a day,

164
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,853
I'd completely use up my Chakra.

165
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,776
What would happen if I tried
to use more than two shots?

166
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,032
The third shot won't be activated...

167
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,201
Remember this well!

168
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,330
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate...

169
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,541
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,

170
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,168
but your Chakra will deplete to zero...

171
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,629
And in the worst case, you'll die!

172
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:34,304
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.

173
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,974
Especially in your case.

174
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,734
What's the matter?

175
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,821
Does the value of your existence
amount to only this much?

176
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,491
I'll be blunt...

177
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,452
You are...weak!

178
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,917
You're too optimistic.

179
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,878
And it's because your hatred
is weak!

180
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,634
The power of hatred is
the power of the intent to kill!

181
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,721
The power of the intent to kill
is the power of revenge!

182
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,397
Your hatred is weaker than mine!

183
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,525
Shut up...

184
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,321
Do you understand
the meaning of this?!

185
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,531
Shut up!

186
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:40,286
That means that you...
You are weaker than me!

187
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:50,171
Itachi chose me to be the avenger...
to have me kill him!

188
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,884
I am an avenger!

189
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,670
The Curse Mark again...

190
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,513
Darn...! My body...

191
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,534
Sasuke!

192
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

193
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:15,650
It's nothing to be ashamed about

194
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't let this scar be for naught

195
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:26,953
Walk with a smile

196
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:42,593
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

197
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:48,016
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

198
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:53,062
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

199
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:58,234
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

200
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,406
Everyone makes mistakes

201
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:08,619
It's nothing to be ashamed about

202
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't let this scar be for naught

203
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,213
Walk with a smile

204
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:24,510
Transform sadness into the wind

205
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:29,807
and continue to forge on

206
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,396
Forge on strong

207
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:51,662
Hey Yashamaru,
what does pain feel like?

208
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,832
I don't know because
I've never been injured...

209
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,502
I was wondering what it's like.

210
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,881
Could it be that I'm hurt?

211
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,886
I'm not bleeding, but my chest's
felt weird for a long time.

212
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:11,432
It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!

213
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:14,227
Next time:
"Assassin of the Moonlit Night"
