1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:36,430
The End of Tears

21
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,781
By special...

22
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,285
By special, you meant that?!

23
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,709
I don't feel like I'm gonna lose.

24
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,598
Sasuke...you...

25
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,945
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,

26
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,031
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.

27
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,866
When they have entirely eaten you...

28
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,746
you will lose yourself...forever.

29
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,334
This body...

30
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,672
It looks like there's no time to waste.

31
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,101
I don't have any feeling in my left arm...

32
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,231
That power you have...

33
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,361
seems to involve some risks too, huh?

34
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,075
Did you know...?

35
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,000
That this place...

36
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,294
is called the Final Valley.

37
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:02,594
I think this is the perfect stage,
don't you think...Naruto?

38
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,939
Oh yeah...

39
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,027
I said there'd be
no more talking, didn't I?

40
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,698
Well, in that case,
how about we bring it to a close...?

41
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,700
This battle.

42
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,287
All our battles up to now!

43
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,375
Next for Squad Seven. Naruto Uzumaki!

44
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,461
Sakura Haruno!

45
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,589
Yipeee!

46
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,841
With Naruto...?

47
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,426
And Sasuke Uchiha.

48
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,595
Yipeee!

49
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,680
With Sasuke...?

50
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,601
Try not to slow me down, loser.

51
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,853
You...!

52
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,940
But...but...but...you told us...

53
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,567
That's why they.....

54
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,570
Aren't we a three-man squad?

55
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,283
That's right! We three are one!

56
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,951
Hey!

57
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,749
Are you hurt? Scaredy Cat?

58
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:22,091
Hey...are you hurt? Scaredy Cat?

59
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,220
You are one of the ones I want to fight.

60
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,890
Sasuke!

61
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,896
I want...to fight you, too.

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,942
I don't want to see any more deaths

63
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,113
of my precious comrades.

64
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,656
Summoning Jutsu!

65
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:56,166
I...will protect Sakura!

66
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,835
What's so funny?

67
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,630
Nothing's funny, believe it! I'm happy!

68
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,634
When I think I can finally beat you here!

69
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,596
What did you say?!
Don't talk foolish, you failure!

70
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,559
I'm not going to be a failure forever!

71
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,144
Just bring it, now!

72
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,438
Put on your headband before that!
I'll wait.

73
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,524
I don't need such a thing...

74
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,734
Just do it!

75
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:29,700
You wouldn't even be able
to put one wound on my forehead!

76
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,618
You're wrong!

77
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,579
I'm saying this is a testament

78
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,290
to fighting on equal terms
as a Leaf Shinobi!

79
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,250
Naruto!

80
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,210
Sasuke!

81
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,129
I'll win no matter what!

82
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,173
Don't flatter yourself!

83
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,633
Stop it!

84
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,307
And from this time onward...

85
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,029
Chidori!

86
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,625
Rasengan!

87
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,863
-Rasengan!
-Chidori!

88
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,344
-Chidori!
-Rasengan!

89
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,792
This Chakra...

90
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,169
This isn't good!

91
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,911
Naruto...

92
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,091
I...

93
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,158
It's started to rain!
Will it erase the scent?

94
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,411
No problem.

95
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,288
We're already close. This way.

96
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,635
Was I too late...?

97
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,520
Naruto!

98
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,527
Why did things come to this?!

99
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,581
This is Sasuke's...

100
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,208
I didn't make it in time...
please forgive me.

101
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,715
Naruto...

102
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,802
I know the kind of person you are...

103
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,554
You must have made a desperate effort.

104
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,479
Sasuke...

105
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,797
That's my boy...

106
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,480
With me, you're all
your father talks about...

107
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,984
You are my one and only brother.

108
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,486
I will continue to be for you...

109
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,739
a wall that you must find
a way to cross over.

110
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,617
Even if you were to hate me...

111
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,788
You are someone

112
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,625
who can obtain Mangekyo Sharingan
just like me...

113
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,089
However, on one condition.

114
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,806
Your closest friend...

115
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,029
The Final Valley...

116
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,491
To think that Sasuke and Naruto
would battle it out here...

117
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,413
How ironic...

118
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,125
Yeah...

119
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,214
When I look at the flow of this water,

120
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:16,262
it's as if I'm being confronted
by an eternal, never-ending battle...

121
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,102
Just like the fate of the two people
depicted in these statues here

122
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,563
who founded the Village Hidden
in the Leaves...

123
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,112
Naruto and Sasuke,

124
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,617
as long as you both live...

125
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,513
You have to kill...

126
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,226
your closest friend!

127
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,033
I'm not gonna...

128
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,121
abide by everything you say!

129
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,507
I will get my hands on power
doing it my own way!

130
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,804
I will surpass you doing it my own way!

131
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,473
Without fail!

132
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,282
The rain's...let up, hasn't it?

133
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,701
Yeah.

134
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,093
With that much rain,

135
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,471
I won't be able to pursue
the scent anymore.

136
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,184
Naruto is more important now
than pursuing Sasuke.

137
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,145
Yeah.

138
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,673
It's gotten interesting, hasn't it?

139
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,342
Yeah...

140
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,400
When I recalled the parts one by one,

141
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,781
I felt as though
I had understood everything

142
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,411
Faded words

143
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:33,126
which I kept so close to me

144
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,423
Speechless nights,

145
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,385
a hint of warmth,

146
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:49,183
and this distant yearning for you

147
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,103
I live,

148
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:57,984
simply repeating this cycle

149
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:07,160
Held in my two hands

150
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,163
A droplet of time

151
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,754
Softly clutching forgotten memories

152
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

153
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,186
I'll keep these thoughts...

154
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Sakura.

155
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:46,991
I made a once-in-a-lifetime promise
that I would bring Sasuke back.

156
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,120
But, I'm not finished yet!

157
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,997
I'll fulfill my promise, no matter what!

158
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,041
Since that was what I was always saying...

159
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,959
that I won't go back on my word.

160
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,463
That's my Way of Ninja!

161
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,007
