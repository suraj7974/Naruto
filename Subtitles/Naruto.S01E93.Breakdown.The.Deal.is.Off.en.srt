1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,307
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,064
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,651
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,279
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,491
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,252
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:50,134
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,260
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,782
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

17
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,588
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,942
How is that your answer... Princess Tsunade?

22
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,654
To think you'd try to kill me...

23
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,451
At any rate,
I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.

24
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:04,083
A trust for your loyalty and your eyes
that spotted Tsunade's attack.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,794
Yes. We're both from
the same medical corps so...

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,589
Her Chakra was overflowing
with violent intent.

27
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:19,765
Tsunade... I was really planning
on resurrecting those two people.

28
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,728
And here I went so far as to promise
not to smash the Leaf Village...

29
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,156
Orochimaru...

30
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:42,872
I know that your promise of
"not touching the village" was a lie...

31
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,960
Even though I knew that...I...

32
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,427
Just one more time would've been fine...

33
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,222
Just one more time, I wanted to see them...

34
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,728
Just one more time...
I wanted to touch them...

35
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:12,318
Just one more time...
To see those smiling faces...

36
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,153
But...

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,366
the moment I felt that rush in my bones...

38
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,371
that I'd be able to see Nawaki
and Dan shortly...

39
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,960
I realized that I'm a hopeless fool!

40
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:38,886
Just by remembering those faces...

41
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,848
I become this blinded.

42
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,017
Big sister!

43
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,810
Tsunade...

44
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,982
I loved them... I truly loved them!

45
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,611
So, I wanted to see them
and hug them in my arms!

46
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,704
But...I couldn't...

47
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,668
I won't lose the bet, no matter what!

48
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,673
Because of that kid...
I remembered the dreams of the two.

49
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,134
Here I was trying to forget...

50
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,805
This village is grandfather's treasure!

51
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,140
I'm going to protect it!

52
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,601
'Cuz I'm the grandson of the First Hokage

53
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,062
who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!

54
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,608
I love this village and my comrades...

55
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,111
So I want to protect them.

56
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,032
Right! Someday,
I'll become just like Grandfather.

57
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,660
And the Hokage name will be mine!

58
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:51,917
Unlike you... I will be the heir to
the Hokage name, no matter what!

59
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,965
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,676
So I'll become the Hokage...

61
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,387
An existence that protects everyone...

62
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,688
-Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
-Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

63
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,944
The precious dreams that
they risked their lives for...

64
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,656
Making those dreams come true
was also my desire...

65
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,873
Things that have formed
eventually decay... You said that.

66
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:40,966
But...

67
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,765
after all, these are feelings
that won't decay...

68
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,690
So our negotiations have broken down...
It can't be helped.

69
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,153
Since it's come to this, I have no choice
but to ask forcibly.

70
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,581
Breakdown! The Deal is Off!

71
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,973
Come! Orochimaru!

72
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,522
Come to think of it, we've never gone
at it even once until now.

73
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,777
That's right!

74
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,945
What're you saying?

75
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,696
I'm the one who has
to go at it with her, right?

76
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,409
Now I'm going to kill
you two worthless punks...here!

77
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,622
Incredible strength as usual...

78
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,166
It'll be over if you're hit once.

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,752
I can see that...

80
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,008
It's a bit cramped here
for fighting at a distance.

81
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,718
Are you going to change the location?

82
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,846
That would probably be better...

83
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,892
There was another troublesome person
with the Lady Tsunade's attendant.

84
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,728
That person may come to her aid.

85
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,023
You're going down!

86
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,362
Who is...the troublesome person?

87
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,157
One of Sannin,
the same as you and Lady Tsunade...

88
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,620
Jiraiya!

89
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,506
I won't let you get away, no matter what!

90
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,681
Wh-What's this?!

91
00:07:56,143 --> 00:08:00,647
Princess Tsunade tore it up... big time.

92
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,068
This means that Lady Tsunade refused...

93
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,198
Where did old Tsunade go?

94
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,580
That belongs to Lady Tsunade...!

95
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,044
Tonton... Which way?

96
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,130
Okay!

97
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,860
It looks like you're quite
out of breath, too... Tsunade.

98
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,655
It's just about time.

99
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,993
I'm not that great at Taijutsu, but...

100
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,959
A Food Pill!

101
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,426
That Sign...!

102
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,058
This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu...

103
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,586
He got my muscle...!

104
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,214
I severed, ever so slightly,

105
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,759
the bicep muscle of your upper arm
and the rectus muscle of your thigh.

106
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,554
Now you won't be able to release
your incredible strength.

107
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,309
A Chakra scalpel, eh...
Why don't you target the arteries?

108
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,936
Indeed, with this scalpel,

109
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,607
I could cut the muscles and vessels
without external injury.

110
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,234
But as may be expected,

111
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,778
I can't make a long, delicate scalpel
in the middle of battle

112
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,823
that can reach the arteries
and the heart muscle.

113
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,492
But, even so...

114
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,288
there'd be no problem at all
if I target the opponent's neck!

115
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:34,551
Dang it! My intercostals got hit.
My breathing...

116
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,513
He's no ordinary Medical Ninja.

117
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,518
His Jutsu sense and his edge
exceed even me in my heyday!

118
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,398
It would still be trouble
if you were to die on me.

119
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,233
I won't target your vital spot...

120
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,737
But with this, you can't move anymore...

121
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,170
She's amazing...

122
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,673
Ordinarily, one wouldn't be able
to budge due to difficulty breathing.

123
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:20,806
It looks like it will be necessary
to rough her up a little more...

124
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,768
but not enough to kill her.

125
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,195
Even though I'm trying to move my hand...

126
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,615
my leg moves?!

127
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,244
D-Don't tell me! This is...

128
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,997
You little!

129
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,880
In my present condition,

130
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,425
this seems to be the extent of my power...

131
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,057
I see...

132
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:11,523
It's... It's not the muscles...
It's the nerves!

133
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:17,779
It seems you've realized...
That's right. It's the nerves!

134
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,032
I changed Chakra into electricity...

135
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:25,745
made an electrical field and
poured electricity into your nerves.

136
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,291
The communication between
the brain and the body

137
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,669
is all done with electric signals...

138
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:38,633
Tsunade jumbled up all of
the electric signals that are exchanged

139
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,803
at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.

140
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,975
Having left battle and yet such power...

141
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,561
So this is the legendary Sannin?

142
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,067
Healing-types use too much Chakra...

143
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,528
But in this condition...

144
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
If I try to move my right hand...

145
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,749
my left leg moves.

146
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,252
If I try to move my left ankle...

147
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,964
my right shoulder moves.

148
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,646
It's difficult...

149
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,861
But I've already grasped eighty percent
of what moves when I move what.

150
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,198
Don't mess with me...

151
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,574
with this low-level...

152
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,995
Jutsu!

153
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,873
What?! In only a moment,
his body movements...

154
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,626
You're scared of blood, aren't you?!

155
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,587
I'll show you plenty from now!

156
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,321
Jiraiya...?

157
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,576
It's been a long time... Jiraiya.

158
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,745
Orochimaru...

159
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,543
You've got an evil look as usual.

160
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,302
Huh?! K-Kabuto?

161
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,013
Naruto...

162
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,644
I see... So you know each other?

163
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,398
We took the Chunin Exam together!

164
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,068
Why are you here, Kabuto...?

165
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,197
-Get out of the way!
-Hey...

166
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,950
I'll take... these guys!

167
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,165
Just because you've mastered
your body movements...

168
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,792
it doesn't mean...

169
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,961
you can move like normal!

170
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,299
I won't let you get away now!

171
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,217
Too late!

172
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,608
My body movements have finally returned...

173
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,860
Blood...!

174
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:51,034
Having two of the legendary Sannin
as opponents is hairy, isn't it...?

175
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,204
So even if it's just one... I'll stop you!

176
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,749
Lady Tsunade!

177
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,630
Say! Say! What's happening?!

178
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,341
Why's Kabuto fighting with old Tsunade?!

179
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:11,137
You're slow, Naruto...

180
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,308
That's why you're no match for Sasuke.

181
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,022
Take a good look at the headband!

182
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,484
He's Orochimaru's subordinate.

183
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,194
Wha...?!

184
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,657
That's right... I was a spy from
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

185
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,038
Wh-What're you saying?

186
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,124
You're lying, right, Kabuto?

187
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,587
During the Chunin Exam
you taught us a lot...

188
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,131
And you also saved us.

189
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:51,845
Well, I wanted to gather data on you guys.

190
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:57,308
Naruto, there's something
I understood by gathering your data.

191
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,230
You have no Ninja ability.

192
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,151
Unlike Sasuke!

193
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,458
It's the first time
I've seen Lady Tsunade like this...

194
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,472
Please don't push it too far alone.

195
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,518
I'm your attendant, so...

196
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,772
Old Lady Tsunade...

197
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,358
Even with a fierce look,

198
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,820
you're just a cute Genin
who's a fish out of water.

199
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,785
Admittedly, I was anticipating
the monster dwelling inside you...

200
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,038
But now,
with the legendary Sannin before me,

201
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,247
you leave something to be desired.

202
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,213
You're just a puny zero. So if you meddle...

203
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,175
I'll kill you.

204
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,678
You little!

205
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,472
Don't, Naruto!

206
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,933
My body's still...

207
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,644
That hand...

208
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,146
He shouldn't be able to use
that right hand anymore.

209
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,025
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

210
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,486
I'll attack at once with four...

211
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,073
and break him from the right side
where he can't defend!

212
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,995
You little!

213
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,288
Okay!

214
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,999
What?

215
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,169
Blood?

216
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,979
Poison Needles!

217
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,731
My neural reflexes still haven't
completely returned!

218
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,733
I can't dodge completely!

219
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,947
With the headband...!

220
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,200
Good job, acting so quickly...

221
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,415
Thanks, Shizune!

222
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,340
That's...

223
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,262
A Plasma Pill!

224
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,264
A Plasma Pill?

225
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,606
So he's trying to replenish
lost blood, huh...

226
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,610
That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me...

227
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,572
The blood is gushing out nicely,
eh, Kabuto?

228
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,241
Lord Orochimaru...

229
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,785
Please take off the bandage
on your left arm.

230
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,469
That man is Orochimaru...

231
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,014
At last, the real thing appears...

232
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,017
Shizune!

233
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,393
Y-Yes!

234
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,647
You take care of...
that guy with the glasses!

235
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,321
I'll take care of Orochimaru!

236
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,519
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

237
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

238
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,821
On your still shoulder

239
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,492
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

240
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

241
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

242
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,507
"Each one of us

243
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,512
glows differently,"

244
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,348
you say laughingly

245
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:53,688
but you look most dazzling

246
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,234
Like a comet,

247
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:04,157
like the rainbow after the storm

248
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,870
You bring light

249
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,372
into my heart

250
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:16,878
Being lost

251
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:22,467
can be the answer

252
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:28,306
Let's promise

253
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,017
we won't cheat

254
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,937
Uh...like a shooting star, we do go ahead.

255
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,401
Enough already, you traitor!

256
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,238
Don't you dare touch
Old Lady Tsunade again!

257
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,949
Hey Old Lady, just like our wager

258
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,786
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you!

259
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,581
I won't run away! I won't give up!

260
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:58,419
Just watch. This is my Way of Ninja!

261
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,881
Next time: "Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!"
