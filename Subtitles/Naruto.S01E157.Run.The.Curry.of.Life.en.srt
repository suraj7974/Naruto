1
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,305
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:36,096
Run! The Curry of Life

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,409
Why...do you go that far...?

17
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,874
I'll get so strong that Guy Sensei
can look at me with a smile...

18
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,043
That is my Way of Ninja!

19
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,462
I see...

20
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,801
So you live for the sake
of Guy or whatever...

21
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,723
Then have that Guy person
give you a funeral!

22
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:24,019
I'm sure he'll think of your hard work
and cry for you!

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,197
Ninja Art...

24
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,789
Thunder Dragon Tornado!

25
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,093
One, two!

26
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:00,389
Mom, don't push!
I can't run that fast!

27
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,894
Oh my, this isn't the time
for complaining!

28
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,833
Please, hurry!

29
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,003
I'll go on ahead, okay?!

30
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,630
Oh my!

31
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:44,433
Where'd he disappear to...?
Has he evaporated to the bone...?

32
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,868
Hey! Hang in there!

33
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,996
One, two...!

34
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,958
One, two...!

35
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,960
I've had it...

36
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,171
Grandma Sansho, the curry of life!

37
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,631
One...

38
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,301
Two!

39
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,179
I'll look after Lee.

40
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,433
So give Neji and Naruto
some curry!

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,480
Ranmaru, wait here.

42
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,190
Right.

43
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,319
I'm going to Naruto!
Please look after Lee.

44
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,536
You too, get your butt to Neji!

45
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,662
Oh... right, Mom.

46
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,002
Right... Open Lee's mouth.

47
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,254
Oh, right!

48
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,009
Here!

49
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,358
So even the curry of life
won't work, huh...?

50
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,865
Oh my!

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,493
Oh my...

52
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,540
You little...! This isn't the time
to be passing out!

53
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,668
Hot!

54
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,295
What're you doing, believe it?!

55
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,629
Are you awake?

56
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:41,675
Oh, Tenten?
Didn't you fall off the cliff?!

57
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,429
You should've realized
that was his trap!

58
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,391
What?! I was totally snow-jobbed,
believe it!

59
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,102
Neji, Neji!

60
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,859
It's the curry of life!
Eat this and get better.

61
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,489
Neji?!

62
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,783
Neji!

63
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,880
Oh my, thank goodness he got better!

64
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,964
What?

65
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,811
The world is spinning...

66
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,522
He's acting kind of strange...

67
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,773
Oh my...

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,484
One, two...

69
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,863
Put the curry of life in this,
pot and all.

70
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,115
Okay.

71
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,120
Hot!

72
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,663
Oww!

73
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,503
Oh! The curry...

74
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,175
This is bad!

75
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,181
Don't worry about it. Move it!

76
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,434
On account of that wine...

77
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,812
Will he be okay?

78
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,651
Oh my, there's a slight problem
with the ingredients...

79
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,821
But there shouldn't be
much difference in efficacy.

80
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,698
But...

81
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,045
Oh my...!

82
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,090
He's coming this way.

83
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,718
It's okay! I'll go...

84
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:01,732
You're still alive?!
I have to finish you off...

85
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,983
Raiga...

86
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,823
You're alive, Ranmaru?!

87
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,242
It's Ranmaru!

88
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,997
That kid gave Raiga his own Chakra
and brought him back to life...

89
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,290
What?!

90
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,751
Raiga looked at Ranmaru
who was unconscious

91
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,879
and assumed he was dead...

92
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,049
So that's why he was saying
all that gibberish

93
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,551
about Ranmaru watching
from high above.

94
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,765
And I managed to get Ranmaru
to the Curry of Life Shop.

95
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,184
So that's what happened...

96
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,396
We'll again be together forever,
Ranmaru...

97
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,651
Let's kill them and have fun
doing lots of bad things.

98
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,111
Right, Raiga...

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,499
Some fog has appeared.

100
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,420
It's okay.
I'll be your eyes again, Raiga...

101
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:11,176
Right. There's nothing to be afraid of
if I'm with you, Ranmaru.

102
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,971
Now, let's go, Raiga!

103
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,889
What about them?

104
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,685
They're dead now...

105
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:25,023
Right...Shall we search
for our next prey?

106
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,323
But there's a precipitous cliff ahead!

107
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,702
That Ranmaru, what's he going to do?!

108
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,329
Could it be...

109
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,625
he's going to atone for the past sins
together with Raiga?!

110
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,921
He might be planning to lead Raiga
over that cliff and die together!

111
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,506
Wh-What?!

112
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,431
What's with you, jerk?!

113
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,684
What?!

114
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,984
Lee...

115
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,662
Hey...

116
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:36,386
Here I go...!

117
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,353
What?!

118
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,524
You...brat!

119
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,156
He suddenly recovered!

120
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,920
Knock it off!

121
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,816
He's fast!

122
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,829
You okay, Ranmaru?

123
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,250
You stay here!

124
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,918
Take me with you...

125
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,633
Oh! Ranmaru!

126
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,637
Where'd you go, Ranmaru?!

127
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,898
You little...! You're going to pay for this!

128
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,946
Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!

129
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,492
Now...

130
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,080
Bring it!

131
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,123
Knock it off!

132
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,292
Here I go...

133
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,271
That was a heck of a blow.

134
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:57,110
If I hadn't put on the Thunder Armor;
I'd be giving myself a funeral.

135
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:08,872
In order to remember your hard work
I'll give you your funeral myself!

136
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,290
Wait!

137
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,634
What's the idea...?

138
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:27,140
I want to feed you...
the curry of life, too.

139
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,350
Huh?!

140
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,521
You'll realize that you're not alone
if you eat the curry...

141
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,482
Everyone's feelings are blended in...

142
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,359
What're you saying?!

143
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,154
Let's stop hurting people...

144
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,156
Cut it out!

145
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,243
You're my eyes and ears!

146
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,623
We'll no longer be two people in one
if you say such selfish things!

147
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,668
Shoot your lightning...

148
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,588
If I die, the strong Raiga will also die...

149
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,341
We're two in one, so...

150
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,934
I...won't be able to remember you
from when you were cool...

151
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,396
I must give you a funeral!

152
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,031
Stop...Raiga!

153
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,701
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

154
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,545
There are lots of Narutos...

155
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,467
Did I get drunk?

156
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,563
You little...! It makes no difference,
no matter how many of you there are!

157
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,691
Neji, wake up!

158
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,237
What're you doing, Neji?

159
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,369
Eat this and get it together!
We've got trouble here!

160
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,746
That's...

161
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,295
What?!

162
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,130
Now we've done it...

163
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:27,594
You're going to kill by your own hand
the friend who risked his life to save you?!

164
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,680
Wha...?! Ranmaru betrayed me...

165
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,809
He broke the promise for it
to be just us two forever!

166
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,188
He's not all alone anymore!

167
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,565
He figured out that it's more fun...

168
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:45,904
to laugh with everyone
than to cry with you!

169
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,447
Naruto...

170
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,909
Ranmaru, you were going to die
with Raiga, weren't you?!

171
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,037
Don't be thinking about
something like that anymore!

172
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,373
You're free now!

173
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,502
Don't worry. I won't let Raiga
give you a funeral, no matter what!

174
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,964
Hey, don't be shooting off your mouth,
you shrimp.

175
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,466
Say what?!

176
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,888
Don't underestimate me.
I'm Raiga Kurosuki!

177
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,935
I've been counted before as one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

178
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,688
I won't take orders from
the likes of you!

179
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,024
Oh. That's right.
He's a Ninja Swordsman, huh?

180
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,985
If you're one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,

181
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,154
then I've got something to ask you.

182
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,408
You know the guy called Kisame, right?!

183
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,705
Kisame? I hate that guy!

184
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,917
So I'll give him a funeral for sure
the next time I see him!

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,043
What?!

186
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,128
I hate him.

187
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,841
I hate all the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist!

188
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,222
Ranmaru. You're the only one
who's a friend to me...

189
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,687
But Ranmaru...
you've made other friends...

190
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,526
We're not two in one anymore...

191
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,821
Raiga...

192
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,163
Impudent!

193
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,837
Who do you think taught you
about the outside world?!

194
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,967
It's a funeral for you!

195
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,458
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

196
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,169
You little...

197
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,006
Clone... Body Slam!

198
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,101
Ranmaru...

199
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,609
Now you're free...

200
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,153
Raiga?!

201
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:41,037
Thunder! Give me my funeral!

202
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,155
One, two... One...

203
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,575
Not loud enough!

204
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,452
– You can't make genuine curry of life...
– One, two...

205
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,746
– if you don't stir it with all your heart!
– One, two...

206
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,623
Oh my!

207
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,627
Ouch... What're you doing, Mom?!

208
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,046
Oh my, Karashi!

209
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,843
It's a hundred years too soon for you
to be uttering the word "genuine"!

210
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,055
You too, start your training over again
from the beginning!

211
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,016
What?!

212
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,183
Grandma Sansho!

213
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,312
We'll be leaving now!

214
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,188
Thanks for your help.

215
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,816
I leave Ranmaru to you!

216
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,321
Oh my... I'll train him mercilessly
as a successor...

217
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,781
to the preparation of the curry of life!

218
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,369
Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.

219
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,787
– Thanks!
– Thanks!

220
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,040
Oh my...

221
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,502
It's a long way
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.

222
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,963
I made you guys some special curry

223
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,758
that'll give you guys ten thousand times
the strength.

224
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,052
Be on your way after having some.

225
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,976
What's this very spicy-looking
bright red color...?

226
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,604
It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!

227
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,273
Oh! That looks good!

228
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,400
– What? Seriously?!
– What? Seriously?!

229
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,571
Lady Tsunade will get mad at us
if we don't get back soon!

230
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,448
You're right!

231
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,660
Unfortunately, we'll have to be going now.

232
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,870
Wait!

233
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,337
Oh my, those kids were sure
diffident and reserved...

234
00:20:56,214 --> 00:21:00,843
The curry... The curry...!

235
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,740
So many things happen

236
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:28,371
on this endless road, huh?

237
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:34,085
Although you're strong-willed,

238
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

239
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,470
What dreams

240
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:51,144
did you chase to get here?

241
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,774
Even I have times when

242
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

243
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,911
When you're sad,

244
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:14,709
I'll be close to you

245
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:20,882
Even on nights when we're apart,

246
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

247
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,934
I'll be close to you

248
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,108
One's duty as team captain:

249
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,027
"Issue appropriate instructions
to the subordinates,

250
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,155
protect the lives of your men and
promptly carry out your mission."

251
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,075
Awesome, that is so cool!

252
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,913
This is so perfect for me, Naruto, the man
who will eventually become a Hokage!

253
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,584
All right, I'll use this to instantly get
closer to the title of Hokage, believe it!

254
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:01,547
Next time: "Follow My Lead!
The Great Survival Challenge!"
