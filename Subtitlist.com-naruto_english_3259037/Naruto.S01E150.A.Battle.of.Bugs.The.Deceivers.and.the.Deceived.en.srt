1
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,933
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,479
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,612
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,992
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:39,165
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,837
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,078
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,378
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,930
A Battle of Bugs!
The Deceivers and the Deceived!

21
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,226
What the heck is happening...?

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,895
Why does Hinata have to be kidnapped?!

23
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,525
Why are there guys who know
that we're searching for Bikochu?!

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,821
We were being watched all this time.
Ever since we arrived...

25
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,823
You were aware of that?!

26
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,075
You're the only one who didn't know.

27
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,661
Why didn't you tell me?!

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,539
Because if we told you,
you'd have raised a big fuss!

29
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,708
And the insects would flee!
All the insects...!

30
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,252
Including the Bikochu!

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,843
If they tried to steal the Bikochu
from us through force,

32
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,053
the insects would be in danger
of getting hurt.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,432
So they captured Hinata and
decided to go with a hostage exchange.

34
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,351
That's very smart of them.

35
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,021
Something smells sweet...

36
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,273
It's the smell of honey.

37
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,025
Bee's honey...
Bees...?

38
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,197
Hinata's scent ends here...

39
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,283
In that case...

40
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,168
Those guys waited for a moment when
Hinata was alone

41
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,337
and attacked her using bees.

42
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,757
I've heard that in the Hidden Stone Village
in the Land of Earth,

43
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,303
there's a clan of insect handlers
who primarily use bees.

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,973
The name of that clan is...
the Kamizuru Clan.

45
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,310
Kamizuru...? That's a name
that isn't heard very often.

46
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,981
Seems they were once hailed as being
at a level equal to the Aburame Clan...

47
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,774
But they aren't anymore?

48
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,485
This is a story from
the times of my grandfather...

49
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,699
There was a time when the Shinobi
of the Hidden Stone Village

50
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,159
were going to invade the Leaf Village...

51
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,039
The Kamizuru Clan was designated
to spearhead the operation...

52
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,375
The plan was to create
a disruption by releasing

53
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,462
a large swarm of bees into the village
followed by an invading main unit...

54
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,716
However, the Aburame Clan wised up to that

55
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,426
and prepared to engage the enemy
in the forest to the west!

56
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,064
This battle between insect handlers
which had no precedent in history...

57
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,483
ended in the Aburame's victory...

58
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,532
With this battle as the turning point,

59
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,409
the Aburame Clan rose to
unchallenged status

60
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,578
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

61
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,373
On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan
was subjected to cold treatment

62
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,416
even in their own village.

63
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:14,213
I've heard that only a few of them
remain now...

64
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,425
So those people came here
to capture Bikochu, huh?

65
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,304
What the heck are those guys
planning to do with the Bikochu?

66
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,435
If my insects come back
we might be able to learn something...

67
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,641
I see... I've been captured...

68
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,771
The Village Hidden in the Leaves is
in a difficult situation right now...

69
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,232
Because of that incident
at the recent Chunin exam?

70
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,319
The Hokage was assassinated,
and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.

71
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,159
Times are about to change dramatically...

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,495
This is a chance for us,
the Kamizuru Clan,

73
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,122
to distinguish ourselves.

74
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,875
But to do that...

75
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,626
The founder's Book of Secrets, huh?

76
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,921
A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu
for Insect Handlers

77
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,799
are apparently inscribed therein
among other things...

78
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,886
If we possessed that at the time of
the battle with the Aburame Clan,

79
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,805
we wouldn't have lost...

80
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,225
However, Clan members have continued
to search for it for many years,

81
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,019
but couldn't find it.

82
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,230
Do you really think
we can find it after all this time?

83
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,483
That's why we need the Bikochu ...

84
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,906
I brought the keepsakes
of the founder, my grandfather, with me...

85
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,203
When the Bikochu emerges,
it will pursue the scent it recognizes.

86
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,663
And we should be able
to locate the Book of Secrets

87
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,541
that Grandfather hid just as he was dying.

88
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,670
This strand of his hair
will surely lead us to it.

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,048
If we get our hands on the Book of Secrets

90
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,592
and if we engage in some big action...

91
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,429
I am certain that... the people of
the village will also acknowledge us.

92
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,477
Those people are also desperately
seeking recognition.

93
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,313
Naruto...

94
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,916
Did you find out anything?
How about Hinata's whereabouts?

95
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,629
No... The other insects were probably
also done in by those guys.

96
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,175
Damn! Then our only choice
is to do what they want?

97
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,137
When I went to all that
trouble of finding it...

98
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,848
So you want to desert Hinata?

99
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,976
H-How could anyone possibly do that?!

100
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,562
I won't desert her no matter
what might happen!

101
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,273
Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!

102
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,358
Exactly.

103
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,530
But then we'd be able to locate Sasuke
if we have this guy here...

104
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,034
Well, I guess we'll have to think of
some other method of finding Sasuke.

105
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,746
Yeah... Right now, the first thing
we need to do is rescue Hinata.

106
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,792
But, do you think Hinata
would be satisfied with that?

107
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,297
The person who originally
thought up this plan was Hinata.

108
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,506
Huh? But...

109
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,218
It's true that I told her about
the existence of Bikochu...

110
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,973
However...

111
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,435
The odds of finding
a Bikochu are extremely low...

112
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,896
We thought that she should aspire
to an important mission

113
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:04,026
with an assured outcome for the village,
rather than a mission with such low odds.

114
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,656
But Hinata didn't give up.

115
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,786
She argued persistently that
if there was even a small possibility,

116
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,705
one should take on the challenge.

117
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,667
Th-That Hinata did...?

118
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:27,382
She was extremely forceful and
Shino and I had no choice but to agree.

119
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,304
It's the first time Hinata
ever volunteered for a mission.

120
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,058
For that reason too,
I want to make this a success.

121
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,559
Yeah.

122
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:41,605
But when we don't know
where Hinata is, how are we...?

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,484
There is one place where Hinata
will definitely make an appearance.

124
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,529
I see! The place where...

125
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,990
...the exchange with
the Bikochu takes place!

126
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,661
We will definitely have
a chance at that time.

127
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,164
All right!
We will recover Hinata without fail...

128
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,084
and we will also protect
the Bikochu to the very end!

129
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,805
We brought the Bikochu! Return Hinata!

130
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,269
Place the insect cage
on that rock over there!

131
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:21,979
Hinata!

132
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,982
Release Hinata!

133
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,442
I must verify it first!

134
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,331
What's...the meaning of this?!

135
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,169
Are you trying to make a mockery
of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!

136
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,591
A goliath beetle... You gotta be kidding!

137
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,385
Now, Shino!

138
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,470
What?!
Parasitic Insects!

139
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,474
Heh! Recovery successful!

140
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,436
All right!

141
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,897
Damn!

142
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,986
Naruto!
All right, resign yourselves!

143
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,242
Your time's up!

144
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,456
What's this?

145
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,795
This one doesn't smell like Hinata!

146
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,339
Huh?!

147
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,383
Just as I thought...

148
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,762
Beeswax...?

149
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,806
There they come!

150
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,519
Damn! You jerk! You jerk!

151
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,565
Damn! All these things are honey...?!

152
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,110
Sorry, Naruto... But these damn bees!

153
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,528
There's no end to them!

154
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,489
Do we need to slash them
if they're honey?!

155
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,202
You two don't move from there!

156
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,953
Huh?

157
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,582
This is the genuine thing!
And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.

158
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,835
It appears that genuine ones are mixed in...

159
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,338
But they're indistinguishable
from each other!

160
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,048
Back me up for a little!

161
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,758
Wall of Insects Jutsu!

162
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,353
A-Awesome...

163
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,529
Amazing power for a Genin...

164
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,701
As might be expected from
the Aburame Clan...I guess.

165
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,870
The Kamizuru Clan...

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,833
Huh...? So you were aware of that fact.

167
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,793
Return Hinata!

168
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,504
Of course, our intention was
to return her...

169
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,258
But only if you calmly hand over
the Bikochu.

170
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,468
However...

171
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,637
It looks like you have
no intention of doing that!

172
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,265
In that case, what do you plan on doing?

173
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,891
If you're an insect handler,

174
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,060
you wouldn't bring a delicate insect
like the Bikochu

175
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,354
to a dangerous place like a battleground...

176
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,482
We'll finish you off right here...

177
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,402
and take our time afterwards
to search for the Bikochu!

178
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,322
Wall of Insects Jutsu!

179
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,243
That one doesn't have
any other tricks, huh!

180
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,249
Shino! Paper Bombs!

181
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,760
Take this!

182
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,763
1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!

183
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,941
Insect Clones...?

184
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,448
Up to your annoying tricks, huh...

185
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,868
Shino! What are we gonna do now?!

186
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,454
Don't you think we should
go back there for a moment?

187
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,332
Those guys might find the Bikochu!

188
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,793
No...that location will definitely be safe.

189
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,672
More importantly, the first thing
we need to do is search for Hinata!

190
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,194
There's no mistake.

191
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,655
Inside here.

192
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,032
Hinata! Where are you?!

193
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,451
Hey! Be careful!

194
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,828
There's no sign of those guys,
but it might be a trap...

195
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,957
Is she there?!

196
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,750
Hinata...?

197
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,051
Hinata!

198
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,680
Are you all right, Hinata?

199
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,184
I'll rescue you in a moment!

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,154
Just a little more!

201
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,995
All right... I got it off!

202
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,162
Naruto...

203
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,208
Thank you!
H-Hinata...?!

204
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,340
H-Hinata...stop that!

205
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,969
What do you think you're doing,
out of the blue like that?!

206
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,847
Who...are you?

207
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,642
What are you talking about, Shino?
That's Hinata.

208
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,604
If you're really Hinata,

209
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,649
you'd get red in the face
and faint if you hugged Naruto.

210
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,817
– Huh?
– Oh!

211
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,696
I see... But Akamaru's nose wouldn't fail...

212
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,617
What? The smell of two people is mingled?

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,994
You're not Hinata?

214
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,957
Naruto... It's me... I'm Hinata, believe me.

215
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,626
In that case...

216
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,420
show us what you tried to stick
on Naruto's back right now!

217
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,967
A Paper Bomb?

218
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,346
So you were intending to blow up Naruto!

219
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,104
I thought that would work...

220
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,565
You are...

221
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,610
I see, the one on the hill
was a clone, huh...

222
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,446
Wearing Hinata's clothes...

223
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,573
That's how she was able
to compromise the smell.

224
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,034
Where is the real Hinata?!

225
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,828
I wonder where she could be?

226
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,837
I see...

227
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,758
Suzumebachi lured the Aburame Clan, huh?

228
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,260
Well, it appears that your comrades...

229
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,972
place more value on the Bikochu
than on you.

230
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,059
There's nobody else coming to rescue you.

231
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,066
Jibachi, Let's search for
the Bikochu that those guys hid!

232
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,986
There's not much time until sunrise!

233
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,156
Right! Don't even try to escape.

234
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,952
If you make even the smallest movement
out of the ordinary,

235
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,870
those bees will cut the string.

236
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,917
Up ahead is the entrance to
a labyrinthine underground water vein...

237
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,297
If you fall in, you'll pass into
the other world in an instant.

238
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,843
We don't wish to kill
anyone unnecessarily.

239
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,305
If you want to live,
I suggest you just stay quiet.

240
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:01,062
How mortifying... I ended up being
a burden to everyone, after all.

241
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,278
You guys are just like summer insects
who fly right into the fire!

242
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,492
If you're lucky, we'll meet again...

243
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,335
That place isn't just an ordinary cave.

244
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,595
Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!

245
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,513
There's nothing else to grab on to.

246
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,266
Be patient until I've checked
the surroundings!

247
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,394
No!

248
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,319
A huge number of bee larvae!

249
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,112
Bee larvae, huh...?

250
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,324
But what's with their unusual huge size?

251
00:17:54,908 --> 00:18:00,163
If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu,
I'll spare your life.

252
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,790
I refuse!

253
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:06,002
Searching for the Bikochu is
the mission that we were given!

254
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,255
Then die!

255
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,717
Paper Bombs!

256
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,011
Damn! Let's go, Akamaru!

257
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,223
Fang Over Fang!

258
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,683
That sound is...

259
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,648
I see... They're still continuing to fight
without giving up.

260
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,526
This is not the time to be crying...

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,571
There's no way that I can give up.
I suggested this whole thing!

262
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,698
Byakugan!

263
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,577
There are 13 bees... attached to the string.

264
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,289
If I can take them all down at once...
I'll be saved.

265
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,585
But, to take down bees that small...

266
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,850
Impossible! This guy...

267
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:10,108
I told you before...
I don't know...when to give up.

268
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,402
Naruto...

269
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,072
Yes... I won't give up either!

270
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,119
I need to concentrate and
control my Chakra...

271
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,495
Fang Over Fang!

272
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,710
How many of them are there...?!

273
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,215
Kiba!

274
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,887
I-I can't muster any strength...
Somehow my body is...

275
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,681
No way!

276
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:46,352
The larvae in this hive's favorite food
is Chakra!

277
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,355
What?!
As long as you're in there,

278
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,525
they'll go through the wall
to suck up the Chakra...

279
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,738
What's the matter...?

280
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,240
So have you decided
to tell me the location?

281
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,716
Now!

282
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,185
Four...Five, six...ten...

283
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,146
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

284
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,856
Damn!

285
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,866
Summoning Jutsu!

286
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,169
Would you like to be the feed
for the larvae...

287
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,339
or would you like to get out of here
and become the prey of this girl here?

288
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,967
Choose whichever you like!

289
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,195
Crappy news pass us by

290
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,532
And you become speechless

291
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,496
My voice is way too soft

292
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,792
So you don't answer

293
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

294
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

295
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

296
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,518
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

297
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,230
Yeah

298
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

299
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,656
Yeah

300
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

301
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,999
Yeah

302
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

303
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:25,178
Yeah

304
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,275
What should I do? My body won't move.

305
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,738
I proposed this mission myself
wanting to help Naruto, and yet...

306
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,448
I don't want to end up as
a burden to everyone anymore,

307
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,784
that's what I aimed for, but ...

308
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,660
No, calm down.

309
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,621
I need to concentrate my Chakra
and remember that training!

310
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:57,126
I have no choice but to do it now!
That is the best I can do right now!

311
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:01,464
Next time: "Blaze Away, Byakugan!
This is My Ninja Way!!"
