1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,381
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,812
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,414
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,106
Special technique!

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,151
Shadow Clone Jutsu, fishing version!

20
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,843
Thrash about more!

21
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,636
I want to catch some for curing!

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,137
Three isn't enough!

23
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,850
Three more, you loser!

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,563
This is very taxing, you know?!

25
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,730
I mean, let's switch!

26
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,232
Sasuke!

27
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,027
The fire's ready to light!
Fireballs please.

28
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,323
I guess three is okay for the time being...

29
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,575
Wha...?

30
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,786
Hey, wait a minute!

31
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,583
The Scroll's Secret:
No Peeking Allowed

32
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,340
It's already been four days
since the second exam started.

33
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,759
Yeah.
That's right.

34
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,722
The start of the second exam
was around three in the afternoon.

35
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,892
We only have twenty-five or
twenty-six hours left.

36
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,812
There may already be
some teams that have passed.

37
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,230
That means...

38
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,734
I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.

39
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,322
We're soon going to be in a hot spot...

40
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,200
That's the biggest one.

41
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,036
Believe it!

42
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,996
Okay...

43
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,250
Even if we were to try pursuit,

44
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,462
there's probably hardly anybody left
to become targets.

45
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,922
What do we do?

46
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,763
Almost everyone's surely already passed.

47
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,807
Yeah. It's already been
four days, after all.

48
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,060
Anyway...

49
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,604
It's early afternoon now...
Let's have a meal.

50
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,111
You two rest a bit and
I'll go find us something to eat.

51
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,328
Say...

52
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,454
Hmm?

53
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,082
As I recall, on the other one...

54
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,543
"Heaven" was written here...

55
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:16,382
and unlike this,
both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?

56
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,802
Umm, when I was shown
the scroll before the exam,

57
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,971
I wasn't really looking.

58
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,307
So, what of it all of a sudden?

59
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,730
Y-You've got to be kidding...?

60
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,825
For all we know...

61
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,328
there may not be any Heaven scrolls.

62
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,998
What do you mean, Sakura?

63
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,166
Well, in this second exam...

64
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,087
four of the five-day
time limit have passed already.

65
00:04:56,005 --> 00:05:00,259
So that means we've already
used eighty percent of the total exam time.

66
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,929
Seventy-eight participants
and twenty-six teams.

67
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,807
There are only thirteen each
of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,644
At most there are only
thirteen passing teams.

69
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,190
Moreover, you remember,
don't you, Sasuke?

70
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,198
That the Orochimaru guy burned
the "Heaven scroll" that we had.

71
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,577
Which means...

72
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,956
The teams that will pass had already,
at that point, decreased by one.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,041
Hmm?

74
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:37,296
Also, all of the other scrolls are
not necessarily safe, so...

75
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,843
After parting ways with
the Leaf Village bunch,

76
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,512
we allotted two days for healing...

77
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,475
So from here on, we have to increase
the distance of our actions.

78
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:55,689
At any rate,
the next enemy is our last chance.

79
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,776
I'm going to get some drinking water.

80
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,666
Say! Say!

81
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,212
I have a good way for us not to fight
with an enemy. Believe it!

82
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,421
What?!

83
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,052
Get serious!

84
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,012
I am serious.

85
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,099
I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.

86
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,103
Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,
for notes...

87
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,314
If we tweak this a little and change it
into exactly like the Heaven scroll...

88
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,775
-H-Hold it!
-Huh?

89
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,695
Even if you did such a thing,
you don't know what's written on the inside!

90
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,281
If the Proctor looked inside
you will be discovered right away!

91
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,366
Idiot!

92
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,827
Generally with things like this,

93
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,620
there's a password or
something written

94
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,832
and you can't get it
unless you have both scrolls.

95
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,542
In other words...

96
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,462
to pass at the tower goal,
we'll surely need a password.

97
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,006
Or something like that.
Believe it!

98
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,676
What difference does it make?

99
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,763
If you don't know the content,
there's no use making a fake!

100
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:17,062
Man, here I was wondering what
you were going to say, looking all big...

101
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,398
You're an idiot who just can't
think through things.

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,400
B-But...

103
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,486
What if we could predict the content...?

104
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,364
This Earth scroll...

105
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,158
You wouldn't...

106
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,328
I'm going to...open this scroll!

107
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,038
No!

108
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,000
You! Have you forgotten
even the rules, you idiot?

109
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,462
We were told not to look inside the scrolls
until arriving at the tower, right?

110
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,507
But, at this rate,
we'll be in a hot spot, right?

111
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,628
There might be a trap or something.

112
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,672
Carefully... Be careful.

113
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,007
Yeah.

114
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,134
I know...

115
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,911
Hey, what's wrong?

116
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,871
Hey!

117
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,964
What's wrong?
What happened?!

118
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
Hey!

119
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,015
Hey!
Answer me!

120
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,470
You'd best not do it.

121
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,896
An enemy?

122
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,114
Man, you're beyond saving...

123
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,492
That was close.

124
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,577
W-We're sorry.

125
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,334
Those who ignored the rules are forced
into the situation of having to retire.

126
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,296
In the previous exam, hypnotism
Jutsu Formula was set up to

127
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,549
get into the eyes of those who looked
at the scroll along the way.

128
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,763
A measure to get them to lie
in the forest until the end of the exam.

129
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,016
By the way...

130
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,227
If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?

131
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,522
What're you doing hanging
around here alone?

132
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,733
It's not that I'm after your scroll.

133
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,402
I didn't think so.

134
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:38,073
If that was your intention...
you could've taken it from Naruto just now.

135
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,077
So you're also after the Heaven scroll?

136
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,161
No.

137
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,455
I already have them both.

138
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,124
See?

139
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,375
What?

140
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,627
Things led to things...

141
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,879
I was hurrying over to
the vicinity of the tower

142
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,714
to wait for my estranged companions.

143
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,300
Now, if you'll excuse me...

144
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,012
Wait!

145
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,684
Fight me.

146
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,774
Lucky!

147
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,027
Fight you, you say?

148
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,404
S-Sasuke.

149
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,697
This idiot-suke.

150
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,449
What are you saying suddenly?

151
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,284
Are you serious?

152
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,872
Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.

153
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,585
Hey, Sasuke!
Kabuto saved us!

154
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,046
Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.

155
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,214
Shut up!

156
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,758
Sasu...ke.

157
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,929
It can't be helped.
I said it before, too.

158
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,391
This is all that can be done
to survive through this forest now.

159
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,853
Hmm...That's a lie.

160
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,939
A lie?

161
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,818
Your heart isn't totally in this
as much as you're saying.

162
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,158
If you could really become
serious about this exam...

163
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,203
Why is it necessary to fight me?

164
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,831
You should jump on me
at my unguarded moment,

165
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,959
without going to
the trouble of announcing it.

166
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,254
That's...a Ninja.

167
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,301
Hmm, that's profound.

168
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,721
I don't dislike that side of you.

169
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,768
So I shall tell you the way you should go.

170
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,730
However...let's talk as we move.

171
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:38,443
The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke
had reached a great distance.

172
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,780
At this rate, we'll be marked
by fierce animals...and enemies.

173
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,496
Humph!

174
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,672
Are there really still enemies around?

175
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,049
Yes, no mistake.

176
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,842
If you think about it a little,
you'll understand.

177
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,681
Do you know the cleverest way
of fighting in battles

178
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,183
in jungles and
expansive forests such as this?

179
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,935
No.

180
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,145
The tower located in the center
of this forest,

181
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,731
the common goal for us test-takers.

182
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,067
That means when the last day
of the test is here...

183
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,656
the area near that tower is
the easiest place to gather scrolls.

184
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,742
Oh, I see.
Ambush, right?

185
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,161
In other words, we go after the scrolls
of the teams

186
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:34,416
that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls
and are setting out for the tower.

187
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,459
That's one-third of the answer.

188
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,544
What?

189
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,505
I mean that you guys are
not the only ones thinking that!

190
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,719
Near the tower, the same badgers
have probably already set traps, so...

191
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,803
I see!

192
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,182
That means there are lots of enemies
lying in wait to engage us.

193
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,312
Heh, having a handicap
gets me pumped, I say!

194
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,855
I'm looking forward to it!

195
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,983
If we just beat them all and
get the Heaven scroll,

196
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,527
we'll all survive the second exam!

197
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,238
No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!

198
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,616
What's the remaining
one-third of the answer?

199
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,828
The collectors who are certain
to appear during an exam of this nature.

200
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,288
Collectors?

201
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,874
In this exam, with the tower
just a stone's throw away,

202
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,710
you definitely can't rest easy...

203
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,504
Those particular conditions
are what create them.

204
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,800
In other words,
those who gather extra scrolls...

205
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,930
as compensation for sparing them
when coming across an unexpected enemy.

206
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,561
Also, those who get information to
proceed favorably through later exams

207
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,857
by providing the lacking scrolls to
comrades sharing the same village.

208
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,403
And those who are thinking of,
under conditions favorable to them,

209
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,491
annihilating the powerful ones who
will probably get through to the third exam.

210
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,454
It goes without saying,
but these guys are quite the big guns

211
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,915
and the worst enemies who
are definitely not conceited.

212
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,501
I see.

213
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,505
I understand the reason
why you appeared before us.

214
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,633
You're scared, too, right?

215
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,635
That's right.

216
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,647
Now then, the tower has finally
come into view.

217
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,315
From here on is the hard part.

218
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,526
All right, let's go!

219
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,237
An enemy already?

220
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,781
There!

221
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,293
Oh, it's just a centipede.

222
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,504
Yikes! It's huge.

223
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,756
All those legs are gross.

224
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:48,967
Naruto.

225
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,051
Huh?

226
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,972
I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and
careless actions from here on.

227
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,056
Huh?

228
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,518
Rushing ahead through a dense forest
making noise like an elephant

229
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,022
is the same as serving notice
in a loud voice that we're coming.

230
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,359
We'd definitely receive
an enthusiastic welcome.

231
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,945
O-Oh, I see.

232
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,742
As long as time allows, we should
go slowly while remaining hidden.

233
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,493
– Yeah.
– Okay.

234
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,578
Sure.

235
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,506
Heh, not bad, everyone.

236
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,808
Oh?

237
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,695
Okay, it's this way.

238
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,384
Is it a trap?

239
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:17,013
Yeah. It'll get intense ahead from here on.

240
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,659
Kabuto!

241
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,664
H-Huh?

242
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,290
That was close, Naruto.

243
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,337
Substitution Jutsu!

244
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,466
I told you, it would get intense ahead
from here on.

245
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,642
I've...had it...

246
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,852
Oh! Sakura!

247
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,146
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?

248
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,066
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.

249
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,778
Here we can see it right
in front of our eyes.

250
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,321
Strange...

251
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,031
No mistake about it.

252
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:22,078
It seems that we're already
within the enthusiastic welcome.

253
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,497
Take a look at that.

254
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,376
Oh, that can't be!

255
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,716
What on earth is going on?

256
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,842
No way!

257
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,760
Is it Genjutsu...?

258
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,470
So it seems.

259
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,931
We were lured in perfectly.

260
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,435
It appears we were
meticulously careful,

261
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,813
and were made to walk around
the same place in a circle.

262
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,524
We're being watched...

263
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,109
Probably.

264
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,903
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and

265
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,280
catch us unprepared
when we're bone-tired.

266
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,533
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.

267
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,245
Then... they'll be coming soon.

268
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,708
They've appeared.

269
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,251
Hah!

270
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,214
This is the perfect handicap.

271
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,311
Hey, can you hear it?

272
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,274
The clear, blue sky

273
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,945
goes on and on

274
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,115
The ocean

275
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:28,246
spans limitlessly

276
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:33,584
Please keep that smile

277
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,963
on your face forever

278
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,427
Or else I'll cry

279
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

280
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,227
It's all ok now.

281
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is inside

282
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,111
this hand

283
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:05,199
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

284
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,787
When you forget what happiness is

285
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

286
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,963
Light is born, and darkness was born

287
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

288
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,509
Harmonia,

289
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:28,056
feel the telepathy

290
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,561
Hey, can you hear it?

291
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,524
What's with these guys?

292
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,526
Crawling out all of a sudden?

293
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,862
Fighting in numbers isn't necessarily
a good thing, you know?

294
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:43,988
Since it's come to this,

295
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,074
it'll be a comparison of
the number of Clone Jutsu.

296
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,702
I can get twice of twice of
twice of twice of your...

297
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,246
Anyway, I'll multiply
to an incredible number!

298
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,791
It doesn't matter if it's
your Genjutsu or whatever.

299
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,877
I'll kick all their butts!

300
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,131
Next episode: "Clone vs. Clone:
Mine are Better than Yours!"
