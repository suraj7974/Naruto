1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,346
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,184
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,228
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,776
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,492
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,912
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,750
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,336
I wake up

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,215
and someday,

13
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,021
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,691
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,028
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,915
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,753
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,088
One more time

23
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,733
Master Jiraiya...I believe in you.

24
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,922
The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!

25
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,202
Well well...

26
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,622
You don't sleep at all?

27
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,376
What do you want?

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,338
I thought I'd crush you now.

29
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,051
If I do that,
there'd be the possibility for me,

30
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,889
after the first battle,
to be able to fight Sasuke.

31
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,893
I know your Sand attack.

32
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,397
I wonder which is faster,
yours or my Sound.

33
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,626
In the full moon...

34
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,256
in the full moon, his blood boils.

35
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,854
W-What the heck...are you?

36
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:25,015
Amazing... So that's his true form?

37
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,770
But...is it okay?
He's a Sound Ninja ...

38
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,525
It's all right.
He's long since served his purpose.

39
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,903
I thought he was a guinea pig
in order to see...

40
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,906
the power of the boy
called Sasuke or something...

41
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,078
Why...is he with the Sand Ninja?

42
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,374
No, that's not necessary anymore...

43
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,837
Actually, I'd already been ordered
to seize Sasuke.

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,381
But I failed...

45
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,217
-What did you say?
-That's right.

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,052
...for the likes of you?

47
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,597
Are you looking to take me on?

48
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:12,563
You willful little brat...
Don't mess around with grown-ups.

49
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:18,944
Don't be so arrogant.
The situation is in my favor.

50
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,705
It's also been found out that
I'm a minion of the Sound.

51
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:36,795
Then...if they find out that you're
having a secret meeting here with me...

52
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,759
the plan to destroy the Leaf Village
and everything will be for naught!

53
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,014
I heard...
that you're Orochimaru's right-hand man.

54
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,560
Being revealed to them and coming
nonchalantly to meet with me...

55
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,437
You must be a fool.

56
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,610
Well...to be exact, my true identity
wasn't found out...

57
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,446
I let them find out.

58
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,243
I wanted to see how far
the Leaf Village would go...

59
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,289
Even after that it wouldn't
be too late to seize Sasuke.

60
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,710
If you guys are going to fail,
we'll back off immediately...

61
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,506
It's a plan that was originally
posed by the Sound, so.

62
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,637
The Sand is invisible until
the last moment.

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,807
This is the will of the Kazekage.

64
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,101
Holy smokes...

65
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,603
That's fine.

66
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,065
This is the carry-out plan from Sound.

67
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,566
Okay.

68
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,031
And please...tell them about
this plan soon.

69
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,699
Yeah.

70
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,827
I know.

71
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,206
Okay, I'll be going.

72
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,792
To think our allied nation,
the Village Hidden in the Sand,

73
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,128
has been already associated
with the Sound...?!

74
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,964
I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.

75
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,715
Oh, by the way...

76
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,970
I'll take care of the clean up.

77
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,890
No, I'll do it...

78
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,601
As the member of Sand Village
of the Land of Wind,

79
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:18,188
I must do what I can for my allies...

80
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,359
Besides...it's just one mouse.

81
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,194
It'll be easy.

82
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,505
Well well, it's Mr. Proctor.

83
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,178
What in the world are you
doing here alone?

84
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,472
It seems I have no choice,
but to fight.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,418
Leaf Style...

86
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,878
Crescent Moon Dance!

87
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,565
I can't pull it out.

88
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,653
This technique is...
the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.

89
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,572
Being able to manage it
at such a young age.

90
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,825
As expected,
this village is full of talented Ninja.

91
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,871
Your talent with a sword is superb.

92
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:03,085
But, a real sword with substance
can be stopped.

93
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:09,049
However...a Wind sword can't
be stopped by anyone.

94
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:21,687
Take that!

95
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,814
That does it!

96
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,574
Nice, nice.

97
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,577
Hey...

98
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,205
This is paradise.

99
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,417
Hey, I said.

100
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,100
Isn't it time for you to turn
this way already?

101
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:06,148
If you join my training,
I'll give you lots of "service."

102
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,817
P-l-e-a-s-e.

103
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,572
So you finally came out...
I was waiting for you.

104
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,826
What?!

105
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,375
Are you making fun of me?

106
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,337
Right back at you.

107
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,547
I'm hungry.

108
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,799
Let's get back to the inn.

109
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,304
Owww, darn it!

110
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,477
Okay...I'll teach you a technique.

111
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,230
Do you really mean that?

112
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:54,571
Do you remember what I told you
yesterday about the two types of Chakra?

113
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,740
Huh? Yesterday's talk?

114
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:02,120
You know, what you said about blue
and red Chakra or something.

115
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,706
Oh... What about it?

116
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,586
You said that when a great power
came out, you felt red Chakra.

117
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,547
Yeah, it was like that.

118
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,510
Try building up that red Chakra right now.

119
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,472
Even you say so...

120
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,682
I'll give it a try, but...

121
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,070
How about it?

122
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,948
It's not right.

123
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,158
It's the same Chakra as always.

124
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,162
Jeez, you have no talent.

125
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,041
Don't be talking all high and mighty!
In the first place,

126
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,545
I really don't understand those
two types of Chakra myself!

127
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,005
Just keep trying.

128
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,141
So he doesn't understand it...
himself, eh.

129
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,185
It seems Naruto himself still hasn't
realized that

130
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,399
the red Chakra is
the Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra.

131
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,407
Well, guessing from his story...

132
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,368
it seems the excitement of danger
and heightened emotion

133
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,621
are the key to summon
the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.

134
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,166
No good, not good.

135
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,127
Only the usual Chakra's coming out.

136
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,045
Say, Pervy Sage...

137
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,008
What the heck does the red Chakra and
the technique you're going to teach me

138
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,302
have to do with each other?

139
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,845
Listen, boy.

140
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,557
For the technique
I'm about to teach you,

141
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,311
the Chakra you've had until now
is not nearly enough.

142
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:55,650
Therefore, you'll have to able to
pull out and use the "other" Chakra

143
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,779
that has been dormant within
you at any time you need.

144
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:06,411
But how do you know that
I have such a Chakra?

145
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,164
Oh, just what I wanted to hear.

146
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,333
Actually...

147
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,503
it's because I'm a sage.

148
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,381
Jeez...that's no answer.

149
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,384
Anyway, the special Chakra
that only you have

150
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,012
will become your greatest weapon.

151
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,348
Greatest weapon?

152
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,144
Not using that is like wasting treasure.

153
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,648
There's no need to forcedly do
the same training as everyone else.

154
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,983
Everyone has what they're good at
and poor at.

155
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,196
You have your own style.

156
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:47,744
Your training until now, maintaining
and releasing a set amount of Chakra,

157
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,954
was in other words,

158
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,583
training to control the suppression of
Chakra so that you wouldn't get exhausted.

159
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,419
But you who have a lot of stamina

160
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,630
should be about power rather
than a cheap trick.

161
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,554
You, who has two types of Chakra
and doesn't exhaust easily,

162
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,015
should release the largest amount
of Chakra you can

163
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,562
and train to increase the absolute amount
of Chakra that you can use.

164
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,024
Then there are tons of Jutsu
and techniques you can use.

165
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,987
What, for example?

166
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,451
For example...summoning Jutsu
that I'm going to teach you now.

167
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,540
Summoning?

168
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,874
Right.

169
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,755
It's a type of spatio-temporal technique

170
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,259
where you sign a contract in blood
with all kinds of living creatures

171
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,595
and summon whenever you like
with Ninjutsu.

172
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,810
Oh! That sounds awesome.
Teach me quick!

173
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,147
Before that...

174
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,776
first, it's necessary to
use up all of your usual Chakra.

175
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,820
Okay!

176
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,781
Leave it to me.

177
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,124
Well... So you can use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

178
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:21,504
I have a good idea how to get rid
of my Chakra quickly.

179
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:40,273
Well, you've multiplied quite a bit.

180
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,487
Listen up. We're going to have
a battle royal now.

181
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,449
The last one left will be
the strongest me...

182
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,744
We're going to determine
the me among me!

183
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,953
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

184
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,417
I see.
Good thinking considering he's stupid.

185
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,252
Okay, let's go!

186
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:30,323
My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.

187
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,980
The finale is near at last.

188
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,761
Well done.

189
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,606
Sure enough, I'm the strongest me.

190
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,956
It looks like you've finally used up
almost all of your Chakra.

191
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,920
Now, at last I'll teach you
the technique.

192
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,839
Oh, I've been waiting!

193
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,884
First, I'll show you.

194
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,094
Watch carefully.

195
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,392
Summoning Jutsu!

196
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,319
So cool.

197
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,625
Open that scroll.

198
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,795
It's a contract with the
summoning toads

199
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,422
that I've taken over from generations.

200
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,342
Sign your name in your own blood

201
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,638
and stamp the fingerprints of one hand
in blood under that.

202
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,309
Then build up Chakra in the place
you want to summon

203
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,562
and set down the hand you contracted.

204
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:10,525
The Sign is
Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

205
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:21,494
NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.

206
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,216
Okay...This is fine, right?

207
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,805
It's easier for you to release
red Chakra right now.

208
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,057
So give it a try.

209
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,018
I already am.

210
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,980
Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.

211
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,233
Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.

212
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,633
A tadpole...

213
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,762
This kid...has no talent, after all.

214
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:53,169
Hayate...what in the world happened?

215
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,274
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

216
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,695
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

217
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,198
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

218
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,493
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

219
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:31,916
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

220
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,089
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

221
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,465
Fight! Fight! Fight!

222
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,021
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

223
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:56,232
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

224
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,694
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

225
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,448
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

226
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:09,704
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

227
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:15,710
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

228
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:16,836
Fight! Fight! Fight!

229
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,342
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

230
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:29,474
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

231
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,933
Fight! Fight! Fight!

232
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:41,194
Ino! When I was going to visit
Sasuke at the hospital by myself...

233
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,821
why are you coming along?

234
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,406
Besides, what is that flower all about?

235
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,743
A "rose for love"?
That's so lame.

236
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:55,500
I chose this daffodil for him,
hoping Sasuke will get better soon.

237
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,921
Next time, "A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope"

238
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,923
Cha! This is it!
