1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and
gather the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long
way to go on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards
the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,320
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,062
Kakashi Sensei...

16
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,566
The mission in the Land of Birds is over...

17
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,319
That is enough.

18
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,571
But, then what about Naruto...?

19
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,449
As the leader,
I am responsible for all of this.

20
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,412
Sacrifice is
an unavoidable part of Shinobi missions...

21
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,791
Now...

22
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,793
Let's go back to our village!

23
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,811
Do you think they're really
going back to their village, Nagare?

24
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,563
Perhaps...

25
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,609
But I'm concerned about that masked
guy who joined up with them later...

26
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,988
Shall I follow him, Hokushin?

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,118
No, I'll do that. You give the report.

28
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,369
All right...

29
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,709
The Death of Naruto

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,935
How did things turn out...?

31
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,565
The two as well as the one
who joined up with them later...

32
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,358
seem to have crossed the border

33
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,111
and are heading for
the Village Hidden in Leaves.

34
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,821
I see.

35
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,158
And it seems Lord Sagi took care

36
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,786
of the one who infiltrated
the residence of the feudal lord.

37
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,667
Very nice indeed.

38
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,844
What're they doing
there for the past hour...?

39
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,725
P-Persimmon! Wh-What the...?

40
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,229
– Ouch...
– That hurts...

41
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,690
It couldn't be!

42
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,365
Substitution Jutsu!

43
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,783
Since when...?

44
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,166
They tricked me! Those Leaf Shinobi...

45
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,525
Lord Komei... Come out.

46
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,197
Land of Birds Tactician Komei.

47
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,039
You have abused the key
position in this land of tactician

48
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,291
and committed the crime of assassinating

49
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,294
the previous feudal lord
Lord Owashi and his child Lady Toki.

50
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,505
And you also ordered a subordinate

51
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,341
to run wild as the ghost
called the Cursed Warrior,

52
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:45,220
disturbed the public,
you undermined the government of the land,

53
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,557
endangered
Lord Sagi's position of feudal lord

54
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,936
and attempted to
attain the position himself,

55
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,480
an unforgivable crime of treason!

56
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,902
Therefore, you are
ordered to perform seppuku!

57
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,164
I see...

58
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,833
That explains it.

59
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,295
You ensnared me, didn't you, Moso?!

60
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:26,220
You're disgraceful, Komei! If
you're a warrior, kill yourself like one!

61
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,472
Assist him with the seppuku at once!

62
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,556
– Yes, my lord!
– Yes, my lord!

63
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,576
Is this it now...?

64
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,382
Wh-What?!

65
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,386
Hidden Mist Jutsu? No! This is...

66
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,269
It does not matter! Kill him!
Yes, my lord!

67
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,563
Begging your pardon, I shall assist!

68
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,066
Who are you?!

69
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,404
Wh-What is this? What's going on?!

70
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,744
– The Cursed Warrior!
– It's the Cursed Warrior...

71
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,373
That's the Cursed Warrior?!
Yes!

72
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,167
After him! Don't let him get away!

73
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,543
– Right!
– Right!

74
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,307
You guys go after him as is...!

75
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,934
I've got something I want to look into,
so I'll be going on ahead!

76
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,144
– Roger!
– Roger!

77
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,203
I knew it!
You two were conspirators, right?!

78
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,954
Hold it!

79
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,541
You're the guys from the other night...

80
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,005
I've witnessed
the true identity of the ghost.

81
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,424
Who's there?

82
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,968
Hey-hey, Komei.

83
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,889
You're the one responsible for
controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?

84
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,104
I was also attempting to investigate

85
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,106
the true identity of
the Cursed Warrior that day...

86
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,529
I was almost sure
it couldn't be anyone but that person...

87
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,699
What a pain! I'll
expose the true identity here.

88
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,204
Don't bother...

89
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,833
Kakashi Sensei. Where were you until now?

90
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,544
I'll explain later. Go on ahead!

91
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,676
Hurry! You're going with them.

92
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,345
But...
Let's go, Tenten!

93
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,055
Wait, Neji!

94
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,641
Come on out...

95
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,309
You were following
me the whole time, right?

96
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,702
If that's your intention...

97
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,831
Summoning Jutsu!

98
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,167
What is it, Kakashi?

99
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,254
Smoke out the Ninja
hiding on the temple grounds...

100
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,422
Consider it done.

101
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,638
Hey! You there...

102
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,266
Hide-and-seek is over. Come on out now!

103
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,272
I can't fool a dog's
nose, as would be expected...

104
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,733
You finally grace me
with your presence, huh?

105
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,752
Why is there a hole...

106
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,004
in a place like this?

107
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,549
I have heard the feudal lord
built secret passages such as this

108
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,721
all over the land in order to look
in on the lives of the general public...

109
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,514
The feudal lord?!

110
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,684
Then that Cursed Warrior
has something to do
with the feudal lord...?

111
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,563
At the very least,
it seems he's not a ghost.

112
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,982
When the time comes,

113
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm sure he will reveal
his true identity from his end.

114
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,082
Isn't it common sense for hired Ninja

115
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,252
to return quietly to
their village after completing a mission?

116
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,921
It's different in the case

117
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,215
of the premise of
the commissioned mission breaking down.

118
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,677
There were too many
suspicious points in this mission.

119
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,264
You're sticking your nose too
far into the business of another land.

120
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,726
Here you could've
returned safely to your land

121
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,645
if you hadn't
secretively sniffed around like a dog.

122
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,855
Excuse me for being a dog!

123
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,240
Universal Assimilation Jutsu!

124
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,783
Prepare yourself!

125
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,080
What?!
What is this guy?!

126
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,291
Has he introduced
properties of stone into his body?

127
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,128
Since you've learned of
part of this land's secrets,

128
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,712
I can't let you live!

129
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,966
He seems to be
a somewhat troublesome opponent.

130
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,843
Yeah. That's good enough, Pakkun.

131
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,719
I'll be okay by myself from here on.

132
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,721
I see... See you later!

133
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,933
Assimilation: Rock Tank.

134
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,478
I'll crush you!

135
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,065
A Shadow Clone...?!

136
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,195
This is as far as it goes...

137
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,156
It can't be...

138
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,408
A Paper Bomb?!

139
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,062
Now... That should be enough, right?

140
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,275
Yeah... We should be
okay having come this far.

141
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,861
Th-That voice...?!

142
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,453
N-Naruto...!

143
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,290
I knew it.

144
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,753
The true identity of
the Cursed Warrior wasn't Lord Sagi?

145
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,743
Your...

146
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,371
Your true identity is...

147
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,794
Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?

148
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,094
From the way he was standing still,

149
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,720
I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.

150
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,683
There's a profound reason for this...

151
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,602
What're you doing, Tenten?!

152
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,896
Then tell me sooner!

153
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,233
It seems you also
knew it was Naruto, Neji.

154
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,859
Yeah... Ages ago.

155
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:24,072
Jeez, you two!
I was really worried!

156
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,034
There was a surveillance Shinobi
following us the whole time, right?

157
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,085
Neji, Tenten... Don't look back.
We're being followed!

158
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,513
We're going back to the Land of Birds.

159
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,724
Just do as I say... Got it?!

160
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,727
Y-Yes!
Understood...

161
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,231
But didn't we shake
the pursuer with Substitution?

162
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,900
Yes... Once...

163
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,534
However... when we chased the Cursed Warrior
from the execution grounds...

164
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,494
a different Shinobi followed us.

165
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,626
Jeez... Am I the only one who didn't know?

166
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,294
It was a waste to worry!

167
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,340
Then you, in the place of Lord Sagi...?
Yeah...

168
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,510
I see... So Lord Sagi is safe!

169
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,596
You okay, mister?!

170
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,182
I'm sorry... That Moso acted rashly,

171
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,353
forcing me to make a false confession.

172
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,523
Man, you've been beaten up good...

173
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,735
Well, we'll tell
you about the developments inside.

174
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,195
Sagi is waiting!

175
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,997
Assimilation: Rock Shower!

176
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,505
We're Wandering Shinobi...

177
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,550
We make do without having a village
by going around to every village,

178
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,721
stealing Jutsu and devising new Ninjutsu.

179
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,684
For example, a Jutsu like this one, too...

180
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,437
S-Say what?

181
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,358
Sharingan!

182
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,027
Assimilation: Sand Coffin!

183
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,199
He's using the same Jutsu as Gaara!

184
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,911
Assimilation: Sand Funeral!

185
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,045
Sagi!

186
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,090
How's Chishima doing...?

187
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,970
He's okay... There's no threat to his life.

188
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,849
He's resting and receiving treatment

189
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,225
in the treatment room of my residence.

190
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,149
That's good...

191
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,651
Did something happen to Chishima?

192
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,361
Who...? Who hurt him?!

193
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,990
Komei... I'm sorry for the misunderstanding!

194
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,326
My lord, I don't deserve
those magnanimous words!

195
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,789
Although he had suffered
injuries, Chishima came to tell me.

196
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,501
At that time...

197
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,507
I must not let you live as is

198
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,134
now that you have learned of everything!

199
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,387
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord,

200
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,848
your fate is the death sentence!

201
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,809
No way...!

202
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,020
L-Lord Sagi...

203
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,731
Chishima?!
Bro!

204
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,820
Shuriken wounds...?

205
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:51,905
Go to the residence doctor!

206
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,284
Lord Sagi... Please listen...

207
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,205
Lord Moso, no, Moso has betrayed you...

208
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,165
What?

209
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,209
Moso was the one

210
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,629
who killed your father,
Lord Owashi, and Lady Toki!

211
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,595
And Moso had his own Ninja
henchmen use the guardsmen shuriken

212
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,847
to falsely accuse Lord Komei...

213
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,227
I'm sure Lord Komei
learned of Moso's scheme and...

214
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,896
Hang in there, Chishima!

215
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,316
Lord Sagi, please...

216
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,528
Stop Lord Komei's execution.

217
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,947
We have to go save him quickly!

218
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,491
I must not stop the execution!

219
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,201
Wh-Why is that?!

220
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,411
I won't be able to have my revenge

221
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,873
if Moso realizes
that I have learned the truth...

222
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,209
Are you saying
it doesn't matter who is sacrificed

223
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,877
if it's for the sake of your revenge?!

224
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,796
Then what would you do?

225
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,507
Komei is being kept under
strict watch by powerful soldiers.

226
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,717
We would have no chance of winning

227
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,094
if theywe were to cause a rebellion there...

228
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:00,598
Then I'll go! I will save Komei on my own!

229
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,058
You don't have
a problem with that, do you?

230
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,436
Lord Sagi...

231
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,774
Do as you like...

232
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,988
And so I disguised
myself as the Cursed Warrior.

233
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,324
I played the part of Cursed Warrior

234
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,994
and attempted to look
for the assassination culprit...

235
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,764
But against my intentions...

236
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,852
Instead of finding the true culprit...

237
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:51,816
Komei... I was used
as a tool to incriminate you.

238
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,237
I thought the Cursed Warrior I encountered
in my bedroom

239
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,780
was you, Lord Sagi...

240
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,452
And so I headed for the abandoned temple

241
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,454
where the Cursed Warrior once vanished.

242
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,627
There I encountered
the Cursed Warrior, but...

243
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,504
That Cursed Warrior wasn't me.

244
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,591
Perhaps it was a fake that Moso devised.

245
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,803
That's it, believe it! All of
it was that old man Moso's trap!

246
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,015
That Moso!

247
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,808
Did he think to first dispose of me

248
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,895
and then eventually
attempt to rule the Land of Birds

249
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,189
by doing away with Lord Sagi?

250
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,191
That guy acting like a good guy!

251
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,776
I'll grab him up and kick his butt!

252
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,028
Naruto, was it? You did good work.

253
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:38,947
However...

254
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,742
I will take care of things from here on!

255
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,745
Well... But...

256
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,165
I will even the score by myself.

257
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,630
As long as the score isn't settled...

258
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:01,260
the clock inside my heart...
will remain stopped in the past!

259
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,740
So many things happen

260
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:28,538
on this endless road, huh?

261
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:34,168
Although you're strong-willed,

262
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

263
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,387
What dreams

264
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,852
did you chase to get here?

265
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:57,483
Even I have times when

266
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

267
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:09,412
When you're sad,

268
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:14,834
I'll be close to you

269
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:21,007
Even on nights when we're apart,

270
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

271
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,851
I'll be close to you

272
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,026
What do you mean you will
even the score on your own?!

273
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,487
What good can you do going by yourself?!

274
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,075
Even you did avenge
them, the dead won't come back!

275
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,287
Do you still insist on having revenge?!

276
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,706
Would that make you feel better?!

277
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,628
Would that really make
your father and sister happy?!

278
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,964
Next time: "When Time Stands Still"
