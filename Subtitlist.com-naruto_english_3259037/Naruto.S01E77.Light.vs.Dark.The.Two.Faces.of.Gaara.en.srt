1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,179
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:17,059
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,022
<=title>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,367
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,903
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,203
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,795
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

23
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,478
Dang it!

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,156
Darn it! Things will really be bad
if it stays like this...!

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,119
I'll have to...

26
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,459
I'll have to save...
everyone for sure!

27
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,756
Light vs. Dark:
The Two Faces of Gaara!

28
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,939
So you'll fight for the sake of others?!

29
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,943
That's why you guys are
only at that level!

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,654
You don't need a reason to fight!

31
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,368
Only the one who remains undefeated
can actually feel his own existence!

32
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,955
Come on, forget about
your insignificant friends

33
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,583
and fight only for the sake
of your own existence!

34
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,418
Insignificant...

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,629
friends?

36
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,386
Those who hold silly sentiments
about fighting

37
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,554
should just die!

38
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,432
I'm sick of listening to you talk!

39
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,059
I'll clobber you for sure!

40
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,524
You guys misunderstand real strength!

41
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,693
Shut up!

42
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,623
W-Why...? Why is it?!

43
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,792
Why Yashamaru...?

44
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,378
Why did you, why...?

45
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,549
Why...?

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,301
Love is...

47
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,222
a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

48
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,683
to love and watch over that person.

49
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,351
Just like my older sister did.

50
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,942
You are a precious person
who is close to me, Gaara!

51
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:42,616
Always...
only Yashamaru would always...

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,326
Me...always me...

53
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,580
It was an order.

54
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,503
I was commissioned to kill you...

55
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,466
By your father...

56
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,927
Lord Kazekage.

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,849
My father...?

58
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,526
Why did my father...?

59
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,986
Why...? Why me?

60
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,074
Gaara, you who were born and possessed
by the Sand Spirit Shukaku...

61
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,829
have been watched over
as an experiment.

62
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:35,335
However, Gaara, you couldn't
control the living spirit Shukaku,

63
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,214
the Sand Spirit which possesses
the power of the sand.

64
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:44,678
Eventually your existence would
become too dangerous for the village.

65
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,515
Before that occurred...

66
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,146
So Yashamaru, you had not choice...

67
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,440
but to comply with my father's order...?

68
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,402
No... That is not correct.

69
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,824
It is true I accepted
Lord Kazekage's order.

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,871
But if I had wanted to turn it down,
I could have turned it down.

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,875
Gaara...

72
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,422
Deep down in my heart,
I probably...

73
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,383
hated you.

74
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,013
You, whose birth took the life
of my beloved older sister.

75
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,390
The child she left behind in death...

76
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,728
Thinking that you were her remembrance,

77
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,107
I tried desperately to love you.

78
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,568
However... I was not able to.

79
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,155
My sister didn't choose to have you.

80
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,826
My sister became a sacrifice
for the village,

81
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,161
and she died while
cursing this village!

82
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,998
From that time, I probably...

83
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,002
have been burdened with a wound
of the heart that could never heal.

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,507
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,

85
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,509
it doesn't heal for one's entire life.

86
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,887
A wound of the heart?

87
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,936
Your name...
is the name my sister gave you.

88
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,400
"This child's name is Gaara...

89
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,610
"A devil that loves only itself...

90
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,946
"Love only yourself...

91
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,950
"And fight only for
your own sake.

92
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,745
"If you do that,
you will continue to exist."

93
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,248
Such was the hope it contained.

94
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,916
However...

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,294
my sister did not give you this name

96
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,380
because she was concerned
about you or loved you.

97
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,260
The reason she gave you this name,
a name so you would continue to exist...

98
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,723
...was so that the deep-seated hatred
of my sister

99
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,517
who died hating and cursing
this village...

100
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,438
would remain...

101
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,817
and be known to all!

102
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,838
You were never...loved!

103
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,973
This is the last...

104
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,935
Please die...

105
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,677
I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.

106
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,887
Love?

107
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:26,149
The sand automatically trying to
protect you is like the love of a mother.

108
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:31,196
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother's will.

109
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
Love.

110
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,879
Love only yourself.

111
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,799
And fight only for your own sake.

112
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,803
So that is Gaara...
That is me.

113
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,222
I finally understand.

114
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,267
I am alone.

115
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,355
I will no longer believe in anyone...
or love anyone.

116
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,441
I am alone!

117
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,783
Yes, I am all by myself.

118
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,843
What's the matter?
Hurry up and come at me!

119
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,555
Don't you care what happens
to your so-called precious friends?!

120
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,267
Sakura!

121
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,189
Dang it!

122
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,942
Naruto's not his usual self...

123
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,695
Did something happen between them?

124
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,614
In any case...

125
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,409
In any case,
I need to save Sakura!

126
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,286
But... what to do?!

127
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,873
That's it!

128
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,293
Since it's come to this...
Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra...

129
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,841
There's no choice
but to summon the Chief Gamabunta!

130
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,305
Summoning Jutsu!

131
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,024
What's this?! You're a little kid!

132
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,652
If you want something from me,
give me some snack!

133
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,863
If you don't, I won't play with you!

134
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,700
You know something?
I hate you frogs!

135
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,911
What did you say?!
Don't make fun of amphibians! Really!

136
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,833
Jeez, I don't have time to
play with you, little squirt!

137
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,296
Darn! Why is it...?

138
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,799
I practiced for so long, but with this,
there's no other way...

139
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,677
I need to save everyone!

140
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,806
Everyone...you say?

141
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,308
Don't make me laugh.

142
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,436
I fight...only for myself!

143
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,819
He...he's transforming again!

144
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:05,035
If you don't take me down,
the sand over this girl won't fall away!

145
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,705
Not only that, as time passes...

146
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,000
this sand will slowly squeeze tighter
and eventually suffocate this girl!

147
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,461
Sakura!

148
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,048
He's getting closer and closer
to being a Perfect Possession.

149
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,676
That Jutsu hasn't been activated yet,

150
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,929
but at this rate, I'll also be...!

151
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,351
Those eyes...

152
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,562
Sand Shuriken!

153
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,577
You're...really weak!

154
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,371
Shut up!

155
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,248
But what is that guy?

156
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:13,061
You're persistent...
Sarutobi Sensei!

157
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,024
I-It doesn't move?!

158
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,778
Y-You hard-to-kill fools!

159
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,200
Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?

160
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,122
The Leaf Village is my home!

161
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,251
I told you I am the pillar
of that house!

162
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:41,381
That's why I'm saying
I will break that pillar!

163
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,341
As long as the people of the village

164
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,846
fiercely fight to protect
their dear comrades,

165
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,433
the pillar of the Leaf Village will not
be broken by the likes of you!

166
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,893
I wonder about that.

167
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,397
Do not underestimate the Hokage!

168
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,193
I-Impossible...!

169
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:06,573
Where is...?
Most of your Chakra should be gone!

170
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,078
Chakra and Ninjutsu are
not all there is to strength!

171
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,209
W-What lonely eyes...

172
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,088
Such lonely eyes...

173
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,179
This guy is also turning into a monster...
the same as me.

174
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,357
I hated every last one of them.

175
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,984
I didn't understand who I was,

176
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:47,822
why I was so hated,
why I even existed.

177
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,200
In other words,

178
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:55,080
you're the Nine-Tailed Fox who killed
Iruka's parents and ruined the village!

179
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,417
You've been deceived by everyone
in the village all along!

180
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,378
I...

181
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,255
When I learned that the
Nine-Tailed Fox was inside me,

182
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,883
everyone in the village seemed
even more cold-hearted...

183
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,512
I was so deeply troubled...

184
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,432
But...

185
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,521
Naruto! Let's go have
ramen for a change!

186
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,357
Yay! I will, I will!

187
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,442
I'll have the one with
extra BBQ pork slices!

188
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,197
Huh! You loser...
If you want to beat me train harder!

189
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,701
Shut up! I won't lose to you!

190
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,496
Hey Naruto!
What did Sasuke say about me?

191
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,997
He didn't say anything...

192
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,252
By the way! By the way!
Wouldn't you rather know how I feel...?

193
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,379
Oh! Really, Sakura!

194
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,674
I'm gonna eat now!

195
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,638
Um... Naruto, you'll really die if you eat
only noodles and sweet red bean porridge.

196
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,266
You're a Ninja,
so eat more vegetables!

197
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,559
Here, have some!

198
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,437
What?! I don't like vegetables!

199
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,774
People appeared
who acknowledged me...

200
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,859
That's why I became all right,

201
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,362
even though there was
the demon fox inside my body,

202
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,032
or even if the people of the village
looked at me with cold eyes.

203
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,786
Because...
I wasn't alone anymore!

204
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,750
I never imagined how happy and
fortunate I could feel.

205
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,044
How really...really...

206
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,046
great it was.

207
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,048
How truly great it was
to be here.

208
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,720
I was relieved to know
I am allowed to be here, to exist!

209
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,975
That's why it scares me
to think about the past...

210
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
That suffering is agonizing...

211
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,105
It's a pitch-black hell!

212
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,650
If...I had remained that way, all alone...

213
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,864
That's precisely why I understand!

214
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,787
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

215
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,998
This is the answer I came to...

216
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,753
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

217
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,089
I don't know what happened, but...

218
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,302
This guy's always been
suffering all alone...

219
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,971
Even now, without ever feeling relief...

220
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,350
Only able to believe in himself...

221
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:24,229
Even now, he's battling in hell...

222
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,772
That's how it is...

223
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,150
To him, someone like me
who's acknowledged by others...

224
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,655
might seem like a weakling in
a world of happiness without tension...

225
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,117
Can I really win against
a guy like this?

226
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,290
What's the matter?!
Are you afraid of me?

227
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,545
To fight for the sake of oneself?
To fight for the sake of others?

228
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,842
You should just love yourself,
and fight for yourself!

229
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,387
That is the definition of
the strongest one!

230
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,390
Now fight me!

231
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,225
What happened to
the boldness you had earlier?!

232
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,188
Show me your strength!
I'll throw that strength to the ground!

233
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:14,153
Now what's the matter?!
If you don't fight me, I'll kill that girl!

234
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,783
Darn it!

235
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,788
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

236
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,376
Wind Style!

237
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,214
Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!

238
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,515
This isn't good...
He really got me.

239
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,476
First, I'll toy with you
without killing you!

240
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,688
I look forward to seeing
when and how you give up

241
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,148
and abandon your friends!

242
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,282
Naruto...

243
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,202
But...what is it?

244
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,789
It's far from over!

245
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,802
N-Naruto...

246
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,765
What is this...this feeling?

247
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,225
Sand Shuriken!

248
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,444
D-Dang it!

249
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,820
Dang it!

250
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,281
H-He's...

251
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:45,244
What is this?!
This feeling that's overcoming me?

252
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,208
Naruto...!

253
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,630
For some reason...
I don't want to lose to this guy...

254
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,341
You...

255
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,471
...even if I die!

256
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

257
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:15,608
It's nothing to be ashamed about

258
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:21,239
Don't let this scar be for naught

259
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:26,911
Walk with a smile

260
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:42,552
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

261
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:47,974
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

262
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:53,021
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

263
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:58,276
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

264
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,448
Everyone makes mistakes

265
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:08,578
It's nothing to be ashamed about

266
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't let this scar be for naught

267
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,213
Walk with a smile

268
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:24,427
Transform sadness into the wind

269
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,766
and continue to forge on

270
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:35,563
Forge on strong

271
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,618
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!

272
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,203
If you're far away,
listen well.

273
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,954
If you're closer,
then come and watch it!

274
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,706
Among all the Genin in the Leaf,

275
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,708
I'm the only one who's
suited to become Hokage!

276
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,543
I turn the biggest pinch
into opportunity

277
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,670
with Transform Jutsu, Summoning Jutsu,
and Shadow Clone Jutsu.

278
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,380
I give back twice as much
when I receive a punch.

279
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,758
I'm the hyperactive knucklehead Ninja!

280
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:08,846
This is the start of the spiraling series
of Naruto's Ninja Handbook!

281
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,809
Next time: "Naruto's Ninja Handbook"
