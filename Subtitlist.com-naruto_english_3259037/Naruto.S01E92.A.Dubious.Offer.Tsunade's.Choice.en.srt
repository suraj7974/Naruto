1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,141
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,728
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,112
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,366
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,704
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,458
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,711
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,173
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,010
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,463
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,298
A Dubious Offer! Tsunade's Choice

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,181
Not good...

24
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,561
Dang it! Dang it!

25
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,480
This time for sure...no matter what!

26
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,746
You're the only one who can treat
Lord Orochimaru's arms.

27
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,876
Why don't we make a deal?

28
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,257
I'll resurrect the little brother and man,

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,342
both of whom you loved...

30
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,346
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.

31
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,559
Don't you want to see those two, Tsunade...?

32
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,313
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk...

33
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,692
Their wishes... Moreover, Tsunade,
your wishes... And dreams...

34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,527
Did you forget them?!

35
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,988
I'll be straight with you.

36
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,072
Tsunade,

37
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:22,036
the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

38
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,914
The successive line of Hokages

39
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,000
have protected the Leaf Village
and those living in it.

40
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,545
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

41
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,465
They risked their lives for
this dream, this ideal!

42
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,554
You don't have to answer right now.

43
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,892
However, I want it in a week.

44
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,730
Also, two human sacrifices are
needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,

45
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,984
so do what you need to do to prepare them.

46
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,498
We are starting!

47
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,088
C'mon. Place your bets!

48
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,009
Which will you bet on, ma'am?

49
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,972
Which one? C'mon!

50
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,558
Which one will she choose?

51
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,854
If she agrees to our conditions,

52
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,607
your arms will be healed,

53
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,985
and the destruction of the Leaf Village
will continue immediately.

54
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,572
Lady Tsunade will also be able to
be reunited with the two whom she loves.

55
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,120
But if she doesn't agree...

56
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,332
I'll have to force her to heal my arms...

57
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,294
Will it really be that easy?

58
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,296
I have you.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,969
There's no need to worry.

60
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,390
I'm the one who knows her the best.

61
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,852
And her greatest weakness!

62
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,148
She'll definitely accept the conditions...

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,692
Definitely!

64
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,329
Listen, in this third step,

65
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,124
you've got to use 100%
of what you have learned...

66
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,459
And retain them.

67
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,639
In other words,

68
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,476
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon

69
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,353
and compressing the Chakra inside it.

70
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,358
I know that in my head...

71
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,153
But no matter what,

72
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,157
I can't completely hold 100%
of my power in a neat ball...

73
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,807
Don't give him false hope

74
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,809
by teaching him something he can't master.

75
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,978
That's why the moony kid

76
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,857
starts joking about becoming a Hokage!

77
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,164
Tomorrow, huh.

78
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,837
Come again, okay?

79
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,713
I certainly will!

80
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,690
Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?

81
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,409
To think she'd be that shaken up...

82
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,620
Something extreme must have happened.

83
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,625
That one week bugs me, somehow...

84
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:49,011
And Naruto hasn't come back
to the inn for nearly a week.

85
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,515
I guess I'll press Tsunade a little more.

86
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,654
No good...

87
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,285
No good... Why?

88
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,413
Here there's no time...

89
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,249
It'll be too late.

90
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,759
What's this...?!

91
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,972
What happened, Naruto?!

92
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,432
Are you okay?

93
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532
What do you want?

94
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,993
The moon's out.

95
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,206
How about going out for a drink?

96
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,011
Tomorrow will be the one week
you promised to Naruto.

97
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,437
I wonder what became of Naruto?

98
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,608
Beats me.

99
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,741
I guess I'll have something.

100
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,785
-Radish, please.
-Coming up.

101
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,173
Oh?

102
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,555
Here you go.

103
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,434
Ooh! This looks good.

104
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,333
Lady Tsunade!

105
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,878
What happened to Naruto?

106
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,298
He's quite exhausted and weakened.

107
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,885
And his right hand is severely burned
with Chakra...

108
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,722
As it stands now,

109
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,141
this kid probably won't wake up
until the day after tomorrow.

110
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,271
It's as Jiraiya says...

111
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,359
Why did I make such a stupid bet?

112
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,238
What am I, of all people,
getting so worked up for?

113
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,949
How stupid.

114
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,414
Tomorrow...

115
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,627
Please don't go tomorrow!

116
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,050
Why don't you say anything?!

117
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,637
Lady Tsunade! Please don't be silent.
Please answer!

118
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,225
If you say that you're going...

119
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,228
What will you do?

120
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,773
I'll stop you with my life!

121
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,905
Shizune... Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

122
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,223
Sir! It's morning, now!

123
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,933
It's about time you went home!

124
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
Geez.

125
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,693
Hey! Get up, sir...

126
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,908
Hey! What's wrong, you?!

127
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,463
It'll be troublesome if we're disturbed
during the negotiations...

128
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,798
What do you want me to do?

129
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,926
It might be good to kill...

130
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,929
Tsunade's attendant.

131
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,687
It seems that you...

132
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,482
You don't trust me completely...yet.

133
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,444
Precisely because I trust you...

134
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,365
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.

135
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,286
Well, then...

136
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,455
Kabuto...

137
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,791
If you wish to stop me...

138
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,796
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.

139
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,051
You can't possibly kill me...

140
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,517
Hey!

141
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,894
I said hey!

142
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,733
Naruto...?

143
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,529
Oh no! What time is it?

144
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,989
No, what day is it?

145
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,325
It's Monday...

146
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,412
What is it?

147
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,832
Is your body okay?

148
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,836
As I recall, you were supposed
to sleep for two full days...

149
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,339
No matter what the wound,

150
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,424
I'm always able to recover

151
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,803
if I sleep one night!

152
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,765
That's right.
This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox's power...

153
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,103
More importantly,
where's that stupid old woman?!

154
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,231
Today's the promised bet day.

155
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,149
Then, what about the Jutsu...

156
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,281
It's still not complete, but I can wing it...
Believe it!

157
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,704
That's right. This isn't the time for this.

158
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,748
– Naruto, please stay...
– Huh?

159
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,751
You are...!

160
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,962
What?! Oh!

161
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,261
Wait, Shizune!

162
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,724
That darned Tsunade

163
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,768
spiked my drink.

164
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,855
I can't build up my Chakra well...

165
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,568
And my body is so numb,
I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.

166
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,780
What was he gonna do if that had hit me?!

167
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,991
That's lame!

168
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,368
Here you're always bragging
about how you're this awesome Ninja!

169
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,288
And you're nailed by her perverted attack?
You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!

170
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,497
Shut up!

171
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,252
Even if she's rotten,
she's still a medical specialist.

172
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:25,967
She's the only one who could concoct
a tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.

173
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,180
But to think I'd be caught off-guard,

174
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,807
no matter how intoxicated I was...

175
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,284
I'm going to kill you, bastard!

176
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,131
How are you feeling, Master Jiraiya?

177
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,094
Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.

178
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,971
But be that as it may,
maybe around thirty percent...

179
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,562
I never thought I'd end up encountering
that Master Jiraiya in a place like this...

180
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,524
Things have gotten difficult.

181
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,859
I guess I'll pull back for now.

182
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,321
At any rate, Naruto...

183
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,282
To think you'd be here, too...

184
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,169
-Hey! Shizune.
-Y-Yes?!

185
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,588
It's about time you tell me

186
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,884
what the heck she was talking about
with Orochimaru.

187
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:51,803
Orochimaru?!

188
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,310
I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade...

189
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,773
That's why I couldn't say until now.

190
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,651
But...

191
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,282
There's no time. Please come with me!

192
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,868
-I'll explain as we run!
-Okay!

193
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,453
I'm going, too!

194
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,975
What's your answer?

195
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,479
Say what?!

196
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,399
The answer to that is definitely no!

197
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,403
This might be really bad...

198
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,326
She's probably still thinking
of those two.

199
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,751
Perhaps I may have no choice,
but to kill Tsunade...

200
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,630
Dang it!

201
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,060
I'll heal your arms...

202
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,314
In exchange for that,
keep your hands off the village.

203
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,902
Very well.

204
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,609
Now then...

205
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,253
He's planning to once again attack

206
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,838
the Leaf Village if his arms are healed!

207
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,883
The situation will get
even more dangerous than that

208
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,386
if he's not stopped now.

209
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,847
Him screwing around like that!

210
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,436
I have you.

211
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,813
There's no need to worry...

212
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,126
What's the meaning of this?

213
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,172
To think you'd betray me at this point...

214
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,514
Tsunade!

215
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,186
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

216
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,983
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

217
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,820
On your still shoulder

218
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,534
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

219
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:30,456
The city lights are like pieces of stars

220
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,751
That hold us together

221
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:39,924
"Each one of us

222
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

223
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,557
you say laughingly

224
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,645
but you look most dazzling

225
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,109
Like a comet,

226
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:03,072
like the rainbow after the storm

227
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,953
You bring light

228
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,456
into my heart

229
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

230
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:22,175
can be the answer

231
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:28,389
Let's promise

232
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,725
we won't cheat

233
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:35,021
Uh...like a shooting star, we do go ahead.

234
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,027
What the hell is this?! This castle
has been destroyed even further!

235
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,572
It seems Tsunade has declined the deal.

236
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,991
But...but the old lady is not here!

237
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,786
Calm down a second.
She shouldn't have gone far from here.

238
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,497
Oh, some incredible noise
from that direction, Pervy Sage!

239
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,208
Well, well...she started a flashy battle.

240
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,584
Naruto, we go after her!

241
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,295
Right! I'm ready anytime!

242
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,964
Next time: "Breakdown! The Deal is Off!"
