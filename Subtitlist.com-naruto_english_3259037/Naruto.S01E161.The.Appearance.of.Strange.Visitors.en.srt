1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,124
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,269
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,308
Our mission this time around
is a rough one.

16
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,434
Can you do it, Lee?

17
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,229
I'll be okay! I can go anytime.

18
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,190
Now that's my protégé!

19
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,276
Let's go, Lee!

20
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,111
Right, Guy Sensei!

21
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,034
They're off!

22
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:03,666
Those large bags no doubt mean
an overnight expedition mission.

23
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:08,504
To think we'd encounter the ideal pair
so quickly. We're lucky.

24
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,839
Then, it's settled.

25
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:14,760
Right. Starting operation.
To infilrtra... whoa!

26
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,311
H-Heavy! Get off, you idiot.

27
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,192
To...infiltrate...the super elite
hidden village...

28
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,946
the Village Hidden in Leaves!

29
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:39,952
The Appearance of Strange Visitors

30
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,915
Wow, we look just like those two!

31
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:54,341
Naturally. We refined
our Disguise Jutsu for this very day.

32
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,261
We're after the classified information
of the Leaf...

33
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,055
Right!

34
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,558
We'll be famous if this goes well!

35
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,977
The idea is to win distinction
for our village.

36
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,148
9Then we'll get tons of missions
and we'll be the village heroes!

37
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:16,155
Village Heroes!
Mondai and Poccha!

38
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,326
All right. As of this moment,
my name's Guy.

39
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,494
The Leaf Ninja, "Mondai Guy"!

40
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,705
And I'm the protégé, "Poccha Lee"!

41
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,290
Let's go, Lee.

42
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, Guy Sensei!

43
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,179
Nothing like a large village,
sure enough!

44
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,183
Wow, everyone's like a Ninja.

45
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,394
Hey! Don't be looking all
about so much!

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,271
Oww...
Listen up.

47
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,858
There's a chief in this village
called the "Hokage."

48
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,236
So there's no doubt classified information
is concentrated where that person is.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,321
I see.

50
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,822
If I remember correctly,

51
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,492
that person's in a building easy to spot
with a "Fire" mark on it or something...

52
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,500
– There it is!
– That's it!

53
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,335
What about the Lady Hokage's house?

54
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,920
– Yikes!
– Yikes!

55
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,546
Hi.

56
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:19,760
N-Nothing special! We're not after Leaf
classified information or any-any-any...

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,303
Are you an idiot?!

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,973
I-It's nothing at all!

59
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,265
Is that so?

60
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,310
Look, we've got to act naturally here.

61
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,520
R-Right...

62
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,814
Hi. I'm Guy.

63
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm Lee.

64
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,777
Guy and Lee..., eh...?

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,363
Don't you guys have
a different atmosphere than usual?

66
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,240
No. I-It's your imagination!

67
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,910
No, I feel like something's different...

68
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,206
Oh, there's a kite up there flying
while eating a pork cutlet rice bowl!

69
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,419
What? Where, where?

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,339
What? There's no kite anywhere.

71
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,757
Hey, what?

72
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,056
Jeez, that Ninja has to go and
stand behind us

73
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,933
without any sign of his presence.

74
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,394
But it seems we fooled him good.

75
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,564
Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect,
sure enough.

76
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,360
Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isn't it?!

77
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,320
The Leaf isn't worth fearing!

78
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,744
Guy and Lee imposters are
prowling around the village?

79
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,455
And to think they'd enter the village
in disguises

80
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,206
without even using Transformation Jutsu.

81
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,333
Are they really Ninja?

82
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,421
Weird people find their way
in when a village grows.

83
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,801
Well, it's nonsense, but I thought
I would at least report it for now.

84
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,431
Indeed, we can't just leave
intruders unchecked.

85
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,932
Shall we throw them out?

86
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,934
No, leave them be.

87
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,019
What?

88
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,229
It sounds interesting, doesn't it?

89
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,483
They're going to the trouble of
calling themselves Ninja of this village.

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,693
But...

91
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,779
We probably don't need to worry.

92
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,241
It's unlikely that anyone could be
fooled by such obvious imposters.

93
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:13,165
Come on, please.
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!

94
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,628
Pretty please with sugar on top!
Just the one day today would be fine!

95
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,130
Let me join your training!

96
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,926
Hey! What's with this guy
all of a sudden?

97
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
He's probably a real acquaintance
of theirs, but...

98
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,056
Does he think
we're going to do training?!

99
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,729
I'll do anything! I've always
been interested in Taijutsu.

100
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,065
I mean...okay?! It's okay, right?

101
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,442
Anyway, let's turn him away!
Right!

102
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,153
No. Take a pass.

103
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,738
What? Why?!

104
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:49,576
Because our training is very harsh,
rough and difficult.

105
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,412
Difficult training, huh...?

106
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,707
Ahhh, I'm getting even
more fired up! Please!

107
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,377
I won't get in your way,
no matter what!

108
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,796
Come on.

109
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,631
– Absolutely not!
– Absolutely not!

110
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,676
All right, since it's come to this!

111
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,427
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

112
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,639
Real body clones?!

113
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,099
– And furthermore...
– And furthermore...

114
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,309
– Harem Jutsu!
– Harem Jutsu!

115
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,395
Wh-What?!

116
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,192
– What?!
– What?!

117
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,407
– Pl-ea-se.
– Pl-ea-se.

118
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,451
– Okay!
– Okay!

119
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,536
What?!

120
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,788
Yes!

121
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,707
– No way.
– No way.

122
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,627
Brother, why'd you say okay?

123
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,880
What's done is done,
so it can't be helped, right?!

124
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,424
Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!

125
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,012
What's the deal, you two?

126
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,347
We're going to the farm today, right?

127
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,515
Farm?

128
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,767
What're you doing letting
your mind wander?

129
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,645
The person's waiting.
Come on, hurry!

130
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,689
– Huh? Oh...
– H-Hey!

131
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,149
Hey, wait!

132
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,610
– What...?
– Huh?

133
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,573
I promised to plant rice for
the sake of training?

134
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,116
Not only that, all of this...

135
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,577
It's totally huge.

136
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,497
Gee, thanks. It's a big help,
you guys giving me a hand.

137
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
Please don't worry about it.

138
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,003
They accepted this on
their own accord, so. Bye.

139
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,884
Why is this training?

140
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,093
I get it!

141
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,722
Indeed, I will use my body quite
a bit if I do this training.

142
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,808
So I can get in shape
while helping out, huh?

143
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,353
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!

144
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,730
I'll do my best!

145
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,566
Why's he that motivated?

146
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,278
Why should we have
to do this manual labor...?

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,073
Damn it.
Anyway, let's get this over with!

148
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,157
You're right.

149
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,666
Th-That's mean, brother!

150
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,668
Oh, sorry about that.

151
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,879
What?

152
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,510
Poccha?!

153
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,640
Come to think of it, there are
flying leeches in the rice fields,

154
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,475
so be careful.

155
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,435
F-Flying leeches?!

156
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,403
Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly.

157
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,614
Yikes.

158
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,451
Hey Poccha!

159
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,161
Hang in there!

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,300
Just what I'd expect of Taijutsu training!

161
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,885
That was some intense rice planting!

162
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,598
Phew, that was a good workout!

163
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,975
W-We're done...

164
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,144
Th-That was life or death...

165
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,895
Then, shall we move on?

166
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,404
– A manure receptacle?!
– A manure receptacle?!

167
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,740
Spread this in that field over there.

168
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,994
Th-This is also training...?

169
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,539
H-Heavy...Smelly...

170
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,458
Why should I have to do
something like this...?

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,759
Hey, you guys,
why don't you walk straight?

172
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,471
Y-You can walk twice
the forward progress distance

173
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,848
if you move ahead while
walking left and right like this!

174
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, so that was it?

175
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,352
Then I'll also...

176
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,396
Like this?

177
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,609
I-It's really hard to balance like this!

178
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,944
D-Damn it!

179
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,034
Gee, I didn't realize at all that
there was a method of training like this...

180
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,286
Hey! Watch it.
Walk more over there...

181
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,789
What'd you say?

182
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,689
What a nightmare.
Forget about it.

183
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,067
Anyway, let's lose the kid right now.

184
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,780
As for you guys,
you still kind of smell bad.

185
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,281
– Shut up!
– Shut up!

186
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,492
There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.

187
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,369
Oh, Sakura.

188
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,454
Oh, Naruto. You're here, too?

189
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,960
As for me,
I'm training together with these two today.

190
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,670
R-Really?

191
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,630
More importantly, is something up?

192
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,635
Yeah... Actually, I really wanted
your help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.

193
00:11:58,927 --> 00:11:59,928
– What?
– What?

194
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,806
– Your laundry blew away in the wind?
– Your laundry blew away in the wind?

195
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,518
That's right.
It got caught in a bit of a high spot.

196
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,897
No. No way, no way.
We've got lots of work to do, so.

197
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,818
Come on! Here I'm asking precisely
because it's you guys.

198
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,736
Please don't say no!

199
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:23,368
Sakura, if you're in that much trouble,
I could get it for you!

200
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,121
Okay, Guy Sensei?

201
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,248
Okay?!

202
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,125
Sure.

203
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,758
What a sheer cliff.

204
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,970
That's for sure. We'd be beyond help
if we were to fall from up there.

205
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,307
Right? I don't quite have the confidence...

206
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,184
That means...

207
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,103
Yup! It's right above here.

208
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,660
Gee, as one would expect,
I don't think we could...

209
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,621
Isn't that great, Sakura?

210
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,750
For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is
no different than a flat path.

211
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,710
That's encouraging.

212
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,756
It's a big help having an awesome Ninja
like you close by, Guy Sensei.

213
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,133
What? Uhh... Umm...

214
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,595
Now, please.

215
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,555
Brother...

216
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,102
Damn it. Why is this happening?!

217
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,813
I-I don't want to die.

218
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,690
D-Damn it!

219
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:41,238
Hey, as for you guys,
why aren't you using the Chakra suction?

220
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,658
,Th-This is training for building up
muscular strength!

221
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,368
So that's what it was?!

222
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,787
Just what I'd expect of a Taijutsu user.

223
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,666
I never came up with deliberately
draining physical strength!

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,461
I really do learn a lot from
being with you, Sensei.

225
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,879
Th-This jerk...

226
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm...I'm going to die...

227
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,590
Alley-oop!

228
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,342
No!

229
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,844
Th-That was close...!

230
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,558
Gee, sorry about that.

231
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,227
This jerk...

232
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,861
All right, we made it.

233
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,073
Don't look down!

234
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,243
Anyway, if we can just take
this back with us...

235
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,580
Damn it...

236
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,206
All right, I got it.

237
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,168
It won't come loose...
Hey, help me out here.

238
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,336
R-Right...

239
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,844
You little...!

240
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,476
Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!

241
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,604
This is nothing to me!

242
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,939
Look out!

243
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,027
For real? What?!

244
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,863
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!

245
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,999
I've had it...

246
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,960
Sensei, Bushy Brow!

247
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,421
That was awesome!

248
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,300
To do something like not
using Chakra suction. Awesome!

249
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,676
– Look you...!
– Look you...!

250
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,429
Perfect timing, you guys.

251
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,389
Old Lady Tsunade.

252
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,850
Actually, I've got something
I want to ask you guys to do.

253
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,188
My companion suddenly started
not feeling well, you see.

254
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,983
– Yikes! It's huge!
– It's huge!

255
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,527
It seems she's caught a cold.

256
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,824
It's a huge slug. Oh, as for this,
is it something like Chief Toad?

257
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,494
Well, that sounds about right.

258
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,997
However, as you can see,
we can't carelessly move her.

259
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,000
Sorry, but could you guys look
after her for a while?

260
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,338
I'm very sorry.

261
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,847
Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.

262
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,768
Brother, at this rate we won't be able
to look for the confidential information.

263
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,520
Oh, that's right.

264
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,230
Shut up.

265
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,607
What're you moaning about?

266
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,741
You guys.

267
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,661
It couldn't be that you guys

268
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,705
can't listen to the words of me,
the Hokage, could it?

269
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,207
– This is the Hokage?
– This is the Hokage?

270
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,296
This is bad. To think the Hokage
was that fierce a person.

271
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,633
We're taking care of
her precious companion.

272
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,178
We might be able to get into
the Hokage estate surprisingly easily.

273
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,596
I wonder.

274
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,058
So even Summoning animals
get sick, too...

275
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,644
It seems to be a light cold.

276
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:04,566
My nose itches, I have a sore throat
and I feel weak or something...

277
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,944
Hey, I'm going to chill your forehead!

278
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,029
Thank you so much.

279
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,660
All right, here we go.

280
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,122
Oh...Oh no. The itching...

281
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:26,921
What?!

282
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,844
– Wha...!
– What?!

283
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,686
It's... It's melting...

284
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,354
Watch it, you!

285
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,150
I'm very sorry. I'll be more caref...

286
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,036
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!

287
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,413
You'll be in danger if you don't
move away from there!

288
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,831
My...My lower back...

289
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,583
Y-You idiot!

290
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:08,004
I'm developing my dynamic vision
for narrowly evading danger!

291
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,465
Wha...? That Sensei,

292
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,218
he was training, putting his life
at risk even at times like this...?

293
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:18,723
Even though that Bushy Brow guy's
training properly, as for me...!

294
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,268
I've woken up,

295
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,772
Guy Sensei, I'll train with you!

296
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,775
Let's do this!

297
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:36,741
Ohh, the joints in my body hurt...
I feel like I'm going to fall apart...

298
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,580
Hey! Aren't you a slug?
What're you doing talking about joints?!

299
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,920
– S-Save us.
– S-Save us!

300
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,012
I've had it.
What's going on with this village...?

301
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,516
I'll die if I stay in a place like this
any longer.

302
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,144
Withdraw...
Right.

303
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,239
Who're you guys?

304
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,992
Why are you dressed like
my protégé Lee...?

305
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,451
Damn it!

306
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,995
Since it's come to this,
I don't give a damn anymore!

307
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:29,127
– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!

308
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,005
I don't really get it, but it seems
we just have to fight, huh?

309
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,089
So it seems.

310
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,757
Let's go, Lee!

311
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,551
Now, knockout technique!

312
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,929
– Double Dynamic Entry!
– Double Dynamic Entry!

313
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,852
Damn it. What did we go there for
in the end?!

314
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,021
I really hate, I really hate...

315
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,565
– the likes of the Leaf!
– the likes of the Leaf!

316
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,693
Tamaya!

317
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,241
Lord knows where they came from,

318
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,952
but now they'll probably never
want to try that again.

319
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,246
You sure looked like
you were having fun, Lady Tsunade,

320
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,081
going so far as to summon Katsuyu.

321
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:11,419
Well, my adorable Genin
helped out as well, so.

322
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,425
Now, we've had our breather.
So please be getting back to work.

323
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,593
Oh yes, ma'am.

324
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,764
But still...
What was with that Naruto?

325
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,475
To think he seriously believed
those two were for real.

326
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,936
What was that all about?

327
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,020
Who knows...?

328
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,188
Hey!

329
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,648
Naruto.

330
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,734
– Someone who looked just like me now...
– Man, you guys got separated.

331
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,861
I didn't know what to do.

332
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,155
As for me, I was impressed!

333
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,617
– You guys were really cool earlier!
– Huh?

334
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,663
I've learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu
or something...

335
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,083
A lot happened, but I'll continue
training right away!

336
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,043
Continue training?

337
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,755
So come on, let's continue
the Taijutsu training!

338
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:03,513
Moron, moron, moron.

339
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,740
So many things happen

340
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:28,454
on this endless road, huh?

341
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:34,043
Although you're strong-willed,

342
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

343
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,387
What dreams

344
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:51,269
did you chase to get here?

345
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,691
Even I have times when

346
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:03,322
I just don't understand, baby

347
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:09,412
When you're sad

348
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:14,834
I'll be close to you

349
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:20,339
Even on nights when we're apart,

350
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

351
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,976
I'll be close to you

352
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:42,153
Damn it! Why should a Ninja have
to do something like get rid of a ghost?!

353
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,614
We have no choice, right?
After all, a commission is a comission!

354
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,326
The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?!
Th-That's ridiculous!

355
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,870
But they say it comes out at night!

356
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,414
A ghost warrior clad in a white armor!

357
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,958
N-No, I'm not afraid of it at all!

358
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,251
H-Hey! Behind you!

359
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,503
No!

360
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,089
I knew it! You ARE afraid!

361
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,965
Next time: "The Cursed Warrior"
