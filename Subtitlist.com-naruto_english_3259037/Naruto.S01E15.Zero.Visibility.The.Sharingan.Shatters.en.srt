1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,720
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,061
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,244
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,123
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,550
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,635
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,888
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,974
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,934
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,479
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,029
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,244
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,417
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,213
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,895
Darn it!

21
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,482
Where'd he attack from?!
Is it the clones?

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,946
Where's the real body?!

23
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,949
It's useless for you to even attempt
following with your eyes.

24
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,159
I absolutely will not be caught.

25
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,954
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

26
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,914
Don't!

27
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,719
This is a teleportation Jutsu that

28
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,056
uses mirrors that can
reflect only my image.

29
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,975
Watching you from the speed I move,

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,019
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all...

31
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:25,980
I knew it!

32
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,316
Is that Jutsu...
the Kekkei Genkai?!

33
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,946
Kekkei...Genkai...?

34
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,074
It's the same type as
my Sharingan...

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,534
Then...!

36
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,160
That's right...

37
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:44,331
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu...

38
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,001
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!

39
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,716
Darn it...

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,219
So... What?!

41
00:02:57,303 --> 00:03:00,848
I can't die here yet.

42
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,393
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality...

43
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,022
The dream to have my strength
recognized by everyone in the village...

44
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,025
and become the Hokage!

45
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,693
Dream...

46
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:21,619
I, for the sake of my dream.
And you, for the sake of your dream.

47
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,913
Please don't hold it against me.

48
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,583
I want to protect someone
special to me...

49
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:32,838
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,

50
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,049
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality...

51
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,967
That's my dream.

52
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,638
For the sake of that dream
I will completely become a Shinobi,

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,973
and kill you guys!

54
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,320
Zero Visibility:
The Sharingan Shatters

55
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,828
Sasuke! Naruto!
Don't lose to a guy like that!

56
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,706
Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!

57
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,791
What?

58
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,045
Even if there was a chance that
we could break that technique,

59
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,757
they won't be able to defeat that boy.

60
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,052
W-What do you mean?

61
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,683
They don't have the mentality
to kill their feelings...

62
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,601
and kill another person!

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,607
That boy really knows
the agony of being a Shinobi.

64
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,777
He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.

65
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,946
Exactly...

66
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:45,244
No real Shinobi will come out of
a peace-addicted village like yours.

67
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,873
Because they are not able
to learn

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,960
the most important "experience of killing"!

69
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,506
Then...
Then...

70
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,134
What are we going to do, Sensei?!

71
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,348
If I go over to
Naruto and Sasuke,

72
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,600
Tazuna will be in danger.

73
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,770
Even if I try the Shadow Clones.

74
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,570
He'll come to stop me with
his Water Clones.

75
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,239
I'll just be wasting Chakra.

76
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,241
Then...

77
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,286
I'm sorry but...

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,415
I'm going to have to finish
this in an instant.

79
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,667
Sharingan?!

80
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,129
The Sharingan again?

81
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,590
Such an unimaginative guy!

82
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,610
Sensei!

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,369
You might call me "an unimaginative guy,"

84
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,539
but you are afraid of the Sharingan,
after all... Zabuza!

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,795
The secret technique of a Shinobi...

86
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,465
isn't something that you show
your opponent so many times.

87
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,883
Be appreciative.

88
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,929
You're the only who has had
the chance to see it twice...

89
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,891
And there will be no third time...

90
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:38,398
Even if you were able to defeat me,
you can't defeat Haku...

91
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,525
What...?

92
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,156
Kakashi Sensei can't win?

93
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,784
That boy in the mask is that strong?

94
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,913
Since he was a kid, I have been
painstakingly teaching him

95
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,666
the battle techniques of the Ninja!

96
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,771
All of my techniques.

97
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,609
On top of that...

98
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,529
he has been polishing up
his own skills as well!

99
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,367
As a result...

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,077
He has...

101
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,165
no matter how unbelievably difficult
his predicament,

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,877
been extremely successful.

103
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:47,176
He has no "heart" and has
abandoned the notion of "life."

104
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,471
He is a fighting machine
known as a Shinobi.

105
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:57,352
Not only that,
his Jutsu surpasses mine!

106
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,106
The terrifying ability of
the Kekkei Genkai.

107
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,652
In other words,
I have acquired a sophisticated tool.

108
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,698
Unlike the scrap you're
carrying around.

109
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,994
I'm not one to be afraid just
because I failed once!

110
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,704
I'll do it as many times as it takes!

111
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,831
The Shadow Clone Jutsu!

112
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:18,916
Stop!

113
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,284
W-What the hell is it...?!

114
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,248
I-It was just slight but...

115
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,925
I could see the trails of his movements...

116
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,843
One more try!

117
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,347
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

118
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,736
Don't you understand that it's useless?

119
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,089
Just because I see the trail,

120
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,300
doesn't mean that I can keep up
with his speed.

121
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,016
The water...
is being repelled.

122
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,105
But, what if that wasn't water...?

123
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,859
All right...

124
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,569
The next one is going
to be my one shot!

125
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,364
Just because a bunch of scrap
got together

126
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,575
doesn't mean that
they can defeat Haku.

127
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,536
He is...
He is the best tool!

128
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,415
There's nothing boring than
a stranger bragging...

129
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,960
It's about time...
I make my move.

130
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,297
Now wait.
As long as we're talking...

131
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,966
Let me brag about another thing...

132
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,092
Hmm?

133
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,220
In the battle before,

134
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,475
I didn't just let you defeat me
like a fool.

135
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,328
It's over...

136
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,291
Haku, who was hiding in the corner,

137
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,253
was observing part of the battle.

138
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,006
Haku is quite smart.

139
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,591
With his ability to analyze,

140
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:19,221
he is able to plan a counterattack
after observing a technique just once.

141
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,519
I've been anxious to copy your line.

142
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:33,360
"I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu
won't work on me twice."

143
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,736
Was that it...?

144
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,450
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!

145
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,759
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!

146
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,646
This is...?!

147
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,702
What is this...?
This really thick fog?

148
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,037
The visibility is close to zero...

149
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,622
Sensei...!

150
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,794
Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!

151
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,130
That's right.

152
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,758
I have to trust Sasuke,
Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now...

153
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,470
And I should do what I can do!

154
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,430
Huh?

155
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,056
Oh! Sakura!

156
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,103
Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,
don't move away from me!

157
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,063
Yeah... I soo know it!

158
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,403
I know...
Zabuza...

159
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,239
I'll finish them off soon enough...

160
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,455
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

161
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,375
You just don't learn, do you?!

162
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,510
What? The Fire Style Jutsu!

163
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,189
It takes...too long!

164
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,140
This is good!

165
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,060
Bit by bit, I'm figuring out
the timing...

166
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,658
I know it's called Hidden Mist,
but the fog is way too thick...

167
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,411
Even Zabuza himself shouldn't
be able to see anything...

168
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Good job on dodging it...

169
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,880
Just what I expect of Kakashi
of the Sharingan...

170
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,723
He's... closing his eyes!

171
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,476
But...the next time you see me,

172
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,312
that'll be the end of it all...

173
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,815
You overrate the Sharingan too much.

174
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,025
What...?

175
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,822
You spoke as if you saw through
everything, but...

176
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,161
Why?

177
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,999
Could it be possible that
you can see the future...?!

178
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,004
You are going to die.

179
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,674
Your foresight was wrong, after all.

180
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,801
Kakashi...

181
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,722
You can't read my mind or
my future...

182
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:35,226
The Sharingan is merely a diversion
that makes you believe that!

183
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,147
Those who have the Sharingan...

184
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,361
possess both
perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes...

185
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,451
Using these two powers and
bringing out Jutsus one after the other..

186
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,998
you were just acting as if
you can read the future!

187
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:04,381
First with the perceptive eyes,
you copied my movement right away.

188
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,425
And this is the Image
Replication Method.

189
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,976
You first got me in
a ruffle with it...

190
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,813
Once you make sure that
I'm flustered,

191
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:24,567
you nail the "heart's voice."

192
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,238
– This is the Mind Imitation Method.
– It's only an imitation, after all.

193
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,701
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!

194
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,412
That imitating monkey mouth...

195
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,163
I'll make sure that you won't be
able to open it any more!

196
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,665
And...

197
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,419
You judged the right timing when
my frustration was reaching its height

198
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,628
W-What is that?

199
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,673
You set a clever trap.

200
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,591
Me...?

201
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,010
You used the Genjutsu with
your hypnotic eye and

202
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,557
made me weave the signs first...

203
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,561
This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...

204
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,397
The Giant Vortex Jutsu!

205
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,992
R-Ridiculous!

206
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,497
Then that makes it easier.

207
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,460
First vanish into the thick fog,

208
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,879
and make your
perceptive eyes useless...

209
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,089
Huh?

210
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,968
Darn! The guard is falling behind!

211
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,847
I will close my eyes as well!

212
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:40,143
I will shut off your ability to use
your hypnotic eye

213
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,853
in a close-distance battle.

214
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,023
Why?

215
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,567
That also means that
you will lose your ability to see.

216
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,111
Did you forget...?

217
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,907
That I am a genius in Silent Killing,

218
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,495
a technique to find
the target just by sound.

219
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,880
He read my movement...
No way could he do that.

220
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,592
Darn! We were so close!

221
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,136
Naruto, can you still move?

222
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,807
Of course! I'm totally fine!

223
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,811
He's pretty much spent...
and it's no wonder.

224
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,688
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.

225
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,525
But thanks to him,
I found our way out.

226
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,944
I found the way to break through!

227
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,364
Impossible!

228
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,994
That was just a coincidence.

229
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,166
Naruto! Run!
What?

230
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,127
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!

231
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,880
A-All right!

232
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,509
You won't be able to...!

233
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,857
I-I'm not going to lose!

234
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,443
There!

235
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,404
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

236
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,015
Darn!

237
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,476
T-That was good just now!
What?

238
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,937
We're doing it one more time!

239
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,732
All right!

240
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,113
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!

241
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,116
To prove that,
he's little by little...

242
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,625
This won't go as you've planned.

243
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,711
First, I'll get you!

244
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,551
Sasuke!

245
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:32,482
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.

246
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,402
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...

247
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:46,454
Be calm... Think...
What will he come after?

248
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,456
Oh no!

249
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,641
What?!
Too late!

250
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,792
Why? Why is it?

251
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,795
Why did this happen?

252
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:06,511
I never asked for your help!
I hated you!

253
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,720
But you...

254
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:13,226
Darn! I won't forgive you!

255
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,396
Next episode:
"The Broken Seal"
