1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,091
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:16,517
listen up!

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,946
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,992
You're not old enough

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:39,498
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,795
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,549
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,754
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:38,432
A Lesson Learned!
The Iron Fist of Love

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,532
Please don't die...
I'll get you out now.

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,414
Hey!

24
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,293
What are you doing there?

25
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,931
Curry of Life Shop

26
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:28,732
One, two...
One, two...

27
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,364
Hope they're all right.

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,451
I'm sure they'll be able
to bring Karashi back.

29
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,081
Definitely, Definitely.

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,958
One, two...

31
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,719
That's the Katabami Gold Mine...

32
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,139
Instead of just getting
Rokusuke and Karashi back,

33
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,726
let's finish the Kurosuki Family
once and for all!

34
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,936
Don't get carried away, Naruto.

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,397
So, what are we gonna do then?

36
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,192
I'm kind of worried about
what Guy Sensei told us.

37
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,236
The boss of the Kurosuki Family
may be

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,156
one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist.

39
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,950
Who knows what
they'll do to Rokusuke?

40
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,871
Yeah, but how seriously
can we take Guy Sensei's info?

41
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,292
What are you talking about?!
Guy Sensei is always right!

42
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,754
Calm down, Lee.
We should investigate first.

43
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,255
Yeah!

44
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,028
Sir Raiga, we were able
to capture Rokusuke,

45
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,322
one of the three that
slipped out of the village.

46
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,454
Well done.

47
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,964
It seems that they went to ask
for some help from a Ninja village.

48
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,676
-Where did you go?!
-I'm sorry.

49
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,636
Don't bother, rookie.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,888
Yes sir!

51
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:28,310
Rokusuke, I thought we had
a good relationship

52
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,313
with everybody in the Gold Mine.

53
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,483
Well, that's...

54
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:41,532
Why is it? I'm so deeply sorry
to hear that you left the village.

55
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,952
I can't remember how things
were in the past,

56
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,453
when everything was going well.

57
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,164
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again!

58
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,376
Yeah, I have a good idea.

59
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,379
I'm going to arrange
for your funeral.

60
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,551
Please don't! Please let me go!

61
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,513
I won't do it again,
so please forgive me!

62
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,225
Why? Don't you like funerals?

63
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,270
No, I don't wanna die yet!

64
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,566
You know, I really like funerals...

65
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,317
Think about it.

66
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:21,822
When they are alive, humans speak ill
of each other,

67
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,782
they betray each other,
and they hate each other.

68
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,619
But at a funeral,

69
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,956
they forget all the hatred
they had for the other.

70
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:37,171
They even remember
the good times they had together. Right?

71
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,508
You have to be kidding me!
No! Please don't do it.

72
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,676
Hey!

73
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,928
Let me go!

74
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,849
It's a done deal then.
Let's have a big funeral for Rokusuke.

75
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,434
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

76
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,049
Come on!

77
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,134
Hurry up!

78
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:29,223
Is that gold?
There's nothing shiny about it.

79
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,433
They have to melt
that ore into mercury.

80
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,229
After that they evaporate it
and only then does it turn into pure gold.

81
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,689
I don't get it.

82
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,234
Well, there is no need
for you to understand it.

83
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,622
Huh? What are you doing?!
Hurry up!

84
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,124
If you don't hurry up,

85
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,918
I'm gonna ask the boss
to let me hold your funeral!

86
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,129
Please forgive me!

87
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,342
I'm getting really mad now.
I won't forgive them!

88
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,219
Calm down, Naruto...

89
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,305
We don't know anything
about them yet.

90
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,933
That's right. We should do
what Neji is telling us.

91
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,434
Yeah but...

92
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,604
if we don't do something,
that poor old guy is going to die!

93
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,482
Naruto, leave things to me here.

94
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,567
Wait, Lee!

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,570
Hey, hey.
Hurry up and pick them up!

96
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,920
Yeah! Way to go, Lee!

97
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,423
Are you okay, old man?

98
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,637
Oh my gosh!
What have you done?!

99
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,681
Here. Drink some water.

100
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,977
What are you doing?!

101
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,938
I beg you.
Please punch me, kick me.

102
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,481
Please knock me around

103
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,649
like the way you just did
with those guys.

104
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,152
What are you saying?

105
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,821
If you won't do it,
I'll do it myself!

106
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
What are you doing?!

107
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,867
Stop!

108
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,619
I'm scared.

109
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,079
Just think what they'll do

110
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,582
if they knew I was
the only one that was safe.

111
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,799
What was that sound?

112
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,927
Did they find us?

113
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,431
Oh my, that's the sound
of the funeral bell.

114
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,599
Funeral?

115
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,059
Yeah.

116
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:42,189
Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family
which rules this town,

117
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,524
arranges a funeral for
those who betray him.

118
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,109
He buries them alive.

119
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,405
What? They bury them alive?
That's so cruel!

120
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,783
Yeah but...

121
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,870
Raiga always cries sadly
during the funeral.

122
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,457
That's one weird guy.

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,708
But...

124
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,295
That doesn't seem to be
the sound of the bell for you.

125
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:10,634
Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke
was caught this morning, so...

126
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,052
What?!

127
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:53,051
I'm so happy, I remember
the first day I met that guy.

128
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,846
Yeah? That's nice.

129
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,639
Yeah...

130
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:03,312
When I told him we were taking
over the mountain from the magistrate,

131
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:07,524
he was so relieved to be freed from
the high taxes that he was paying.

132
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:15,282
He was laughing out of pure joy...
He was a really nice guy.

133
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,121
I like funerals.
Makes me feel nostalgic.

134
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,291
Would you put on
a big funeral for me too?

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,502
Fool! I'm not putting on
a funeral for you.

136
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,089
You are not going
to die before me.

137
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,176
I don't have to have a funeral for you
to think of the good times

138
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,303
because you are always a good boy.

139
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,600
Raiga.

140
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,684
What is it?

141
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,648
They're coming.
They'll show up anytime now.

142
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,862
Yeah... I'm excited to see
what kind of help he sought.

143
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,368
Okay! Let's save the guy.

144
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,953
Let's do it, Neji.

145
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,080
Okay.

146
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,665
Byakugan!

147
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,510
It's all right. He's still alive.

148
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,137
If we can get rid of
the guys around him,

149
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,472
we can save him.

150
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,517
Okay! Let's get rid
of them quickly!

151
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,977
-Yeah!
-Okay, let's go!

152
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,371
No...! Let me out!

153
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,720
An enemy attack!

154
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,562
You...!

155
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,273
Tenten, you take the right!

156
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,774
Okay!

157
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,746
Gentle Fist!

158
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,212
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

159
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,886
Na-ru-to...

160
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,265
Uzumaki Barrage!

161
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,399
That's the way!

162
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,276
-Watch out!
-Huh?

163
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,360
There are three more!

164
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,537
Here comes the Leaf Village's
Handsome Devil, Rock Lee!

165
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,624
I found the last one!

166
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,549
You are...

167
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,761
-Who is this guy?
-Well...

168
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,972
This is Karashi.

169
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,309
The one Grandma Sansho
was talking about...

170
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,686
This is Karashi?

171
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,984
Karashi, was it your own decision
to join the Kurosuki Family...

172
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,862
just like Grandma Sansho said it was?

173
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,781
So what if it was?

174
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,241
What?!

175
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,244
Sir Raiga is great!

176
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,913
He dethroned the old evil government
of the Katabami Gold Mine,

177
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,165
and he liberated everybody
from the village!

178
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,711
One, two, one two...

179
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:02,050
One, two, one two...

180
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,970
Umm, Grandma...

181
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,014
Oh my...
You are so greedy!

182
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:11,685
They are fighting their lives
out there by going into the gold mine...

183
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,480
Can't you just wait at least
while I'm cooking the curry?

184
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:20,777
I don't mind waiting but...
I think something is burning.

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,861
What?

186
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,822
Oh my, oh my...

187
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,491
Oops...

188
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,660
Yeah, it burned...

189
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,331
Karashi, did you know that

190
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:38,044
Grandma Sansho worries about you
everyday while cooking curry?

191
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,172
Naruto, leave things to me here.

192
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:48,388
Karashi, you saved my life
with your curry of life.

193
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,766
If you can make such
a wonderful curry,

194
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,894
how can you stay with the family of
a man with no respect for life?!

195
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,563
Why?

196
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,692
Nobody cares to compliment me
even if I can make that curry.

197
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,737
As a man born in this world,

198
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,449
I should gain more power and
try to take over the world!

199
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,161
Instead of sitting around in that store
that no one patronizes anymore.

200
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,123
What? I can't take this anymore!

201
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,132
Lee!

202
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,217
Karashi,

203
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:32,140
not only did you and
Grandma Sansho's curry save my life...

204
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,809
But you also taught me that
if you make it from the heart,

205
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,063
just one serving of curry
could save lives,

206
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:44,736
and that even somebody like me
could do anything just by trying hard.

207
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,743
You looked much stronger
and dignified then than you do now.

208
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,801
Karashi!

209
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,889
I've never seen anybody
who tries this hard.

210
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,395
I see. You want to save
this boy too, huh...

211
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:36,413
Please promise me...
Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!

212
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,377
You're right...

213
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,754
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry!

214
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,508
Oh, I'm so relieved.

215
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,928
Hey! Please get me out of here.

216
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,180
It's dark and I can't breathe.

217
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,473
Oh yeah!

218
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,394
We almost forgot
about Rokusuke.

219
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,609
Mmm? You guys...

220
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,154
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's all right now.

221
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,991
I'm sorry. Thinking that maybe

222
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,535
I could still save my friend
who got buried alive...

223
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,037
I just couldn't stay still.

224
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, I understand.

225
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,962
Neji, what is it?

226
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,850
What is this?

227
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,144
This feeling of danger...

228
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,941
Hey Neji, what is it?

229
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,528
We are being watched.
It's probably Raiga.

230
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,071
What?

231
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,740
From the top of that cliff...

232
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,992
Okay. Let's go!

233
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,245
Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.

234
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,455
All right.

235
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,882
No one's here.

236
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,051
Where did he go?

237
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,015
Mmm? What is that?

238
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,481
This mist...

239
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,656
Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!

240
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,371
Hidden Mist Jutsu...
A specialty of Mist Village Ninja.

241
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,874
So, what Guy Sensei said was true?

242
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,585
Damn, I can't see anything!

243
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,672
Neji, try to find the enemy
with your Byakugan.

244
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,549
I've been trying...!

245
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,685
Can't see a thing!

246
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,729
That's impossible.
Even Neji's Byakugan

247
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:11,401
that's supposed to let him
see 360 degrees won't work!

248
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,695
What's going on?

249
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,865
There isn't supposed to be
a Jutsu that can break Byakugan!

250
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,840
What do you think, Ranmaru?

251
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,217
It's amazing...

252
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,013
One of them can see through
the Chakra Network.

253
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,933
He probably has some sort
of Kekkei Genkai power.

254
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,227
He can see us?

255
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:50,189
It's all right,
my power is superior to his...

256
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,901
So, what are you going to do?

257
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:58,156
Everybody in the Katabami
Gold Mine is depending on me.

258
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,411
I'm the one who has to
keep the peace of this village.

259
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,830
Are you going to hold a funeral?

260
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:11,878
No, even if I hold a funeral,
I have no memories of them.

261
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,882
I'll just get rid of them!

262
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,345
Look,
Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!

263
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,148
Wh-What is it?!

264
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,198
Lighting! Drop!

265
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,085
What do you think, Ranmaru?

266
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,920
It's great, Raiga!

267
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:19,195
Crappy news pass us by

268
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,699
And you become speechless

269
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,579
My voice is way too soft

270
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,000
So you don't answer

271
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,547
You're crying Crying alone

272
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,635
What can I do? I'm crying too

273
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,929
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

274
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

275
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,230
Yeah

276
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

277
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,740
Yeah

278
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

279
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,124
Yeah

280
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:18,880
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

281
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:24,802
Yeah

282
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,317
Naruto Barrage! What?

283
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,111
Leaf Hurricane! Mm?

284
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,529
Here I come! Huh?

285
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,407
-Impossible!
-Hey! The enemy disappeared!

286
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,658
I have nobody either!

287
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,369
What? There is no enemy!

288
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,623
Neji! Are you using
your Byakugan correctly?!

289
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,957
I am doing it right!

290
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,003
It's impossible, but my Byakugan
is picking up Chakra!

291
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,672
Next time: "The Enemy of the Byakugan"
