1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:12,096
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,743
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,495
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,999
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,420
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,154
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,329
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,014
Byakugan!

17
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,945
Why did you take down Naruto
with her?!

18
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,593
It was an accident...

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,471
Had I not applied the finishing blow
to her at the moment,

20
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,265
we would've been in danger instead.

21
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,184
I know of no instance

22
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,228
of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
being defeated up until now...

23
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,981
He will be missed.

24
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,194
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
your mission is over.

25
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,530
I still haven't taken back the star.

26
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,367
We'll search for it by ourselves.
Thank you for your help.

27
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,675
Hoshikage: The Buried Truth

28
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,343
Rest easy...
I'm not an enemy.

29
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,561
Come to think of it...
What happened after I fell off the cliff?

30
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,940
Could it be...?
Did you save me, lady?

31
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,024
Yes...

32
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,416
I see.
I don't really remember, though...

33
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,419
Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.

34
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,215
I'm Naruto, a Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and...

35
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:22,304
Umm, I came to protect the star, but...

36
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,391
You kind of stole it, lady...

37
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm Natsuhi...

38
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:38,153
Natsuhi? What?
I've heard that name before...

39
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,283
That red star's sure pretty.

40
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:48,163
Natsuhiboshi...
It watches over me all the time.

41
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,292
It's the same name
as Natsuhiboshi.

42
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,460
If I remember right,

43
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,338
Sumaru said it's a star
that protects him!

44
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,924
Sumaru said that?

45
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,553
Yeah! Say, lady...
Do you know him?

46
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,517
Sumaru is my child.

47
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,479
What?! So, you're Sumaru's mom?!

48
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,442
What?! Sumaru escaped?!

49
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,741
I am very sorry.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,369
I was careless thinking
the muscle relaxants were still in effect.

51
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,458
Most likely the guys from
the Hidden Leaf

52
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,001
are the ones who took him away...

53
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,419
What do we do?

54
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,005
It'd be bad news if these circumstances
were to be known

55
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,299
by the Leaf, no,
by those in our village.

56
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,344
We've got to look high and low
for Sumaru right away.

57
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,972
There's no need to get rattled...

58
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:51,310
We can take care of them at
our leisure after we find the star.

59
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,688
I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden
in the Leaves something like

60
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,524
they died during the mission...

61
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,777
We could also convince Sumaru.

62
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,988
I burned Natsuhi's Chakra
into my memory...

63
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,326
We'll reach the star if we follow the
remnants of her Chakra.

64
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,209
Naruto was...?

65
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,588
Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi
who stole the star.

66
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,592
But I didn't see them
in the Valley of Death...

67
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,969
Are you saying they escaped from
the valley

68
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,179
where the poison gas swirls?

69
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,264
Perhaps.

70
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,891
If that's the case,

71
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,228
they might have crossed the border
and escaped safely to the forest...

72
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,688
Hey, let's all look for them!

73
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,692
What's the deal, guys?!

74
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,904
Naruto helped all of you,
didn't he?!

75
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,991
But if we don't have an order
from Lord Akahoshi...

76
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,119
Right?
Yeah...

77
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,915
We don't have time to be waiting
for an order! I'm going!

78
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,085
I'm going...

79
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,841
I'll go too, if it's to look for Naruto.

80
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,426
Mizura, you can't.

81
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,429
I want to be useful in some way.

82
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,684
No... I'll go.

83
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,067
Sumaru?!

84
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,277
You're okay!

85
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,488
We safely rescued him from
the Hoshikage's medical room

86
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,282
where he was being held!

87
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,575
What?

88
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,869
Why was he in
Lord Hoshikage's medical room?

89
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,080
It wasn't a Ninja from
some other village

90
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,500
who knocked you all out
and took Sumaru away!

91
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:59,146
Akahoshi, the leader of your village
was the culprit!

92
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,856
In other words, the Shinobi
who made off with the star

93
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,401
and the Shinobi who attacked all
of you were different people.

94
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,364
That's what Neji deduced
word for word.

95
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,659
Why would Lord Akahoshi...?

96
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,286
Why would he do that to us?

97
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,914
What does this mean, Sumaru?

98
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,707
I don't know, either!

99
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,878
But it seems Lord Akahoshi
is hiding something from us...

100
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,839
Isn't it about time you guys realized it?

101
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,842
Akahoshi's using you as he pleases.

102
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,433
Mizura is not the exception.

103
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,435
If you guys continue
training this way,

104
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,771
everyone will collapse and then...

105
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,648
No way...

106
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,274
It can't be. That's a lie!

107
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,985
Lord Akahoshi is not that
kind of person, ever!

108
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,576
Perhaps the Shinobi
who stole the star will tell the truth.

109
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,747
Let's find the Shinobi who disappeared,
whatever the cost!

110
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,209
The forest in the Land of Bears
is deep.

111
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,711
If only outsiders go,
they'd just get lost.

112
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,882
Okay, work with us.

113
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,636
So leave this to me.

114
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,720
But...

115
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,348
You rest now.

116
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,893
At some point, the time will come
when we'll need your help.

117
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
How about it, Akahoshi...?

118
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,018
Were you able to get a lead on
the remnants of Natsuhi's Chakra?

119
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,705
This is good.

120
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,416
I guess this is what's called
good old home-cooking.

121
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,419
There's more.

122
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,213
One more bowl!

123
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:38,555
But why'd you do something like
steal the star, Sumaru's mom?

124
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,851
This is not the first and only time
I took that away.

125
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,644
Ten years ago as well...

126
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,271
Huh...?

127
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,151
Training utilizing that star was painful
for many Shinobi at the time

128
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,111
and even caused many deaths.

129
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,701
My husband Hotarubi and I
who survived the training...

130
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:06,375
thought to seal the star to prevent
any more victims

131
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,754
due to the training.

132
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,771
A Tracking Unit immediately caught up
with us after we had stolen the star.

133
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,040
Hold it!

134
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,176
Lord Third Hoshikage...

135
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,557
Hotarubi...Natsuhi...
Your thoughts are reasonable...

136
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,518
As it happens, I was also wavering.

137
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,605
But in the position of Hoshikage,
it was difficult to make a decision.

138
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,693
I promise to terminate
the star training.

139
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,611
But the hard-line faction
of the Star Village

140
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,073
might at some point
resume the training...

141
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,159
You two must leave this village!

142
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,162
I want you to keep an eye on
the village from the outside.

143
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:31,251
And if it seems that the training
will begin once again...

144
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,753
Please stop it with
your power.

145
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,047
Lord Hoshikage...

146
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,475
For Sumaru...

147
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:05,494
Tell Sumaru that...we died.
Please be good to him.

148
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,370
Yes, I understand.

149
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,458
Upon allowing us to leave the village,

150
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:16,129
the Lord Third Hoshikage completely
prohibited the star training.

151
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,467
Like us, the Third Hoshikage
was also distressed

152
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,970
at the damage from
the star training.

153
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,056
Neji was also talking about that.

154
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,642
But are the effects from
the star that severe?!

155
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,480
Yes. My husband Hotarubi died
due to side effects

156
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,691
a while after leaving the village...

157
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:41,112
I might also die at any time
from the effects.

158
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,490
No way...

159
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,162
Then let's go back to
the village!

160
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,290
Tell Akahoshi directly to
stop the training!

161
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,002
Akahoshi is a man who puts
the prosperity of the village

162
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,964
ahead of the lives of
the children.

163
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,425
As proof of that,
he has taken Sumaru hostage

164
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,761
and has demanded that
I return the star.

165
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,848
What?! Then the masked Ninja
from that time was...

166
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,687
Hold it!

167
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,813
Farewell!

168
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,481
Wh-What?!

169
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,946
It was Akahoshi?!

170
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,585
What is it, Sumaru's mom?

171
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,338
They've...
Akahoshi has come.

172
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,228
Is this the place?

173
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,939
Where's the star being hidden?

174
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,624
Hotarubi... Please protect
the star, protect Sumaru...

175
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,475
The star is under that rock...

176
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,520
But it seems the entrance
is sealed...

177
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,859
What can we do with
a boulder like this...?

178
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,322
Our only choice is to blow it up
little by little with Letter Bombs.

179
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,118
I won't let you do that!

180
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,211
Wha...?!

181
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,172
Didn't this brat die in
the Valley of Death?

182
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,593
I won't be done in just like that,
believe it!

183
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,721
You guys step back.

184
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,600
Then I just have to do it again.

185
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,397
Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!

186
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,072
Here we go!

187
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,314
You're mine!

188
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,867
I saw that move coming!

189
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,870
Become a sacrifice for my beast!

190
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,049
What?!

191
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,516
Natsuhi... So you were alive too,
after all, huh?

192
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,520
Akahoshi, reconsider one more time...

193
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,566
If you stop the star training
and release the children,

194
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,985
I'll have no more to do
with the village...

195
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,321
I don't think so!

196
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,201
The Third Hoshikage was stubborn

197
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,244
and never wavered
in his opposition.

198
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,581
Opposition to those of us
who trained Star Ninja

199
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,459
and attempted to bring prosperity
to the village...

200
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,383
No! As long as I,
the Third Hoshikage, am alive,

201
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,553
the resumption of that training
will never be allowed!

202
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,725
Return to your posts... That is all.

203
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,119
Have you lost your mind...

204
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,914
Akahoshi?

205
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,001
You're the one who's lost his mind!

206
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,671
Rest easy and go to
the other world...

207
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,507
Our generation will
raise this village

208
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,011
to rival that of
the Five Great Hidden Villages...

209
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,482
Was this...really okay?

210
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,027
It was necessary for the sake
of the village, right?

211
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:19,075
Exactly! We can do star training
as we please.

212
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,292
Unforgivable!

213
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,253
What do you think of all those
who are training frantically,

214
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,546
believing in you guys?!

215
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,465
One's even on the verge of dying!
Do you understand that?!

216
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,761
Sacrifice is unavoidable for
the sake of village prosperity.

217
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,432
A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.

218
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,476
For the sake of village prosperity?

219
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,644
Knock it off!

220
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,355
All you're doing is deceiving
the people in the village!

221
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,569
This is a Star Village issue...
I will settle this.

222
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
B-But...!

223
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,614
Step back!

224
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,498
Yotaka, Shisou!

225
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,433
Wha...?! He devoured
his comrades' Chakra!

226
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,359
My Chakra beast has a full stomach.

227
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,611
Things won't go as they did before.

228
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,113
Talk is cheap!

229
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,574
Sumaru's mom...

230
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:16,401
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

231
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,408
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

232
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,673
Yellow Moon.

233
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:45,513
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

234
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:50,768
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

235
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:57,692
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

236
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:04,532
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

237
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:11,247
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

238
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:18,087
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

239
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:25,011
A magical chord change, in a restless city

240
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,976
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

241
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,817
Neji, how's Sumaru's mom doing?

242
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,277
She's stable for now,

243
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,695
but her condition can worsen
at any moment.

244
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,572
What?
Her Chakra Network that

245
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,865
had already been weakened

246
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,867
due to the side-effects of the star
before she received Akahoshi's attack.

247
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,869
In other words,
her Chakra Network is all beat up?

248
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,622
Hey, Granny Tsunade
could heal her, right?

249
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,208
I don't know.
But either way,

250
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,834
if she were to use
the Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,

251
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,419
there's no guarantee she'll live.

252
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,839
Next time:
"Reunion: The Remaining Time"
