1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,517
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,447
Sasuke!

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,126
You punk!

22
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,469
What's with...this guy?

23
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,595
Why...?

24
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,057
Damn it...

25
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,478
Is this the best you've got...?

26
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:31,443
If this is all you've got,
I still don't need to use that...

27
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,320
What?

28
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:39,118
You haven't realized it?
I...haven't used my Sharingan.

29
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,580
Don't mock me!

30
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,463
You don't have enough strength or desire...

31
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,801
You are weak.

32
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:03,225
Why you are weak?
Because you don't have enough...hatred.

33
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,687
If I kept playing comrade with you guys...

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,861
I wouldn't have...been able to get...

35
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,242
...this much power!

36
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,797
That's right...I need ...

37
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:40,721
Both power...and hatred...
in order to catch up with him.

38
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,938
Brothers: Distance Among the Uchiha

39
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,902
Big Brother...I'll get off.

40
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,488
Don't push it...

41
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,781
Okay...

42
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,159
What's up?

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,204
This is the place...
where Father works, right?

44
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,416
Yeah...The headquarters
of the Leaf Police Force.

45
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,211
I was curious about it from before,

46
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:17,341
but why's the Uchiha Clan crest
on the Police Force mark?

47
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,177
Oh... so you noticed, huh?

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,387
Of course...

49
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:26,392
Yeah...Let me see... To put it simply...

50
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,895
it seems the previous generations
of the Uchiha Clan

51
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,606
set up and established the Police Force.

52
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,070
So they used their own crest for
the symbol mark of this organization.

53
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,198
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has always been

54
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,201
in charge of protecting
the public and the peace of this village.

55
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,289
The Uchiha crest is
a testament to the proud clan.

56
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,420
The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.

57
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,298
But even now, nearly all members
belong to this first force here.

58
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,676
and contribute to maintaining
peace in the village.

59
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,264
Only even more exceptional Shinobi
can crack down on the crimes

60
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,683
committed by Shinobi, so...

61
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,479
Sure enough, father's awesome!

62
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,899
Are you going to enter
the Police Force, too?

63
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,736
Well...I'm not sure...

64
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,029
Why not?!

65
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,700
When I grow up, I'm also going
to enter the Police Force, so!

66
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:28,162
Father's also coming to
tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

67
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,164
It's the first step to my dream.

68
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,665
That's right.

69
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,134
You're late...What were you doing?

70
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,719
Father...

71
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,139
I have something to talk to you about.
Come quickly.

72
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,315
That's my boy.

73
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,360
You've come this far just half a year
after being promoted to Chunin.

74
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,990
About tomorrow's special mission...

75
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,284
I've decided to go with you, too.

76
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,328
Tomorrow?

77
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,332
If you complete this mission, Itachi...

78
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,460
your entrance into
the Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!

79
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,881
You understand, right?

80
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,805
You don't have to be so worried.
More importantly...

81
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,601
Umm... Father...

82
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,520
Tomorrow's my...

83
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,232
Tomorrow's mission will be
a very important mission not just for you,

84
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,984
but for the Uchiha Clan!

85
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,701
I'm quitting tomorrow's mission, after all.

86
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,205
What're you doing talking insanity?!

87
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,834
You should know how important
a day tomorrow is!

88
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,507
I'm going to Sasuke's Academy
entrance ceremony tomorrow...

89
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:10,055
The general rule is for relatives
to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.

90
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,392
There was the notice, right... Father?

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,816
I get it already. I'll go to the Academy...

92
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,321
Your left leg...

93
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,739
Be sure to ice it.

94
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,868
Right...

95
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,290
Big Brother... He's so distant...

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,421
Entrance Ceremony

97
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,426
Everyone! Congratulations
on your entrance!

98
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,514
From here on, please work very hard
towards striving for the Shinobi path.

99
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,102
And I'd like you to bring further prosperity
to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.

100
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:05,944
Gee... I remember
the time when Itachi entered.

101
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,529
Just what I'd expect from his brother.

102
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,950
Thank you for your help with both boys.

103
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,953
Oh, it's nothing like that.

104
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,915
The first prodigy since the beginning
of the Academy...

105
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,126
There were no students
as exceptional as that boy.

106
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,545
That's a bit too much praise.

107
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,880
Not at all...

108
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,841
I'm hopeful for you, too.

109
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,803
Become a fine Shinobi
like your big brother.

110
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,682
Yes.

111
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,649
Hey...That's Uchiha, right?

112
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,942
Yeah.

113
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,361
I wonder...if he's awesome, too.

114
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,738
Hmm...Must be.

115
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:57,037
Recess at last! What a drag.
I'm still not used to this place...

116
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,705
You want some too, Shikamaru?

117
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,918
I mean, all of your recesses
have become meal times.

118
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,146
That's my boy...

119
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,233
I've great confidence
you'll make it great in Anbu.

120
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,368
This won't do! Won't do!

121
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,091
I've got a long way...to go...

122
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,179
Really...

123
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,558
You should rest your body
on your days off at least.

124
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,020
You don't have to push it.

125
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,608
I heard...that Big Brother graduated
from the Academy in just one year.

126
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,570
The times are different, then and now.

127
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,241
Besides, that kid is a bit special, so...

128
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,370
That's my boy...

129
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,671
Now, I'm going to hand out
the report cards for the first half.

130
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,927
Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy
Ninjutsu: 1st in class and academy

131
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,012
Individual rank: 1st in class and academy
Team rank: 1st in class and academy

132
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,480
Do a fine job in this vein like
your big brother.

133
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:03,747
Father... I wanted you to say,
"That's my boy," to me...

134
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,959
What did you say?

135
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,087
What do you mean you can't participate
in the assembly tomorrow?!

136
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,925
You don't understand your own position!

137
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,722
I'm setting out on a mission tomorrow.

138
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,393
What're they doing this late
at night with the lights off?

139
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,894
What mission?!

140
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,857
I can't say... It's a top secret mission.

141
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:41,743
Itachi...You also have the role
of the pipe which connects the clan

142
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,829
with the keystone of the village.

143
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,456
You know that, don't you?

144
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,625
Yeah...

145
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:54,548
Keep that well in mind!
And come to tomorrow's assembly!

146
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,594
Sasuke...

147
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,931
Get to bed after
you've gone to the bathroom.

148
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,434
Right...

149
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,396
What're you doing hanging around
this late at night? Get to bed!

150
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,773
Okay.

151
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,990
Report Card

152
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,911
Father only thinks about you, Big Brother...

153
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,914
Am I loathsome to you?

154
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,836
It's okay.

155
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,799
It's logical for Shinobi to be
ill-thought of by people, so...

156
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,718
That's not how I feel...

157
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:47,934
Brother's right.
I really do...think ill of him...

158
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,606
Excellence is not easy at all.

159
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:57,569
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant.

160
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,239
Even if you're coveted
and sought after at first.

161
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,160
But, we only have each other for siblings.

162
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:10,624
I will continue to exist with you
as a wall you must get over...

163
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,796
Even if I'm ill-thought of...
That's what a big brother is.

164
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,465
Is Itachi home?!

165
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,926
I have something to
talk to you about. Come out!

166
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,933
Why's everyone gathered here?

167
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,895
There are two people who didn't come
to yesterday's assembly.

168
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,105
Why didn't you come?!

169
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,779
He didn't go to the assembly Father
was talking about last night, after all.

170
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,697
I understand that when you enter Anbu,

171
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:46,451
you get roped into various
troublesome things.

172
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,996
Your father also said something
like that in your defense.

173
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,668
But for us, we don't intend
to treat you special.

174
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,506
Understood. I shall be careful next time.

175
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,883
Now I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

176
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:08,098
Right... But before that,
there's a little more I want to ask you...

177
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:15,272
It's about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself
into the Nakano River to kill himself.

178
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,941
Threw himself?!

179
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,945
The other person who didn't come
to the assembly is that Shisui.

180
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:27,117
As I recall, you adored him
like a real older brother.

181
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,331
I see... I hadn't seen him at all recently.

182
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,500
That's too bad.

183
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:46,177
And we the Police Force have decided
to launch an all-out investigation.

184
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,179
Investigation?!

185
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,350
This is the will Shisui wrote.

186
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,978
The analysis of the handwriting
has been completed.

187
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,522
No mistake, he did indeed write it.

188
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,026
If there are no murder leads,
then what's the investigation?

189
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,072
It'd be easy for a person who can use
Sharingan to copy handwriting, you see...

190
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,120
The most adept Uchiha.

191
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,373
The man feared as Shisui,
"the Instantaneous Man."

192
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,792
He was a man who would take
the lead no matter what the mission

193
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,128
if it was for the sake of the clan.

194
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,838
It's tough to think that

195
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,091
such a man would leave something
like this and kill himself.

196
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:30,305
You shouldn't judge people...
only on looks and speculation.

197
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,767
For the time being,
I leave the will with you.

198
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,688
Take that and you request cooperation
in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.

199
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,024
Understood...

200
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,071
I hope we get a lead.

201
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,492
Also, we have a different route
to Anbu Black Ops.

202
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,163
We'll know right away if you do something
like crushing the investigation request.

203
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,543
Why don't you just come right out
and say it?

204
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,674
You suspect me, right?

205
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,635
Yeah. That's right, you little punk...

206
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,804
Listen up, Itachi.

207
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,682
Just try doing something
like betraying the clan and...

208
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,100
it'll cost you!

209
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,611
I told you before.

210
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:31,658
You shouldn't judge people...
only on looks and speculation.

211
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,704
It's because you take the liberty to
judge me as patient and take me lightly.

212
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,998
Clan...Clan...

213
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,253
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own vessels

214
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,924
and don't know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there...

215
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,885
I've never seen him like this...

216
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,016
Shisui...was monitoring you recently...

217
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,519
Half a year after entering Anbu...

218
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:04,441
the strangeness of your behavior
couldn't be overlooked.

219
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,360
What the hell are you thinking?

220
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:12,949
Fixated on the organization,
fixated on the clan, fixated on the name.

221
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:18,580
It's a dreadful thing that constrains oneself
and labels one's own vessel.

222
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,248
And it's a foolish thing...

223
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:24,085
that fear and hate...
what one has never seen or known...

224
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,587
Stop, Itachi!

225
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,465
What the hell's the matter with you?!

226
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,427
Itachi...
You've been a little strange lately.

227
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,848
I'm not strange at all.

228
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,393
I'm carrying out my own role... That's it.

229
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,730
Then why didn't you come last night?

230
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,026
In order to elevate myself higher...

231
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,570
What're you talking about...?

232
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:04,417
My vessel is dismayed
at this foolish clan!

233
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,713
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has all along

234
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,342
been in charge protecting
the peace of this village.

235
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:18,223
The Uchiha crest is a testament
to the proud clan.

236
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,350
That's my boy...

237
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,394
I've great confidence
you'll do great in Anbu Black Ops.

238
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,899
Because you're fixated
on insignificant things like clans...

239
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,944
you lose sight of what's truly important.

240
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,489
True change cannot be made if stuck
within the restrictions of regulations,

241
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,659
and constrained predictions
and imagination...

242
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,619
Saying such arrogant things!

243
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:45,083
Enough! You'll be imprisoned
if you say any more foolish nonsense.

244
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,839
Excellence is not easy at all.

245
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:55,176
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant...

246
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,055
even if you're coveted
and sought after at first...

247
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,308
Why... Big Brother...?

248
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,561
What do you say?!

249
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,315
I can't tolerate it anymore...
Captain, order imprisonment!

250
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,985
Big Brother! Stop it already!

251
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,289
I'm not the one who killed Shisui.

252
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:28,585
But I apologize for
my numerous slips of the tongue.

253
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,878
I'm very sorry...

254
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,011
Recently, it seems he's been up
to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions

255
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,804
and was a little tired...

256
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,014
Captain!

257
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,893
The Anbu Black Ops is a force
under the direct control of Lord Hokage...

258
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,606
Even we the Police Force can't arrest him,
if we don't have an arrest warrant.

259
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,484
And as for Itachi...

260
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,529
I will take the responsibility
and monitor him.

261
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,032
Please...

262
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,663
Understood...

263
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,113
With this, you've woken up, right?

264
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,244
We had a hindrance back at that time...

265
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,624
But it won't be like that this time.

266
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:57,799
I'll show you...
the true power of Sharingan.

267
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:15,400
When I recalled the parts one by one,

268
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,906
I felt as though
I had understood everything

269
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

270
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:33,084
which I kept so close to me

271
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,172
Speechless nights,

272
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,552
a hint of warmth,

273
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:49,183
and this distant yearning for you

274
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,186
I live,

275
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,984
simply repeating this cycle

276
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:06,868
Held in my two hands

277
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,246
A droplet of time

278
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:17,837
Softly clutching forgotten memories

279
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,715
Lost words

280
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,186
I'll keep these thoughts...

281
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,735
Give me all you've got, Naruto.

282
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,156
Or is this all you've got?

283
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:50,328
You were talking impudently
about your Way of Ninja

284
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,538
and this is all you've got?

285
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:58,211
You've gotta be kidding! Right now,
you're not even worth beating!

286
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,214
