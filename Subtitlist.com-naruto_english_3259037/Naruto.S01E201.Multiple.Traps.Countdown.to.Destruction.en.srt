1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,920
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,096
Multiple Traps!
Countdown to Destruction

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,142
This many Paper Bombs...
is a diversion?

18
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,769
Y-Yes!

19
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,937
No way...

20
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,524
No. He's a man who
would go that far...

21
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,901
After all, he is Genno
the trap practitioner!

22
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:59,078
Remember. Think.
His actions thus far...

23
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,205
His intent hidden in there.

24
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,214
First he steals the blueprints
for key facilities in the village

25
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,092
and pretends to blow himself up
in front of the Anbu Black Ops.

26
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,762
Because of the incident,

27
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,348
an S-Level Emergency
Security Alert is given...

28
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,394
The village becomes poorly manned...

29
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,729
and Genno is able to
move around as he pleases...

30
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,402
Then why did he scatter
the blueprints he stole?

31
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,530
With this incident, it becomes evident
that Genno might still be alive

32
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,949
so the guys on watch outside
end up returning

33
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,993
to the village as quickly possible...

34
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,581
Could that have been his objective?

35
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,877
He directed everyone's attention
to the Paper Bombs

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,254
and reassembled
the village Shinobi.

37
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,133
If his aim is to
set up something there...

38
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,889
Could it be...?

39
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,645
The Paper Bombs in the village
were a decoy?

40
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,525
You can't see the Paper Bombs
in this room?

41
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,655
What's this?!

42
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,910
What's up with these Paper Bombs?

43
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,121
Do you know the geological conditions

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,290
of the Mountainside Images?

45
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,542
G-Geological conditions...?

46
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,378
To be precise, the geological condition
of this plateau

47
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,505
which the Mountainside Images
are carved into.

48
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,926
The plateau towering behind
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

49
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,511
is made of extremely hard rock.

50
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:44,016
But this rock has narrow lines
running through it, you see...

51
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,480
It can be easily broken if power
is applied along those lines.

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,525
The Mountainside Images
were created using this...

53
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,570
This time and thirty years ago

54
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,530
aren't the only times I've come
to the Leaf...

55
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,993
I've visited the Leaf several times
and checked things out...

56
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,996
And then I finally determined it...

57
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:11,835
I determined how to set Paper Bombs
to destroy this plateau!

58
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,671
Wha...?!

59
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,089
I'm fairly certain
no one would imagine

60
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,341
the destruction of
the Mountainside Images...

61
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,801
Especially when

62
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,261
we're in the middle of Paper Bomb
removal operations.

63
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,555
We wouldn't even think
about the Mountainside Images...

64
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,061
But if that entire plateau were
to slide down and crumble...

65
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,939
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

66
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,080
would be completely buried
in earth and sand!

67
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,251
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

68
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,669
It would be destroyed!

69
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,090
Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage
immediately!

70
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,724
Make sure the guys who return
don't enter the village...

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,394
Shikamaru, be happy!

72
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,355
Guy Sensei and the others
have come back!

73
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,777
Hurry, hurry!
Now that Might Guy has returned,

74
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,864
we won't let the enemy do
as he pleases!

75
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,241
Too late, huh...?

76
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,577
What's the matter...?

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,121
Shikamaru!

78
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,748
Naruto has...!

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,046
Why...? Why destroy
the whole village...?

80
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,883
If you do that,
many innocent people will die.

81
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,596
And all the buildings you built
will be destroyed.

82
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,930
Is that what you want?!

83
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,812
You may think revenge is
your last job or whatever,

84
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,398
but something like
this is absolutely mistaken.

85
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,528
If you're going to go through
with this no matter what...

86
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,322
I'll stop you!

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,160
That's impossible.

88
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,621
No way will I let you detonate
the Paper Bombs!

89
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,751
Nope. I won from the moment
you set foot in here.

90
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,086
Even if you defeat me,

91
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,340
the triggering device will activate
the instant you leave this place.

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,026
It seems everyone has returned...

93
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,822
I guess I'll be activating
the triggring device...

94
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,034
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
shall meet

95
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,663
the same fate as Kagero Village!

96
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,790
I won't let that happen!

97
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,417
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

98
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,128
It's over!

99
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,548
It's useless to resist...

100
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,806
It's impossible for you alone
to disarm all of my traps.

101
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,811
No doubt, it might be impossible
for me alone...

102
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,521
but I've got friends!

103
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:25,404
But didn't you do nothing
but badmouth them at Ichiraku?

104
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:30,742
Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot
and they tick me off sometimes...

105
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,494
But they're my friends!

106
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,332
They're Shinobi
who will protect the Leaf with me!

107
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,294
No matter what traps you set...

108
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,088
they'll manage somehow,
no matter what!

109
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,301
Then, I'll finish everything before that.

110
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,927
You can't defend yourself against this!

111
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,680
Fang Over Fang...!

112
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,894
I'd say that was a close save, huh?

113
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,855
Kiba! Akamaru!
How'd you know I was here...?

114
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,316
Thank Hinata!

115
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,819
She thought it was strange that
you'd leave for no reason,

116
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,530
so she frantically searched
for you with her Byakugan.

117
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,202
But the Byakugan shouldn't
be that versatile...

118
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,412
I'm surprised you found us...

119
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,874
Well, we had a pretty good idea
of where you were...

120
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,337
Shikamaru said that the final trap
would be in the Mountainside Images.

121
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,671
Shikamaru did...?

122
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,506
I see...

123
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,844
This means I shouldn't take
young opponents lightly, huh...?

124
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,765
Right. You misjudged our power...

125
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,726
Th-These are...insects?!

126
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,688
That's right...
You're finished now.

127
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,152
Get down, you two!

128
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,408
Old man...

129
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,369
He blew himself up!

130
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,870
No, that's not it!

131
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,249
It's a Substitution...

132
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,962
It seems he switched just before
being covered with the insects...

133
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,180
It's over now...

134
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,434
Wh-What's this...?

135
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,567
It's the Shadow Suffocating Jutsu...

136
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,486
You anticipated my actions...?

137
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,241
Yup. Checkmate, old man.
Come on right over here...

138
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,001
Choji, restrain him.

139
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,252
Got it...

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,505
Oh, shoot! His shadow...!

141
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,301
Shikamaru... What did he do...?

142
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,386
He had set it so a smoke screen
would activate

143
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,888
if he were touched by an enemy.

144
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,807
Choji, to the right!

145
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,351
Human Boulder!

146
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,854
The Leaf is now finished!

147
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,858
A strike?

148
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,572
Why won't...
the Paper Bomb explode?

149
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,574
Tough luck...

150
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,493
We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.

151
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,371
And we disarmed all
the triggering devices

152
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,123
set inside the Mountainside Images.

153
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,210
This is as far as you go old man...

154
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,796
That's right...
Prepare yourself!

155
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,423
It's useless to run!

156
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,427
I don't know how incredible of
a trap practitioner you are.

157
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,097
But my friends' teamwork
is better than you are!

158
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,976
I must not give up here...

159
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,145
Give up, already!

160
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,690
No matter what you set up,
we'll stop it!

161
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:52,402
I wouldn't be able...
to show my face to my son...

162
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,284
Where'd he...

163
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,494
Over there!

164
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,707
It seems you haven't disarmed
all of the triggering devices...

165
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,128
I...win!

166
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,103
The village!

167
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,775
Don't be fooled, guys!
This is a Genjutsu!

168
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,236
Dispel!

169
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,696
Naruto!

170
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,866
Huh? Wh-What?

171
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,958
Summoning Jutsu!

172
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,586
He's planning to get on that bird
and escape!

173
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,004
Leave it to me!

174
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,965
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

175
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,930
All right! It's a success...

176
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,729
– Ino...!
– Hey!

177
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,440
Why'd you break the Jutsu?!

178
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,732
What's the matter?

179
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:18,155
His body... It really hurt...

180
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,576
He's fighting while enduring
a lot of pain in his body!

181
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,165
I won't let you escape!

182
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,188
Naruto...

183
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,564
Sure enough...

184
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:57,235
I'm no match for a young person
at Taijutsu, huh...?

185
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,696
It's not like that...

186
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,117
You're a quite the practitioner
of Taijutsu...

187
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,953
Now it's finally over!

188
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,623
It's not over yet...

189
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:10,957
What?

190
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,211
What do you mean...
it's not over yet?

191
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,422
Where's the bird he summoned earlier?

192
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,799
Oh! Over there!

193
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,432
There are Paper Bombs on its feet!

194
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,934
What?!

195
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,604
The Mountainside Image of
the Third Hokage is the spot

196
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,148
where I restored a crack...

197
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,861
I used a device different
from the others...

198
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,534
That cracked section is slightly
more fragile than the other areas...

199
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,912
I set an triggering device
that takes advantage of that...

200
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,290
If there an explosion occurs there,

201
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:58,129
the other Paper Bombs
will explode at once.

202
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,840
Going so far as to set a device
in such a place...

203
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,425
To think we overlooked that...!

204
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:09,057
That means he summoned
that bird to activate the device?!

205
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:14,521
At last...my wish will come true...

206
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,190
Here it comes!
I'll use this...

207
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,363
It dodged it!

208
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,199
We can't bring it down with
a long-range attack?!

209
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,119
I'll defend the Leaf,
no matter what!

210
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,625
I'll blow him away with the Rasengan
before he slams into this place!

211
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,627
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

212
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,923
What?!

213
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,300
What?!

214
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,097
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
Both arms!

215
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,309
Naruto, use my hands!

216
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,561
Thanks, Choji!

217
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,026
H-Hinata?!

218
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,947
U-Umm...Shikamaru told me to read
that bird's movements

219
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,950
with my Byakugan
and to give you directions...

220
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,160
Huh...?

221
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,870
I leave the rest to you!

222
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,122
All right, let's go, Hinata!

223
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,583
R-Right!

224
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,543
Byakugan!

225
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,298
Not yet... Draw it closer...

226
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,425
It'll be okay.

227
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,635
No matter what,

228
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:31,264
I'll protect the village the Third Hokage
risked his life to protect!

229
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,892
Naruto... Now!

230
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,103
Rasengan!

231
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,522
It vanished?!
Up above!

232
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,485
Damn it. Reach!

233
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,113
You little!

234
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,086
What? Did something happen...?

235
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,839
All right!

236
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,639
Yes! We did it, Hinata!

237
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,226
N-Naruto...

238
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,566
The inside of his body
is in terrible shape...

239
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,904
It's amazing that he lived until today.

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,366
Old man...

241
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:38,581
It's too bad...
I failed to leave my name in history...

242
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,044
But...I had...fun...

243
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,546
What?

244
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,846
What do you mean, old man?!

245
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,016
What do you mean you had fun?!

246
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,310
Old Man Genno!

247
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,446
Naruto?
No, it's not...

248
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,618
"My son proud as a peacock having
beaten me at treasure hunting..."

249
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,413
Treasure hunting...?

250
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,623
Did you notice...?

251
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,833
Huh?

252
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,212
The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty
in this incident...

253
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,511
Old Man Genno!
Open your eyes!

254
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,139
Old Man Genno!

255
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,353
I figured it out, Shikamaru...

256
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,649
It seems the person in this picture
is Genno's real son...

257
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,485
Son...?

258
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,154
It seems he became
a Shinobi like his father...

259
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:56,284
but lost his life right after that
when the Leaf invaded Kagero Village.

260
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,998
I bet he wanted to avenge his own son...

261
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,501
So he did something like this...

262
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:10,298
No doubt, at first he may have
infiltrated the village for revenge...

263
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,801
At first...?

264
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,553
Something was kind of bugging me,

265
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,014
so I checked out the triggering device
that was set in the Academy

266
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,724
one more time.

267
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,895
There was a loose connection
in one spot.

268
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,856
It was set up so it wouldn't activate
even if the target were hit...

269
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,860
Wasn't that just Genno's mistake...?

270
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,530
Genno was a first-rate trap practitioner.

271
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,158
It's unlikely he'd make such
a simple mistake...

272
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,662
No doubt about it...

273
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,331
The same goes for the traps in
the Mountainside Images...

274
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,670
There were some defective bombs
mixed in with the Paper Bombs.

275
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,506
Even if the traps were activated,

276
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,758
there's a strong possibility that

277
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,511
they'd only make a few cracks
in the Mountain Images.

278
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,851
Then he had no serious intention
of smashing the Leaf?

279
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,311
Then...for what purpose...?

280
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,609
Treasure hunting...

281
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,613
What do you mean treasure hunting?

282
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,909
It makes more sense
to think of it like that.

283
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,789
In other words, he infiltrated
the village for the sake of revenge,

284
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,292
but he changed his mind
after meeting Naruto

285
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,210
who was a spitting image
of his son...

286
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,174
He probably knew that
he didn't have long to live.

287
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,469
If he was going to do something
before dying,

288
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,555
he wanted it to be
the thing he found most fun...

289
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:45,184
He probably wanted to re-enact
his treasure-hunts with his son...

290
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,521
using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.

291
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,565
So that's what it was.

292
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,736
Well, it's just conjecture, though.

293
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,323
So that old man...
wasn't a bad person...

294
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,033
I told you from the start.

295
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:04,412
Those who like Ichiraku's ramen
can't be bad people!

296
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,625
What? But in actuality,
didn't he hate ramen?

297
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,169
Ichiraku ramen is different!

298
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:17,675
There's no way you can keep
eating something you hate every day.

299
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,052
Exactly!

300
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,475
Old man...

301
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,353
Naruto...?

302
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,612
The enemies who come to the Leaf
won't always be like this.

303
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,200
Someone like Orochimaru
might attack again!

304
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,162
That means we must
always be prepared!

305
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,830
Right!

306
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,084
It's a pain, though...

307
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,294
I'll eat in preparation for that!

308
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:59,425
We'll protect the Leaf Village!

309
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,012
With all of us working together...

310
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,914
On a checkerboard night

311
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,625
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

312
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:37,630
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

313
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,967
Suggestively

314
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,346
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

315
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:51,686
The Trombone gradually going off-key

316
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,065
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

317
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:03,072
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

318
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:08,661
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

319
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,816
Thank you all for your support!

320
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,568
We're going to fill the airwaves
with our appreciation...

321
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,944
We've even called on someone
who hasn't been in the show recently

322
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,321
to make a guest appearance!

323
