1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,845
The Promise That Could Not Be Kept

21
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,314
Kakashi Sensei...

22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,276
Where's Sasuke?

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,868
Kakashi!

24
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,746
How is Naruto Uzumaki's condition?

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,122
He's okay.

26
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,085
What about Sasuke? Where's Sasuke Uchiha?!

27
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,643
How are the other Genin?

28
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,688
Yes! By Lady Hokage's order,

29
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,356
the first and second medical corps
have been dispatched...

30
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,609
The wounded from all areas have
already been gathered.

31
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:34,321
They were convoyed after
administering emergency treatment.

32
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,781
How are their conditions?

33
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,993
Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries...

34
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,330
Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,
but it's not life-threatening.

35
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:47,793
Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi
are in serious condition...

36
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,337
At this point,
there's no telling what will happen.

37
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,520
Everyone...

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,460
The ingredients and
effects of the medicine

39
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,337
have been thoroughly researched.

40
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,464
Excellent...

41
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,050
Now bring the deer antler!

42
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,176
Yes, ma'am!

43
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,099
How is he...Big Sister?

44
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,901
No walks for him for quite a while...

45
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,653
The muscles of his limbs
have been severely damaged.

46
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,781
You're a vet, right, Big Sister?
Can't you somehow...?

47
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,491
It'll be okay.

48
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,620
It'll take time. But there's no threat
to his life, so rest easy.

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,584
Walks for you are out of the question
for quite a while, too!

50
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,254
Yeah, I know...

51
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,052
Intensive Care Unit 7

52
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,189
It'll soon be three hours...
Please take over.

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,440
All right!

54
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,694
Although we're making
this kid's hair into a conductor,

55
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,571
please don't mistake the cellular rate
of the deficient parts!

56
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,699
Right!

57
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,535
As for the Chakra control, handle it
as if we're threading a needle!

58
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,744
Understood!

59
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,924
Intensive Care Unit 6

60
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,729
There's no point in
you getting frustrated, right?

61
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,274
Missions come with sacrifice...

62
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,401
You took the mental training, right?

63
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,907
Training and actual battle
are different, you know...

64
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,286
I know what missions are about...

65
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:32,291
And I thought I knew what
the Shinobi world is like.

66
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:38,255
I became a platoon leader
for the first time on this mission.

67
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,507
With that, I understood...

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,969
I'm not cut out to be a Shinobi.

69
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,392
Surprisingly fragile...for a man.

70
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,103
This time...

71
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,066
The only thing I was able to do
as platoon leader...

72
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,568
was to believe in everyone.

73
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,781
I was naïve... I didn't have enough power...

74
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,492
It's all my fault!

75
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,953
Are you afraid of getting hurt?

76
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,842
Shikamaru...

77
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,264
Are you going to be argued down
by a girl and run away?

78
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,767
It's a drag...

79
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,771
I don't want to have arguments.
I'm not a woman.

80
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,441
Yeah... But you're not a man, either.

81
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,152
You're just a coward!

82
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,364
Even if you quit being Shinobi,
the missions will continue.

83
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,450
Someone has to do it.

84
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,746
Your comrades will just
be dispatched again...

85
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,414
under a different platoon leader.

86
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,127
And your comrades might die there.

87
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,089
But if at that time,
you were the platoon leader...

88
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,592
your comrades might be saved
from that happening to them.

89
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,222
If you reflect on this time,
make use of the experience and learn,

90
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,016
you might be able to carry out missions
with more perfection.

91
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,273
If you really think your comrades
are important to you,

92
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,233
before you think about running away...

93
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,196
think about becoming more exceptional
for the sake of your comrades!

94
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,368
That's what real comrades are, you coward!

95
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,335
Intensive Care Unit 6

96
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,433
He's okay, now!

97
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,479
The antidote has stopped
the death of cells

98
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,650
caused by the side effects of the Pills.

99
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,861
You were a big help this time, Shikaku!

100
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,866
The Nara Clan's secret medicinal
preparation manual was very useful.

101
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,120
It must've been tough to
make something like that...

102
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,831
It's the result of day-to-day study.

103
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,750
Thanks...

104
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,251
Lady Tsunade!

105
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,801
Neji Hyuga...
His safety line has been secured.

106
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,515
And, there's some information...

107
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,770
Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki
have just now returned.

108
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,942
Although seriously injured,
it seems it's not life-threatening.

109
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,078
Two, huh?

110
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,582
Shikamaru...
It seems the mission is a failure.

111
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,466
But, everyone is alive!
That's the most important thing.

112
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,390
Next time for sure...

113
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,351
I'll carry out the mission perfectly!

114
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,911
Sasuke...You're the chosen one.

115
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,124
Whatever... Just give me "power."

116
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:52,342
Even though the form is different,
it's still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.

117
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,762
If you don't want to die,
use more care in how you talk.

118
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,601
Wh-What? This quality of Chakra...

119
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,523
Yes... My future is inside this kid...

120
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,193
Hidden Leaf Hospital

121
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,538
I'm going to where Orochimaru is!

122
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,169
Please...bring back Sasuke!

123
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:34,301
I'll bring Sasuke back without fail!
I promise that on my life!

124
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,437
Oh...You were awake, huh?

125
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,397
Shikamaru!

126
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,322
I'm going on ahead to Choji!
What about you?

127
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,493
I'm going on ahead to... Naruto and Sasuke!

128
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,998
I see... So everyone's okay. That's good.

129
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,589
Then, Sasuke...

130
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,802
Yeah...he's gone.

131
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,654
Intensive Care Unit 6

132
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,115
Then, I still can't see him...?

133
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,745
Yeah... But Lady Tsunade said that
he should regain consciousness soon.

134
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,957
Thank goodness...

135
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,584
It's really a great help that

136
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,295
Lady Tsunade returned to the Leaf Village.

137
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,715
If she hadn't, right about now,
Choji would be...

138
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,471
The Lady Fifth...Hokage.

139
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,816
You've come to visit?

140
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,944
Information sure travels fast.

141
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,994
Sakura...

142
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,455
Naruto...

143
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,379
I heard you suffered
quite a serious injury...

144
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,381
But you look well, considering.

145
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,847
I'm sorry... Sakura...

146
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,811
Why do you apologize?

147
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,236
Being you, you probably
got reckless again, right?!

148
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,198
Jeez, you look like a mummy...

149
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm sorry... I...

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,665
Hey... The weather's nice today.
So open the curtains.

151
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,047
Sakura! I...

152
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,008
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

153
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,221
I promised on my life.
That's what I said, so I...!

154
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,184
It's okay already, Naruto...

155
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,522
-Sakura! He...
-I always...

156
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,150
said that, so... I...

157
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,238
I stick straight to what I say!

158
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,615
That's my Way of Ninja!

159
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,052
Naruto...

160
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,016
Thanks, Naruto...

161
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,776
I'll get right to healing this injury
and I've got to bring Sasuke back!

162
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,156
Wh-What was that?!

163
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,538
Per...Pervy Sage?!

164
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,790
Yo!

165
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,922
I've come today to tell you
something important.

166
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,801
From here on, as my official disciple,

167
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,429
I'll train you to become
a full-fledged Shinobi in three years.

168
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,556
Three years...?

169
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,101
I've received some credible information
from a certain source

170
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,519
concerning the "Akatsuki."

171
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,146
Akatsuki...

172
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,276
It seems that it will be
three or four years

173
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,903
before they come after you next.

174
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,408
I don't care about that!

175
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,494
Talking about stuff that's
so far down the road...

176
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,289
I don't have the time
to be doing slowpoke training!

177
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,750
What do you mean?

178
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,836
If I don't go after Sasuke immediately,

179
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,714
he might be killed by Orochimaru!

180
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:28,136
"Immortal" doesn't mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is.

181
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,681
Before his body decays,

182
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,852
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.

183
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,776
It seems you've learned
of the true purpose

184
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,153
for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke...

185
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,031
Huh?! Then that means you also knew...?

186
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:53,244
I was looking into
Orochimaru's Immortality Jutsu.

187
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,497
It seems with that Jutsu,

188
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,960
he can't reincarnate into
the next body for three years.

189
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:06,424
And unable to wait for Sasuke,
he just recently reincarnated...

190
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:11,388
It'll be okay for three years from now...
There is time.

191
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,557
That's not a lie, is it?!

192
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,518
Not a lie, is it?!

193
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,729
Nope...

194
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,902
However...

195
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,199
Forget about Sasuke...

196
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,831
Sasuke went to Orochimaru
on his own accord.

197
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,667
No matter what you do, he won't change.

198
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,256
I've seen many Shinobi, so I know...

199
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,592
Sasuke is the same kind as Orochimaru.

200
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,890
If you're thinking about bringing him back,
just forget it.

201
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,018
That's something an arrogant fool
would do!

202
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:05,024
He may be nothing to you
but he's my friend!

203
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,236
Would a friend hurt his comrade?!

204
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,989
Take a look at your current plight!

205
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,408
This is...!

206
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,126
Why? Why would you...?

207
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,463
We were called Sannin together...

208
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,090
Weren't we comrades since we were kids?!

209
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,304
In every regard,
you're a foolish guy, Jiraiya...

210
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,016
You lack thought in everything you do.

211
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,479
That's why you didn't notice
what I was doing.

212
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,941
Can't you rethink it, Orochimaru?

213
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,943
Absurd!

214
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,363
How can you be so stupid?!

215
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,451
No matter how much I wanted it...

216
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,078
in the end, there was no way
he would come back.

217
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,542
After the agony, all that's left was
my own powerlessness and regret.

218
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,756
I don't want you to go through
the same thing...

219
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,223
If you're going to go after Sasuke,
then there'll be no training.

220
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,058
I'll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you

221
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,186
and depending on the case,
prohibit you from leaving the village.

222
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,149
You're not just an ordinary kid...

223
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,652
You possess the Nine Tail Fox
that the Akatsuki is after!

224
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,571
This is serious.
I'll just have to do that...

225
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,325
if you're going to act on your own
without listening to what I say.

226
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,831
Eventually, you're going to have to deal

227
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,167
with guys more troublesome
than Orochimaru.

228
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,087
Give up on Sasuke.

229
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,424
Sooner or later this was going to happen.

230
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:57,095
Don't suffer anymore!
Forget and dismiss him.

231
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,514
It's not just Jutsu or power...

232
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,893
If you're a Shinobi, develop eyes that
can make the right judgment.

233
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,855
And if you're going to live
as a Shinobi, become wise.

234
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,190
If you remain a fool...

235
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,693
the reality is that it will be tough
living in this world.

236
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,738
Fine.

237
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,827
If that's what being wise is...

238
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,662
Then I'm fine being a fool for life!

239
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,082
Even if by myself,

240
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,878
I'll create even more awesome Jutsu
and save Sasuke no matter what!

241
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,299
And, and,
I'll even kick the Akatsuki's butt!

242
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,233
If someone like you were to do it alone...

243
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,777
the best you'd be able to come up with

244
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,739
would be some stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.

245
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,371
It might somehow work out

246
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,082
if you are a big fool and
not an ordinary fool...

247
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,544
Be prepared once
you're out of the hospital,

248
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,296
you big fool.

249
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,007
See you then.

250
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,217
Roger!

251
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,646
-It's been seven years since...
-...all the members gathered like this.

252
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,440
Since Orochimaru left the organization.

253
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:36,653
That Orochimaru has gotten the Sharingan.

254
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,405
Itachi...Your little brother?

255
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,327
Don't get hasty. Yeah.

256
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,288
We'll kill Orochimaru eventually...

257
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,625
More importantly,
there are only three years left.

258
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,252
Can everyone accomplish
the work required of them?

259
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,504
Huh?

260
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,590
Yes, our goal is...

261
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:03,471
to get everything,
including the Nine Tail Fox in question!

262
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:15,608
When I recalled the parts one by one,

263
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:21,906
I felt as though
I had understood everything

264
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

265
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:32,667
which I kept so close to me

266
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,880
Speechless nights,

267
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:42,552
a hint of warmth,

268
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:49,225
and this distant yearning for you

269
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,186
I live,

270
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,984
simply repeating this cycle

271
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:06,868
Held in my two hands

272
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,246
A droplet of time

273
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:17,837
Softly clutching forgotten memories

274
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,715
Lost words

275
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,186
I'll keep these thoughts...

276
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:41,611
Sakura's been weird all along
ever since Sasuke left.

277
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,987
I can't put it well,

278
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,490
but she's gloomy or fretting or something.

279
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,078
On top of that she says,
"This time I'll do my best on my own."

280
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,039
What the heck does that mean?

281
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,291
It's bugging me, it's bugging me!

282
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,753
This isn't the time for me
to be relaxing in the hospital!

283
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,508
