1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,541
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,546
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,764
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,603
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,409
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,052
Hasn't this increased
since last month?

16
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,678
Yes, it has.

17
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,889
It's now widely known
in distant lands

18
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,974
that you were appointed to Hokage,
Lady Tsunade.

19
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:44,313
Bills have started to come in addressed
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.

20
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,650
Hokage is not something to take on.

21
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,696
My name is Tsunade...

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,282
I'm the Fifth Hokage of
the Village Hidden in Leaves.

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,203
My concern now is a debt
that absolutely will not go down...

24
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,412
And...

25
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,790
Grandma Tsunade!

26
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,501
– Hey wait!
– Naruto!

27
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:06,836
– Lemme go!
– Calm down!

28
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,673
If there aren't any missions,
let me go search for Sasuke!

29
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,843
You've been told to train,
haven't you, Naruto?!

30
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,137
Grandma Tsunade!

31
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,559
That...

32
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,480
The Treasure Hunt is On!

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,528
I won't let you through!

34
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,284
Goal!

35
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,876
Too bad.

36
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,256
But it's totally obvious since
it's the same person doing it.

37
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,718
There haven't been
any missions lately, either.

38
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,765
I wonder if the Pervy Sage will
come back soon...

39
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,184
I can't train by myself...

40
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,479
What, there was someone here
before me?

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,691
Huh? Kiba... Akamaru...

42
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,485
Here I thought I could take
my time to train.

43
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,531
Are you by yourself?
Where are Hinata and Shino?

44
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,744
Shino is backing up another team
with Kurenai Sensei...

45
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,955
Hinata said she'd train at home.

46
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,000
Is it like we've lost our jobs?

47
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,419
Don't say that...
I'll feel empty-hearted...

48
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,338
Naruto! Kiba!

49
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,050
Hinata...

50
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,552
Weren't you training at home?

51
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,639
There was a call from the Hokage.
She wants us to come immediately.

52
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,057
Then...

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,644
All right! Our first mission in a while!

54
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,813
Treasure hunting?

55
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,693
That's right. This person here,
an old acquaintance of mine,

56
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,028
is our client this time around...

57
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,532
My name is Agari Kaisen.

58
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,745
Please look at this.

59
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,081
This is a map indicating
the location of the treasure.

60
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:11,251
It seems a treasure worth several
hundred million ryo lies buried there.

61
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,963
S-Several hundred million?!

62
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,716
If I were to eat Ichiraku's
special portion ramen everyday...

63
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,599
I don't think you could eat all that
even if you spent your whole life eating...

64
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,184
Awesome!

65
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,853
But it's on the map, right?

66
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,731
Is this a job to go to the trouble
of asking Shinobi to do?

67
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:38,821
Yes. The treasure is in a location
difficult for ordinary people to get to.

68
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,700
Even I tried getting there...
but there was no way.

69
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,036
So it's the Shinobi's turn, huh?

70
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,746
The deadline is in three days.

71
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,833
If you succeed, there will be
a special reward from Agari.

72
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,751
Set out with caution!

73
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,044
– Yes!
– Yes!

74
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,006
Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!

75
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,592
Indeed, it isn't a difficult mission.

76
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,429
However... if you fail...!

77
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,223
– What?!
– What?!

78
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,104
– Yay, yay!
– Hey, wait!

79
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,526
If you fail...

80
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,321
you will go back to the Academy!

81
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,865
– What?!
– What?!

82
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,701
You'll re-enroll in the Academy

83
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,162
and re-do your Ninja training
from square one.

84
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,164
Wh-Why us...?

85
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,126
I looked up your mission success rate
over these past few months...

86
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,004
Naruto! You're decisively poor!

87
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,338
What?!

88
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,674
In particular, the success rate
when you team up

89
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:44,303
with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga
is hopelessly low!

90
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,680
Now that she mentions it,

91
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,266
it's the members we failed
an earlier mission with...

92
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,313
We also failed before when
four of us, including Shino,

93
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,149
went looking for Bikochu Beetles...

94
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,655
Something rings familiar, right?

95
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,492
But, just Naruto aside,

96
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,577
why should we also have
to go back to the Academy...?

97
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,581
Collective responsibility is fundamental
in Ninja teams.

98
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,958
Everyone takes responsibility
for a failure.

99
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,252
Got it?!

100
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,554
It...it'll be okay. No way should we fail
at hunting for treasure...

101
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,182
If you don't drag us down.

102
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,602
What?! Don't you be dragging us down!

103
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:40,067
If we fail... we'll have to study
with these kids, right...?

104
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,953
Hey, what's up?

105
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,164
Naruto, Kiba, Hinata,
all three of you together?

106
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,290
Iruka Sensei...

107
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,627
You guys must have come
to miss the Academy, huh?

108
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,754
You could come back if you like.

109
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,426
I'll never go back!

110
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,221
What's with them...?

111
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,809
I'll make this mission a success
no matter what

112
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,310
and put Grandma Tsunade
to shame!

113
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,105
And I'll have no part of
going back...

114
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,691
to the Academy on account
of associating with you.

115
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,694
The failures until now
are a collective responsibility.

116
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,863
It's not just my responsibility!

117
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,447
I don't know about that.

118
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,952
The success rate of our team
without you in it is high.

119
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,663
Then I'll prove on this mission

120
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,540
who it is who really drags us down,
believe it!

121
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,167
That's just what I want.

122
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,588
I wonder if this will be okay?

123
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,438
It's a dead-end!

124
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,024
So this is as far as
there's a path, huh...?

125
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,613
There's a river up ahead.
How should we cross it...?

126
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,409
Then, here here.
We should cut straight through, right?!

127
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:17,289
Are you an idiot?
Mountain terrain isn't that simple.

128
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,082
I would go...this way.

129
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,713
Are you an idiot?
That's totally the long way around.

130
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,383
Then you want to compete
to see which is faster?

131
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,761
No way will I lose!

132
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,139
All right! The finish line
is that boulder!

133
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,935
Start! Let's go, Akamaru!

134
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,603
This will be a cinch!

135
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,729
What? What?

136
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,440
Wait, Naruto!

137
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,368
Naruto...

138
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,452
What?

139
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,371
It seems we're climbing up
quite a bit...

140
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,539
It's okay!

141
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,014
Naruto!

142
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,315
It's...okay.

143
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,652
We should be totally faster than Kiba, so...!

144
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,950
Yes! I win!

145
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,536
Something smells good...

146
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,499
Huh?

147
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,875
So you finally made it, huh?

148
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,419
Kiba!

149
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,505
You were so late I went ahead
and got some food ready...

150
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,973
Now then... which way?

151
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,019
We should...
we should just cut right though this!

152
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,648
Naruto!

153
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,234
Good grief...

154
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,409
W-Water...

155
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,329
Here, water.

156
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,958
This way's definitely faster!

157
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,214
I sure slept well.

158
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,845
Akamaru and I often
train in mountains like this...

159
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,474
We know a lot more about
the mountains than you guys.

160
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,059
Shut up!

161
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,403
Shut up, I say!

162
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,614
Don't be acting all big just because
you won two or three times!

163
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,491
Not two or three times.
Five times!

164
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,702
S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!

165
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,387
Naruto and the others
should be there pretty soon, huh...?

166
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,391
This mission looks easy at a glance.

167
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,851
But it won't go that easily...

168
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,774
They'll probably realize that.

169
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,865
A limestone cave, huh...?
But...

170
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,034
Geez, hurry up already!

171
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,246
You said the buried treasure is
in a limestone cave, right?

172
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,330
Just a minute!

173
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,375
The limestone cave is supposed
to be further ahead.

174
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,460
We shouldn't have been able
to find it this easily...

175
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:55,590
It's not like there are
that many limestone caves!

176
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,426
So here's fine...

177
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,718
Let's go, Hinata.

178
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,845
R-Right...

179
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,346
H-Hey, wait, you two!

180
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,809
I can't see anything...

181
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,697
Oh, it's a dead-end...

182
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,865
It can't be!

183
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,326
Naruto! Hinata!

184
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,044
Look out! Run, you two!

185
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,422
Wha...?

186
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,720
This...couldn't be over...

187
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,432
That person said it'd be okay
at just this extent...

188
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,735
What happened...?

189
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,404
By any chance,
was an enemy after us?

190
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:03,408
No...Akamaru's saying
he didn't smell anyone.

191
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,659
It was probably just an accident...

192
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,538
I told you this wasn't the right place!

193
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,374
But, as a person,
if you're looking for a limestone cave

194
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,709
and there's one right in front of you,

195
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,961
one would usually think
that's the place, right?!

196
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,173
Don't be getting smart with me.
Here I saved your butt!

197
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,510
I didn't ask you to save me.

198
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,762
What?!

199
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,514
Hey... you two...

200
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,857
A shard from the ceiling
hit you, huh...?

201
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:36,942
You okay?

202
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
It seems I'm the one
dragging us down...

203
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,493
Not at all!
If I had been more cautious...

204
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,870
At the end of the day,
it's your fault, Naruto.

205
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,038
Kiba!

206
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,707
Nevertheless, I'll have no part of
going back to the Academy

207
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,918
on account of associating
with you, Naruto...

208
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,505
Akamaru and I will find the treasure.

209
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,840
What're you saying, Kiba?!

210
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,884
There's no point if
we don't all do it together!

211
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm...okay, so...

212
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,473
From here on, there will be locations
all along the way so rough

213
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,892
they are beyond comparison
to those up until this point...

214
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,813
It'll be nothing but places that
really only a Shinobi can get through!

215
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,691
It'd be absolutely impossible
for someone with an injured leg.

216
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,401
Oh...

217
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,946
Besides... we can't just leave someone
who's injured, right?

218
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,448
We need someone to stay with her.

219
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,409
Then it doesn't have to be me...

220
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,995
Can you find the treasure by yourself?

221
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,832
You can't read a map worth a damn
and you don't know the mountains...

222
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,458
To be straight...

223
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,004
we've wasted a ton of time
on your account, so!

224
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,465
Rest easy.

225
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,384
After I find the treasure,

226
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,511
you won't have to go back
to the Academy...

227
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,430
Let's go, Akamaru!

228
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,600
H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!

229
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,353
Damn it...!

230
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,982
Now.

231
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,067
Naruto!

232
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,277
Huh?

233
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,500
Are you awake, Naruto?

234
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,880
Hinata...

235
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,006
Naruto!

236
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,597
There are...two Hinatas!

237
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:31,973
Naruto...

238
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,476
Naruto...

239
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,481
Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?

240
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,567
Could it be... you were twins?!

241
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,777
– No!
– No!

242
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,153
Then...

243
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,615
One of you transformed into Hinata
with a Transformation Jutsu, huh...?

244
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,119
I can't...tell you apart at all...

245
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm the real one!

246
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,790
I'm the real one!

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,251
Your voices are also
exactly the same!

248
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,128
I know.

249
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,421
At a time like this,

250
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,216
I should ask a question
that only the real one knows.

251
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,386
I'll come right out and ask!
What's Hinata's father's name?

252
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,389
– Hiashi Hyuga.
– Hiashi Hyuga.

253
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,852
Oh, yeah. As for me,
I didn't know Hinata's father's name.

254
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,145
What?!

255
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,064
– Naruto...
– Naruto...

256
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,484
At a time like this,
if Kiba and Akamaru were here...

257
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
Here they could tell by smell
which one is the real one...

258
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,740
Nope. It'd be impossible even
for a Ninja Hound...

259
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,825
What?

260
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,620
This isn't just an ordinary
Transformation Jutsu, so...

261
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,998
Mister...As I recall,
you're the client this time around...

262
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,333
What are you doing here?

263
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,878
It wasn't buried treasure that I wanted...

264
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,588
It was your faces.

265
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,090
Faces...?

266
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,052
I already got...your face...

267
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,515
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

268
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,684
That's...me...

269
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,147
I guess I'll be setting out
to get the last face...

270
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,110
Leave it to me!

271
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,541
This is the place...

272
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,837
This inside of the cave
is as the map says...

273
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,963
There's no doubt.

274
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,685
It's under this rock, huh?
I'll go in one shot!

275
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,276
Huh?

276
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,073
This, huh...?
I found it surprisingly easy.

277
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,868
What is it, Akamaru?

278
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,996
Kiba? That's you there, isn't it, Kiba?

279
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,832
Kiba...?

280
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,793
Naruto...Hinata...

281
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,004
I told you guys to go
on back first, didn't I?!

282
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,299
Come on! Come on! Here we went
to the trouble of coming!

283
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,676
This mission is for the three of us, so...

284
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,805
Hinata... is your injury okay?

285
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,892
Yeah...I became able to move
after resting a bit, so...

286
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:25,313
Wow! You already found
the treasure?!

287
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,357
Then let's take it back
to the village quick!

288
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,192
Right...

289
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,614
Wait... How did they get here
so fast without a map?

290
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,034
And moreover,
Naruto has zero sense of direction...

291
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,787
And Hinata has an injured leg...

292
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,418
Akamaru...doesn't seem to be feeling
any particular suspicion.

293
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,963
Am I being paranoid...?

294
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,268
It seems they're back.

295
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,812
Kiba! Akamaru!

296
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,024
Heh! Didn't we tell you?

297
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,152
Even a Ninja Hound's nose
can't tell the difference...

298
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,783
Let's begin.

299
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,747
Face Copying Jutsu!

300
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,341
What's that...?

301
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,469
We also copied faces like this.

302
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,305
As you can see,

303
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,140
when performing
the Face Copying Jutsu,

304
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,767
the person being copied
must be close by.

305
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,186
And moreover,
it takes a degree of time.

306
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,358
But once a face has been copied once,
it's an impeccable Transformation Jutsu

307
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,736
that is beyond even
a family's recognition.

308
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,654
No way...

309
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,198
Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!

310
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,412
Wh-What the hell are you...?!

311
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,914
I'm Kiba Inuzuka.

312
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,879
You guys...

313
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,798
What's the big idea?!

314
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,551
Kiba!

315
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,719
Kiba!

316
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,934
Those are the real ones, huh...?

317
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,071
Who the hell are you guys?

318
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,741
The name of our clan
is the Kedouin Clan.

319
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,577
We're a clan that possesses
the secret Face Copying Jutsu.

320
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,996
Why our faces?

321
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,584
We're going to return to the Village
Hidden in Leaves in your place,

322
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,462
and mess up the village good!

323
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,863
The wind blows, Ah...

324
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,701
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

325
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,120
What should be brought along?

326
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,123
Assemble them into a piece.

327
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,210
There is no second chance, never

328
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,879
How foolish it is to throw away

329
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,008
Acting so innocently, Ah...

330
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,010
The images.

331
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,017
It probably will not end

332
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,398
It probably will not end

333
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,069
Burn that love-filled heart,

334
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,322
Sail across a thousand dreams

335
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,075
Running freely

336
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

337
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,915
The clouds scatter

338
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,002
The sun sets yet again

339
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:22,633
The solo parade begins to move.

340
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

341
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,390
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

342
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,942
Like I said, nothing good ever comes from
a mission together with you, Naruto.

343
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,194
This isn't the time to be complaining.

344
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,487
They're intending to
head for the village.

345
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,322
Then, how do we get out of here?

346
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,448
– Listen.
– With Rasengan, I'll...

347
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,657
No good. They'll notice.

348
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,409
– I can...
– Then use your Fang-Over-Fang.

349
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,203
– It'd be the same, you idiot.
– That's why I said...

350
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,621
– Then, what do we do?
– Use that, I'm telling you...

351
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,705
Naruto!

352
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:53,873
– Don't stop me, Hinata.
– Don't stop me, Hinata.

353
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,792
Not that, I mean I'll...

354
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,502
– Oh, that.
– Oh, that.

355
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:02,507
Next time: "Run, Dodge, Zigzag!
Chase or be Chased!"
