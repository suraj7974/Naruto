1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,970
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,817
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:12,615
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,537
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,143
It looks like
the preparations are complete.

16
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,981
So this is the Land of Greens
you were talking about, brother?

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,568
Well, it's a small land,

18
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,779
but it could be a good stepping-stone
for getting ahead in the world.

19
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,199
We've already bought off
half of the public officials.

20
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,702
This land will be overturned
on our signal.

21
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,249
As of today,
we're the feudal lords of this land.

22
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,209
Feudal lords, huh...?

23
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,920
That has a nice ring to it.

24
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:15,135
Open for Business!
The Leaf Moving Service

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,470
This is a problem...

26
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,640
I thought about testing out
various combinations, but it backfired.

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,519
With these remaining members,
there's nobody who can take the lead...

28
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,897
But it's merchant protection this time,

29
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,942
so no matter who goes,
there probably isn't much to worry about.

30
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,903
Mission difficulty isn't the issue.

31
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,780
It's a commission from
the Land of Greens.

32
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,157
I wanted to send them
a respectable team.

33
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,579
The lord of the castle there
was good to me in the old days!

34
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,497
True indeed...

35
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,752
He generously assumed the debts
for the bundle you blew on gambling.

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,464
It's small,
but it's a nice and easygoing land.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,304
There was an adorable princess,
and two boy Ninja looked after her...

38
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:03,684
At that time,
they both said they'd marry me...

39
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,644
I wonder if they still feel that way...

40
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,271
I don't think so.

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,274
I bet they've all gotten big...

42
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,493
We'll be at the border soon.

43
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,455
This is our last look at this scenery
for a while.

44
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:32,296
All right!
A mission, a mission!

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,008
Wait up, Naruto!

46
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,093
Everyone else was off on missions,

47
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,931
but I've been doing nothing but
odd jobs in the village!

48
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,476
I was sick of hearing stories
about everyone's adventures.

49
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,646
Still,
we're guarding merchants this time.

50
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,981
It 's probably not something
to brag about.

51
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,817
Then I should exaggerate
the story a bit

52
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,780
and say that I took out
about a thousand bandits, right?

53
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,323
That's just lying...

54
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,247
Oh! There they are.
That's them!

55
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,166
Yahoo!

56
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:14,964
Who're you?

57
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:19,009
You guys are merchants
from the Land of Greens, right?

58
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,427
That's right.

59
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,972
We've come from
the Village Hidden in Leaves

60
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,807
to protect you guys.
Believe it.

61
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,183
The Village Hidden in Leaves?

62
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,644
See...?
This, this.

63
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,147
We were told to protect you
from mountain bandits...

64
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,402
It's for certain.

65
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,197
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,032
And this is Hinata.

67
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,909
I'm Choji Akimichi.

68
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:48,455
Um, we received one more item
from the Hokage

69
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,083
to identify ourselves with.

70
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,506
Hey, Momiji.
Give it back.

71
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,591
Oh, it's true.

72
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,886
These people are from
the VIllage of the Hidden Leaf.

73
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,763
See...?

74
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,974
The Leaf Moving Service

75
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,268
Wh-What's that?

76
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,104
Old lady Tsunade...
she's done it this time!

77
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,317
I see. I'm Kikusuke.

78
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,571
This is Yurinoshin. He's Shun.

79
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,825
I'm Momiji!
We'll be counting on you movers!

80
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,840
You sure eat a lot.

81
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,550
That's why you're so f...

82
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,510
Fa?!
...full figured.

83
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,763
For you.

84
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,432
I love people with great strength.

85
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,726
Something like this is a cinch.

86
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,061
See? Watch.

87
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,812
Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll...

88
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,522
Somebody help me!

89
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,819
That Choji, getting all carried away.

90
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,405
Move faster, mover.

91
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,365
We're rapidly falling behind.

92
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,744
We're not movers, I'm telling you.

93
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,455
Why don't you help out
before complaining?!

94
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,123
No, it's fine.

95
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,377
Our cousin Shun is in poor health.

96
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,883
You don't need to worry,
Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.

97
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,010
I had no intention of
listening to anything

98
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,720
this good-for-nothing has had to say
from the start.

99
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,849
Who's a good-for-nothing?!
Just you watch!

100
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,358
Honestly,
it's because you push yourself too far...

101
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,444
I'm sorry...
Shun's being unreasonable.

102
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,905
Water!
Oh.

103
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,911
Mine's empty, too.

104
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,163
Then there's some fresh drawn water.

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,581
Here!

106
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,544
Wow,
how'd you find water in a place like this?

107
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,338
My grandma taught me.

108
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,798
Your grandma?

109
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,258
It's this...

110
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,301
You can tell with this.

111
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,720
What?!
With those?

112
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,639
It's called dousing.

113
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,683
If you concentrate
on the item you're looking for...

114
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,187
these rods will react to that item
and will inform you when you're near it.

115
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,315
It's knowledge passed on
from our predecessors.

116
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,068
When I get back to the village,

117
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,029
maybe I'll try to find money
that people dropped with that.

118
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,783
Tasty!

119
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,797
It doesn't compare to the water
in the Land of Greens, but it's good water.

120
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,009
Come to think of it,
what kind of place is the Land of Greens?

121
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,471
The Land of Greens is...
a small land deep in the mountains.

122
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,143
Everyone in the land loves nature
and is warm-hearted.

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,854
It was indeed Shangri-La...

124
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,064
Was...?
Oh, it's nothing...

125
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:05,569
But, you know, if it's such a great place,
why do you need protection?

126
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,992
It's targeted because
the people take peace for granted!

127
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,956
What do you mean by that?

128
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,502
Stuff like loving nature
and being warm-hearted sounds nice.

129
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,131
But the bottom line is that the people
in the Land of Greens are all softhearted.

130
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,258
We live in a troubled time now.

131
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,677
Something like believing in people
is ridiculous.

132
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,474
Hey, the Land of Greens
is not something to speak ill of like that.

133
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:42,064
The lord of the castle there was kind
even to us merchants passing through.

134
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,154
To think he'd take up that kind of attitude
with an old lady...

135
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,823
He's kind of disagreeable.

136
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,035
He's your cousin, right?
Do something about him.

137
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,578
R-Right.

138
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:00,874
He's probably a bit touchy
from the bad things that have happened.

139
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,585
I'm sorry...
Oh, i-it's okay...

140
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,300
Hey, that's dangerous.

141
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,680
It's dangerous
to wander around alone.

142
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,266
Brother Choji, look at that...

143
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,689
Naruto!
What is it?

144
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,774
That.
Wh-What is that?

145
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,777
That's in the direction of
the Land of Greens, right?!

146
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,781
I'm going to go check it out...
You take the others and go on ahead.

147
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,533
I'll be right back.

148
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,832
Listen.
What we saw here is a secret.

149
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,167
We don't want everyone to get worried.

150
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,794
Yeah.
Got it.

151
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,758
Huh? Where's Naruto?

152
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,428
Th-The bathroom...

153
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,372
I'll give this to you
if you tell me what you saw earlier.

154
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,378
Black smoke...
was rising.

155
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,089
Black smoke...?!
From where?

156
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,051
The direction of the Land of Greens.

157
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,846
Lord Shun...
It's finally...

158
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,064
I should be at the Land of Greens
border pretty soon.

159
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,450
Wh-What was that ...?
There was no presence at all.

160
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,835
Who're you guys!

161
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,469
Who're you guys?

162
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,431
That headband. You're with
the Hidden Leaf Village, right?

163
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,977
So what if I am?
Why are you targeting me?

164
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,439
I have no intention
of fighting you guys.

165
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:35,028
It seems the ones we are looking for
are heading this direction, you see.

166
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,198
Those who prowl around here will die.

167
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,832
Did we do it...?

168
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,377
The Substitution Jutsu?!

169
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,712
The real one is over here!

170
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,820
These guys are pretty good.

171
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,701
Two left.
One of them is the real one!

172
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,043
What?!

173
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,135
Too bad!
Those two are also clones.

174
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,430
I'm going to turn back for now...

175
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,189
Choji! Hinata!

176
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,150
How'd it go, Naruto?

177
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,985
Actually, there's trouble...

178
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,405
Guys! Let's take a break here
for the time being!

179
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,373
Pursuers from the Land of Greens?

180
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,708
They said that...

181
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,710
The ones they were looking for
were headed in this direction.

182
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,172
But why would Ninja
be after this group?

183
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,884
These people are just merchants,
aren't they?

184
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,137
And they're not even people
from the Land of Greens to begin with...

185
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,390
Now that you mention it,
that's right.

186
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,475
But what will we do?

187
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,479
We're going to engage them if they come,
of course.

188
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,022
That might be impossible...

189
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,983
We have elderly people
and children with us.

190
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,360
You're right...

191
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,569
I know.

192
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,448
It could be that
they're not chasing after us!

193
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,659
What do you mean by that?

194
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:51,122
Basically, we're moving
in the same direction as their true target

195
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,833
and we could just be
in their battle ground...or something.

196
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,919
I see.

197
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:02,592
That means if we clear the path,
they'll let us go right by. Alright.

198
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,553
Listen up, guys!

199
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,431
Some kind of troublesome guys
are heading this way.

200
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,641
Troublesome guys?

201
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,812
Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious
if you say it like that.

202
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,105
I-I see...

203
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,233
But you don't need to worry.

204
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,571
They're probably not after us...

205
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,448
It'll kind of be the long way around,

206
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,785
but we'll make it through
if we take a little side turn up ahead.

207
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,504
Does this feudal lord really have this little?

208
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,048
He's a feudal lord
who's a prestigious ruler of virtue.

209
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,259
So he would never line his pockets.

210
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,219
But we'll squeeze out a big pile
from now on.

211
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,889
More importantly, has
the young girl in question been found?

212
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,391
Nope...

213
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,352
But the two who were tracking her
got attacked.

214
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,022
We know the direction she fled in.

215
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,399
That young girl just would not be good.

216
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:04,988
If they get away, they may return
with forces from other lands.

217
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,907
If the sun were a little stronger,

218
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:12,037
I could burned down a whole mountain
with my Jutsu...

219
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,875
Then I'll go...

220
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:29,429
Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators
in the hall as you ordered...

221
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,681
Oh, good work.

222
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:37,646
Without your guys' help, we couldn't have
brought down the castle this easily ...

223
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,943
Then brother,
shall we go for the hall greeting?

224
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,488
Okay... I'll take care of things here.

225
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,205
So, about the thing you promised...

226
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,707
Oh, that's right.

227
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,585
Take as much there as you like.

228
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,088
Really?

229
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,638
Honestly. It's so easy to deceive
softhearted people...

230
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,182
It really is exactly so.

231
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,811
Our lord believed in us
until the very end...

232
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
Come on.

233
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:23,775
If you stuff that much in there,
the ferry on death's river will sink.

234
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,365
I make it a habit not to believe in people.

235
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,910
Especially people
who have betrayed someone once...

236
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,496
Y-You're joking, Lord Renga...

237
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,748
It's no joke.

238
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,798
C-Could it be that you had me
gather the collaborators in the coup to...

239
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,516
You're also softhearted!

240
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,777
That should do it.

241
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,835
Yurinojou, it seems they're after us.

242
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,171
Yes.
I leave Lady Haruna to you.

243
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,756
What are you going to do?

244
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,010
If we wait here for their attack,
there will be too many to defend.

245
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,555
Since it's come to this,
I'll slow them down.

246
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,766
But according to the information,

247
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,560
they are three Janin
who use unknown Jutsu.

248
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,103
I know.

249
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,523
But my Jutsu will not be defeated
by the likes of them.

250
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,693
Very well.
Go, Kikunojou.

251
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,112
Yes, Lady Haruna.

252
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,122
Naruto.
I set a trap for the time being.

253
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,541
Jeez, Hinata.
You're such a worrywart.

254
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,918
You don't need to go that far.

255
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,338
Huh? Yurinoshin,
where's Kikusuke?

256
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,340
You're right.
Since when...?

257
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:14,052
Oh, he had some other business
and went on ahead...

258
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:18,973
Say what? Taking liberties like that
is really a problem...

259
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,977
Oh, I see.
So that's it, huh?

260
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,480
What is it?

261
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,900
Even Kikusuke makes sure
to go to the bathroom.

262
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,235
Naruto...!

263
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,241
Lady Haruna, I shall protect you
with my life!

264
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,411
There!

265
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,794
Who're you...?!

266
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,922
I'm Ruiga.

267
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,800
To think you'd
just come right on out nonchalantly.

268
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,761
Then she must in that group, right?

269
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,723
If it's one against one,
I won't lose to a hired Ninja like you!

270
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,184
Can you do it?

271
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,437
Have a taste of
the Land of Greens' Flower Ninja Art!

272
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,369
Eat this! Flower Shuriken!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!

273
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,587
Too easy...

274
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,714
I don't know about that!

275
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,680
Flower Ninja Art: Release!
Myriad of Flowers!

276
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,518
Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon!

277
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:51,316
Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh?
Futile, futile!

278
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,777
And Genjutsu next, huh?

279
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,710
This is the finishing blow.

280
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,296
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!

281
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,991
Too bad.

282
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,912
The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja
can't beat me.

283
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,583
Now it's my turn!

284
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,795
Eat this.

285
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,047
Water Style: Liquid Memory!

286
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:16,150
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

287
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:23,116
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

288
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,506
Yellow Moon.

289
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:45,388
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

290
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:50,643
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

291
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:57,525
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

292
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:04,532
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

293
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:11,247
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

294
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,837
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

295
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:24,761
A magical chord change, in a restless city

296
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:31,768
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

297
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,651
A running-ramen strategy, huh?

298
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,905
In other words, we split up
in order to avoid annihilation, right?

299
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,783
With this,
the protection burden will decrease.

300
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,951
But won't the soup spill if it runs?

301
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,244
This is an example.

302
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,121
It'd still be trouble
even if it's just an example, believe it.

303
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,874
Then, let's make it
the running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy.

304
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,168
If you say so, Naruto.

305
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,254
I mean, do you really understand
the strategy, Naruto?

306
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,382
Next time:
"Mystery of the Targeted Merchants."
