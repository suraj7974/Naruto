1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,887
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,811
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,818
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,491
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,746
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:43,836
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:50,718
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,652
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,740
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,285
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,872
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,459
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,713
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,931
What's the matter?

21
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,392
After pursuing me like that,
what's up with you?

22
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,479
You're not even able to touch me...

23
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,523
What a laugh!

24
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,609
Sakura...

25
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,574
I don't know how far I can go, but...

26
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,079
I have to give it...my best shot!

27
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,168
Naruto's Ninja Handbook

28
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,879
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

29
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:15,845
Here goes!

30
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,556
From this moment on,
Secret Ultimate Taijutsu technique!

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,726
Naruto Uzumaki...
Clone Body Slam!

32
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,400
– Now!
– Now!

33
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,651
Okay!

34
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,946
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

35
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,158
Once again...
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,786
Take this!

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,830
Leaf Village Secret Ultimate
Taijutsu technique

38
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,498
learned from Kakashi Sensei!

39
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,877
A Thousand Years of Death!

40
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,257
An enema?

41
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,100
Boom.

42
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,650
Sasuke...?

43
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,113
That was a splendid blow.

44
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,075
D-Did that get him?

45
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,579
Gaara...

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,881
Doing all that work...
And managing just one blow, huh?

47
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,425
S-Shut up!

48
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,806
He attacked the base of the tail
which has the weakest defense...

49
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,227
Even though I'm not wounded,
I can't absorb the impact.

50
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,648
Did I underestimate him too much?

51
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,945
Hey, Naruto...

52
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:01,033
Sakura... Go rescue her
if it's the last thing you do!

53
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,827
And after you've rescued her...

54
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,039
take Sakura and
lose no time in fleeing.

55
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,583
You, if anyone, can do it!

56
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,880
Sasuke... You...

57
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,927
I still have the ability...
to hold him in check for a while.

58
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,389
If things end here...

59
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,892
it would just mean that
was the extent of the man I am.

60
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,189
I lost everything once...

61
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,901
I don't want to see...

62
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,989
any precious comrades die
right before my eyes again.

63
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,034
Precious...comrades...

64
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,870
I will not allow my comrades...

65
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,499
to be killed, no matter what.

66
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,548
I see...

67
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,928
That's right.

68
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,808
Because he resembles me...

69
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,727
Because he has gone through life

70
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,271
with the same loneliness
and sadness as I have...

71
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,609
That guy who continued to fight
in solitude for himself,

72
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,903
I thought...he was strong.

73
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,198
Naruto...

74
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:27,870
But that's not the meaning
of true strength...

75
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,123
If one fights just for
oneself in solitude...

76
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,876
one can't really become strong...

77
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,883
Is there someone who
is precious to you?

78
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,723
When a person wants to protect
someone who is precious to him...

79
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:55,397
it's then that they truly...
become...strong.

80
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,822
You will...become strong.

81
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,292
He's releasing such
massive amount of Chakra!

82
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,879
That's...Naruto?!

83
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,759
No matter what, I will...

84
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,931
protect you!

85
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,275
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

86
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,287
He's pretty good, this one.

87
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,167
I've kept you waiting
a long time!

88
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,755
The spiraling series of Naruto Uzumaki's
Ninja Handbook starts now!

89
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,968
W-What's up with this...
large number of clones?!

90
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,928
What the heck is this?

91
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,557
T-This is...amazing!

92
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,853
You are pretty promising.

93
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,313
You... This is...

94
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,900
Sasuke, you get yourself
a good rest.

95
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,321
Leave the rest to Naruto Uzumaki!

96
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,616
This guy is...

97
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,246
All right! Everyone! Here I go!

98
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,083
that Naruto?!

99
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,756
Jump!

100
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,677
Naruto's...Ninja...Handbook!

101
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,557
Everywhere...

102
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,184
Shuriken!

103
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,020
My body hasn't fully recovered...

104
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,272
My only choice is to
use Sand as a defense!

105
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:10,949
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki...!
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki...!

106
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,467
– Barrage!
– Barrage!

107
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,604
T-This guy...!

108
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,356
– This time, I'll use both legs...
– This time, I'll use both legs...

109
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,566
– and go for a 4K Barrage!
– and go for a 4K Barrage!

110
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,571
Who the heck is that...?
Suddenly...

111
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,033
Unbelievable...
To get Gaara in that state...

112
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,995
Where does that strength come from?

113
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,750
No way!
There's no way...

114
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:09,091
No way I'll...lose to...a guy like this...!

115
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,397
W-What's...that?

116
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,906
It finally...emerged.

117
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,591
The Perfect Possession!

118
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,891
This is...
the monster inside that guy.

119
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:05,939
I didn't think you would
expose this form!

120
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,571
Naruto!

121
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,950
Darn...my body...!

122
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,539
My Chakra has...
with all those clones earlier on...

123
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,338
Sakura!

124
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,590
D-Darn...!

125
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:42,225
I, Inu, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji...

126
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,394
This will mark your end...

127
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,814
– Sand Burial!
– Summoning Jutsu!

128
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,283
It's amazing that he can utilize
a Summoning Jutsu in that state...

129
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,870
I will protect...

130
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,873
Sakura!

131
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,888
Naruto Uzumaki...

132
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,312
You continue to give me
such pleasure...

133
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,900
Naruto...
What in the...world...?

134
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,987
My hours of practice
are finally paying off!

135
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,532
I can do it!

136
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,784
– What is this?
– Huh?

137
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,371
Not you again!
What in the world do you want?

138
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Huh?!

139
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:55,215
That must be...
the Shukaku of the Sand.

140
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,177
Chief Toad!
Come join me in this fight!

141
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,641
No way!

142
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,976
What?!

143
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,730
Why would I go out of my way
and fight a guy like that?

144
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,399
That's idiotic!

145
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,900
Why?!

146
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,778
You told me the other day that you
would make me your henchman!

147
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,615
It's only natural for a chief
to help out his henchman!

148
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,325
That's respect and duty, right?!

149
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,830
It's true I told you
I'd make you my henchman...

150
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,085
But we haven't even exchanged
cups of sake to seal our relationship yet...

151
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,797
Gimme a break! I'm still underage!

152
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,674
I can't drink alcohol!

153
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,803
Don't say that and just listen
to what this guy says, Pop!

154
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,555
Huh?! Pop?!

155
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,018
Why are you here, Gamakichi?

156
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,937
I had lots of time on my hands,
so I came to visit...

157
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,523
Huh? Huh?
You're father and son?

158
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,776
Then that guy over there
tried to bully me!

159
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,905
What was that?!

160
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,284
When that happened,
this guy here rescued me...

161
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,578
He clashed with that monster...

162
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,414
Pretty interesting guy.

163
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,876
I see...

164
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,222
Kid... I recognize you
as my henchman...

165
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:30,644
and I'll show you what duty
and respect means!

166
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:52,541
I'll make you pay the price
good and proper, you underling!

167
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,381
Hang on tight!

168
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,932
How's that?!

169
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,939
Awesome...

170
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,630
What a guy...

171
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,798
He's so heavy,

172
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,259
I could barely manage to
thrust my dagger through him.

173
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,678
If I don't hurry up,

174
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,763
this battle will change
the shape of the landscape.

175
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,516
Hey! Hey! Chief!

176
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,811
Sakura is over that way,
so don't move that way!

177
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,522
Please lure him in this direction.

178
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,441
Sakura...?

179
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,193
That's his girlfriend, Pop.

180
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,696
I've got to take that guy down.

181
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,407
Otherwise, I won't be able
to rescue Sakura!

182
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,620
Interesting!

183
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,583
This is interesting!
Naruto Uzumaki!

184
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,460
T-This isn't good!

185
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,463
That Gaara...
He's intending to do that thing.

186
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,881
I better get out of here!

187
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,814
Huh...? That is...

188
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,277
That's...the medium...?

189
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,573
To thank you for entertaining me
up to now...

190
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,286
I'll show you the real power...

191
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,913
of the Sand Spirit!

192
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,333
The circles under his eyes...

193
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,462
Those are symptoms of
insomnia which indicate

194
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,216
that the medium is also possessed
by the Shukaku of the Sand.

195
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,468
Insomnia...?

196
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,807
Those who are possessed
by the Demon Raccoon Shukaku

197
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,353
are unable to sleep soundly
through the entire night.

198
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,605
Because of the terror...

199
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:28,071
If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowly
eat away at their personality

200
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,866
and eventually that person
is no longer himself.

201
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,415
Because he normally
doesn't get much sleep...

202
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,878
the medium's personality
tends to...become unstable.

203
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,423
Oh...

204
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,387
Therefore, usually while
the medium is awake,

205
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,558
the power of Shukaku is
normally controlled.

206
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,893
However...

207
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,524
when that medium sleeps...

208
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,484
Playing Possum Jutsu!

209
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,206
He's done it...!

210
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,377
W-What's gonna happen, Chief?

211
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,048
If one sets Playing Possum Jutsu
into motion...

212
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,593
...the Shukaku will appear!

213
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,228
I'm finally able to emerge!

214
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,274
That's the Shukaku?

215
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,735
He's pretty funky...

216
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,825
Right away!
The guy I wanna kill! You!

217
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,870
-I'm gonna jump...
-Huh?

218
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,123
Wind Style: Air Bullets!

219
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,086
Water Style: Water Bullets!

220
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,390
That's practically a storm...

221
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,435
What kind of a battle is this...?!

222
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,066
Chief! I told you,
not in that direction!

223
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,069
Shut up! I know!

224
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,239
Air Bullets!

225
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,991
Water Bullets!

226
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,412
Too bad...

227
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,665
This isn't good, Chief!
There's one shot left...!

228
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,509
Yeah! I killed it...

229
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,344
I killed it!

230
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,976
That hurts...!

231
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,644
How dare you shoot me

232
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,688
with bullets containing
stupid amounts of Chakra!

233
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,651
Even I can't take that many shots!

234
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,403
What should we do?!

235
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,199
For a start,
wake up that medium kid!

236
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,159
It will release that Jutsu!

237
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,953
How do we go about waking him?!

238
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,998
Give him a good punch!

239
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,167
Water Bullets!

240
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,587
Like I'll take that!

241
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,633
Now!

242
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:46,477
Chief, I can't hit him
unless you hold him down!

243
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:53,943
This Toad doesn't have fangs or claws
to hold that guy's movement.

244
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,321
What should we do then?!

245
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,408
We'll use the Transform Jutsu to
change into something that has those!

246
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,494
But with that said...

247
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,289
I'm not particularly good
at transformations.

248
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,373
Huh?

249
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:12,295
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!

250
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,379
Whaaaat?!

251
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,757
Time for a combined transformation!

252
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,258
Uh...Okay!

253
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,803
We got to have fangs and claws!

254
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,680
Umm...

255
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,599
Let's go!

256
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,936
Wait...
Say, w-wait a second...!

257
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,356
F- Fangs and claws... Fangs and claws...
Fangs and claws!

258
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,526
Transform!

259
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,992
Transform Jutsu!

260
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,125
That's the...!

261
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,189
A cycle of hardship, right?

262
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:18,152
Inside, we were crying, right?

263
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,742
But the one thing we won't give up

264
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,328
is the dream we've chosen, right?

265
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
It's a secondary role,

266
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,587
a role in the shadows

267
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:41,551
But in reaching for that dream,

268
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

269
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,270
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

270
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:56,941
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

271
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:03,990
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

272
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:09,829
Over and over,
we've seen fools

273
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,042
Over and over,

274
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:18,004
we've stood in the shadows of others

275
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:24,719
Now, it's our turn...

276
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:29,724
Let us bask in our dreams

277
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:41,944
I don't know about your past,
and my past doesn't matter either!

278
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,281
I only have people who I must protect.

279
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,949
Hey you with no eyebrows!

280
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,411
Let's just end this as similar fighters.

281
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,497
I will finish this with my next hit.

282
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,585
This will be, absolutely and totally,
the last one!

283
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,881
Next time:
"Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light"

284
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,966
<=sign>
