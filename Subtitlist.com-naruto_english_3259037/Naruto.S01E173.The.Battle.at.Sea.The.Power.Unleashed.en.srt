1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,541
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,546
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,634
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,805
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,519
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,117
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,289
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:37,473
Battle at Sea:
The Power Unleashed!!

16
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,191
So you're a monster too!

17
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,318
You're one to be acting
you are above me!

18
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,864
Take this!

19
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,787
What?!

20
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,959
Crap!

21
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,204
This is bad!

22
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,289
Naruto!

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,292
I'm counting on you...

24
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,141
Naruto! Hang in there.

25
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:03,893
Naruto!

26
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,442
I-I'm okay...

27
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,486
Isaribi... Thank you.

28
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:26,957
Oh no!

29
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,043
I'll take the rest of your Chakra!

30
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,127
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

31
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,755
Impossible!

32
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,052
Made it in time...

33
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,891
What?!

34
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,436
I see... It was you, huh?!

35
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,026
The nerve of you to mess with me!

36
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,402
Stop it, get away!

37
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,789
Don't turn your back to the enemy...!

38
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,626
You forgot the ironclad rule
of the fight...

39
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,795
You lose!

40
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,845
You saved me...

41
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,811
That brat hit me with all his strength...

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,982
And that Yoroi is no good either.

43
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,617
I caught a huge fish!

44
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,870
You mean you're going
to escape alone?

45
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,636
We completed accommodating
all the injured soldiers.

46
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,514
Good work!

47
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,599
What's left is...

48
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,185
Naruto and others, right?

49
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,779
Of your numerous crimes...

50
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,073
When we return to the village
justice will be served,

51
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,241
and it won't be quick,
so prepare yourself.

52
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,453
It's not over yet...

53
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,290
You! I haven't hit you enough yet!

54
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,669
That's too bad.

55
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,087
What?!

56
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,268
What...What's going on?

57
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,982
The Sea Monster doesn't die.
It is immortal, that one!

58
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,533
For the Sea Monster,
this limitless seawater is its life...

59
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,036
In the end, it will be your loss!

60
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,413
Shut up!

61
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,292
Summoning Jutsu!

62
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,815
All right! I'm counting on you, Chief.

63
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,109
Go clobber that flabby guy!

64
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,199
Hey, Chief! We don't have time
for you to be so leisurely!

65
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,034
That monster...
Whack him in one go...

66
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,539
That's hot! Hot, hot!

67
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,133
You got no business getting
so motivated all by yourself!

68
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,805
It itches, itches and
I'm getting a rash all over my body!

69
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,558
Wait, wait.
Don't come over here, Naruto!

70
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,603
Damn him...

71
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,730
I'm going to rip you apart
when the mission is over!

72
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,107
Remember that!

73
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,153
Naruto! How are you going
to settle this?!

74
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,656
How can you say that,
Chief Toad is the strongest frog!

75
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,617
Please don't let something like
the saltwater bother you and fight.

76
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,956
Humph! You can't even control
the summoned animal you called up!

77
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,666
What was that?!

78
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,126
If you don't send him home quickly

79
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:44,089
the Sea Monster will gulp him down
and he'll whither like a slug!

80
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,925
A slug, he says?!

81
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,095
Hey, Naruto! I'm going to
kick your butt later...

82
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,805
Right now, I'll help you.

83
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,056
Huh? F-For real?!

84
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,934
Don't mess with amphibians...

85
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,979
I'll show you my terror!

86
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,690
Yeah! Now you're talking.

87
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,067
Hang on!

88
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,948
Wh-What the...?

89
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,493
You rat... Let go of me, huh!

90
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,622
What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!

91
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,498
You be quiet!

92
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,422
Upsy!

93
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,098
This isn't accomplishing anything...

94
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,060
What's up with
that flabby bastard, really?

95
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,439
In short, this is some kind of monster

96
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,569
consisting of water gathered around
its spiritual body at the core.

97
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,737
Crap!

98
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,656
I don't really know what that means,

99
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,949
but I guess I can't do anything
about that thing.

100
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,243
Even though we pierce the monster
with a dagger all we want,

101
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,037
the monster will suck up ocean water
and come back to life...

102
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,456
Then what should we do,
Chief Toad?!

103
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,667
The only thing we can do here is

104
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,753
to somehow damage
the spiritual body at the "core."

105
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,464
Damage...? How?

106
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,925
The opponent is a clump of water...

107
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,428
Add heat and he'll evaporate!

108
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,140
The thoughts of fools mean nothing...

109
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,853
The only thing you can do is to
surrender to me, I who control the ocean!

110
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,489
Damn. You're annoying.
Let's go, Naruto!

111
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,700
What? Go? Where are you going?!

112
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,495
Airhead! I'll spew oil!

113
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
Huh?

114
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,213
Light a fire with
a Fire Style Jutsu!

115
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,717
What?! I can't do
a Fire Style Jutsu!

116
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,552
Here we go!

117
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,763
What? Fire, fire, fire!

118
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,269
How's that?!

119
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,320
What?!

120
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,240
H-He did it...!

121
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,992
Well done!

122
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,369
Naruto...

123
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,747
Im... Impossible!

124
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,874
We did it, Chief Toad!

125
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,168
How's that!

126
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,172
Chief Toad and me is
the strongest combination, after all!

127
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,675
Naruto! You're in a festive mood
all by yourself,

128
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,136
though I'm wondering if
you've forgotten about something?

129
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,138
Huh? Forgotten what?

130
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,933
You called me to a place like this...

131
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,603
Look, now I've got all of
these goose bumps!

132
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,939
You've always had all those warts...

133
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,903
Shut up! I'll have you
settle this properly!

134
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,947
What?! Wha...?
W-Wait Chief Toad! Wait!

135
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,492
No use talking!

136
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,626
It itches. I can't take it!

137
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,837
Something like this doesn't
soothe my feelings but,

138
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,883
my sons have caused you inconvenience,
so I forgive you this time.

139
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,470
See you!

140
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:26,770
I'm sorry, Chief Toad... Help me...

141
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,742
Now that we also got rid of
the Sea Monster, Amachi...

142
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,912
You'll be taken to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

143
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,914
as the principle offender of
the attacks on ships collecting funds.

144
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,377
Shame! We had got kicked
around because of you!

145
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,382
What are you doing?!
Isaribi, kill these guys!

146
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,595
I won't!

147
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,013
Have you forgotten?

148
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,016
I am the only person who
can turn you back into a human!

149
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,685
If I continue doing this,

150
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,187
I'll be a monster all the way
to my heart!

151
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,232
That's right, Isaribi!

152
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,241
You're neither a human being
nor fully integrated like me.

153
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,995
The best you can do is to live
the rest of your life as a monster

154
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,455
for your whole life!

155
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,541
Well, from the very start,

156
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,919
I hadn't thought of a way
to turn you back into a human!

157
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,089
Like I told you...

158
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,302
I was intending to dissect you!

159
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,845
No way...

160
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,263
You!

161
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,849
How rotten are you?!

162
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,561
Stop it.

163
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,149
Once we've returned to
the village, he'll be punished harshly.

164
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,535
Well... It's about time you told us.

165
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,499
Where...did Orochimaru go?

166
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,962
You think I know something
like that?!

167
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,759
You were tossed aside
by Orochimaru.

168
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,511
It serves you right to follow
after him forever.

169
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,056
You and I are different!

170
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,141
I'll be in charge of the research center

171
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,061
and some day, will become an entity
that'd bring Orochimaru to shame.

172
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,731
Really...

173
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,155
Just for yourself. Not fair!

174
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,992
And now, mission completed.
Let's return to the island!

175
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,328
Not fair. I'm also slug
a good one before that.

176
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,496
Stop it!

177
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,266
That's the Jiro Island
Amachi was talking about...

178
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,437
Here is the source of my nightmare...

179
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,400
This place is where the fragments
of my missing memories is left.

180
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,771
Master Orochimaru...
What in the world did you...?

181
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,058
She's alive...!

182
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,020
She's a lucky girl...

183
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,234
After we tested ten,
only one survived...

184
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,156
I guess this experiment yielded
little something before I take my leave.

185
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,741
Leave...?

186
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,787
Because it looks like
there's no reason to be here anymore...

187
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,997
But, the research is still...

188
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,628
That facility, do with it
whatever you want.

189
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,549
I have no need for it anymore...

190
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,180
– Why...? How could you do this?
– Why...? How could you do this?

191
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,018
– I always respected you, yet you...
– I always respected you, yet you...

192
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,028
You're lacking many things.

193
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,031
Motivation to desire the "power"...

194
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,700
Tenacity...

195
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,994
Hatred...

196
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,955
Everything!

197
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,922
But, let's see...

198
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,092
I suppose just the fact
that you survived

199
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,012
might mean you have some value...

200
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,059
Say? Do you want to come with me...?

201
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,714
I see...

202
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,178
I'll find a better-gifted child then...

203
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,614
It connected...

204
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,167
So bright...

205
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,880
I wasn't cast aside...

206
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,008
I, on my own...

207
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,011
by my own will... chose it!

208
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,939
Hey, hey, where did Sensei go?

209
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,233
When I woke up this morning
she wasn't here...

210
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,944
Will be right back!
Anko
Leaving behind only
a note like this!

211
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,322
Seriously...
She sure is a fidgety person!

212
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,658
What did you say?
Who do you think you are?

213
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,159
Whaddya mean?!

214
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,578
What, you object?!

215
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,121
Um...

216
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,960
Really... Can I come with you?

217
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,254
Don't worry!

218
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,422
There's a very scary,

219
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,925
but awesome Medical Ninja
in Village Hidden in the Leaves!

220
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,555
Yes, because Lady Tsunade
is a medical specialist.

221
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,141
That's right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!

222
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,351
Surely she'll do something for you!

223
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,937
Relax and let us take care of it.

224
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,523
Thank you.

225
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,152
Hey, all of you!

226
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,072
What are you doing?!
The boat will leave!

227
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,991
When did you...!

228
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,826
What were you doing?!

229
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,786
We've been waiting for you
this whole time, Sensei.

230
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,997
Sorry, sorry...

231
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,419
Wait! We're getting on!

232
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,557
Okay! We're going home
to the Leaf Village!

233
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,562
No doubt, you are hyper
from the start to the finish...

234
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,564
Do you know what being tired is?

235
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
Any problem?

236
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,945
I'm praising you! I appreciate it!

237
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:41,407
Huh? Really?
You're embarrassing me.

238
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,780
The wind blows, Ah...

239
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,617
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

240
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,078
What should be brought along?

241
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,081
Assemble them into a piece.

242
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,127
There is no second chance, never

243
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,796
How foolish it is to throw away

244
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,091
Acting so innocently, Ah...

245
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,759
The images.

246
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,058
It probably will not end

247
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:55,314
It probably will not end

248
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,028
Burn that love-filled heart,

249
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,239
Sail across a thousand dreams

250
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,159
Running freely

251
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,954
To take hold of the world in hand

252
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,999
The clouds scatter

253
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,085
The sun sets yet again

254
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:22,592
The solo parade begins to move.

255
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,012
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

256
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,348
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

257
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,777
Guarding a high-profile individual.

258
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,987
Sure has a nice ring to it, believe it!

259
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,991
Yeah! A mission has finally come
that suits my ability!

260
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,701
Just you wait,
you great heir to a fortune!

261
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,996
Now that I've taken this on,
I'll go through fire or water or...!

262
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,331
Hey, what's this?!

263
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:57,460
Isn't this just a D-rank mission
with babysitting?

264
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:02,673
Next time: "Impossible!
Celebrity Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!"
