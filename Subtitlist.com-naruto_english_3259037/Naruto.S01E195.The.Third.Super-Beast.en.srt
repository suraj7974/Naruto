1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,920
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,195
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,498
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,734
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,496
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,519
Say, Grandma Tsunada,
am I really so...?

17
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,233
Come to think of it, recently I feel dull

18
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,027
and I make more mistakes
with Jutsu than before.

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,529
And, what's more, even worse...

20
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,450
I can't eat more than five of
the large-size ramen noodles at Ichiraku...

21
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,578
Might I perhaps have
some terrible illness?!

22
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,249
Come on, and tell me.
I'm prepared to hear the worst!

23
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,542
You are in good health.

24
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,626
Huh?

25
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,047
Hey! That's Bushy Brow's
medical record, isn't it?

26
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,675
Recently he's been avoiding
his regular check-ups.

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,843
Bring him in, will you?

28
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,511
Huh? But, what about me...?

29
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,472
You are stupid. That's all!

30
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,723
Be on your way!

31
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,602
Put your clothes back on, you idiot! Yes!

32
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,770
Unbelievable!

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,690
How was it?

34
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,483
I'm fit as a fiddle!

35
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,902
I could tell that just by looking at you.

36
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,654
What's that all about?

37
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,573
He doesn't seem to be in
a very good mood, does he?

38
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,618
Oh, by the way,
have you seen Bushy Brow?

39
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,745
No, but I know where he is.

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,207
These days,
you can always find him here.

41
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,417
Oh...

42
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:52,423
2954... 2955...

43
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:58,429
2956... 2957... 2958...

44
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,473
That's just amazing...

45
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,810
Even after having surgery
for the kind of injury

46
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,395
that could prevent him from
continuing on as a Ninja...

47
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,359
– Bushy Brow!
– Lee!

48
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,485
Bushy Brow!

49
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,447
Lee...

50
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,533
It's nothing.

51
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:23,662
Grandma Tsunada told me to bring you
for your regular check-up.

52
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:29,627
It slipped my mind.
I've been feeling fine lately, so I just...

53
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,046
You don't look like it though.

54
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,382
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL

55
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,888
Rest for a while.

56
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,556
You are forbidden from engaging in
any missions or training for the duration.

57
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,727
There is cumulative damage
to your Chakra Network.

58
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,854
You were once injured so badly

59
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,315
that you had to give up on being
a Ninja for a while.

60
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,026
It's my self-rule.

61
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,239
Your self-rule?

62
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,951
Yes! To never forget
my original intentions!

63
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,330
As long as I keep on trying,
I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!

64
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,088
All right.

65
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,173
I will remove you from active duty
for a while,

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,549
but you may continue training.

67
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,551
Just don't overdo it.
Yes!

68
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,222
In particular,
I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!

69
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,849
Got that?
Y-Yes...

70
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,733
Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?

71
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,406
What's wrong? Hey!

72
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,243
The results were bad.

73
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,203
Judging from the way he looked,
I'd say considerably...

74
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,414
By "considerably,"
do you mean that "considerably"?

75
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,874
Yes.
Considerable, to be sure.

76
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,836
Considerable?!

77
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,010
What are you so down about?! Lee!

78
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,929
Guy Sensei!

79
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:07,641
I heard the results of the exam.
You have permission to train, don't you?

80
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,729
Yes, but the Hidden Lotus...

81
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,692
That day, you were crying right there...

82
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,198
Your surgery will be a success

83
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,035
because you have worked hard
all the way through.

84
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,497
You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens.

85
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,082
And in the one in a thousand-

86
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,961
no, one in a million chance
that something goes wrong...

87
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,631
I'm going to die with you!

88
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,930
Ever since the time I met you,

89
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:51,310
my Way of Ninja has been
bringing you up to be a fine Ninja.

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,104
I promise you!

91
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,693
You believed me then and had the surgery.
And it was successful.

92
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,653
You must have faith in me
one more time!

93
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,365
If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,

94
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,951
then strive to attain an even
greater technique through your efforts!

95
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,121
There are no limits in
the face of your efforts.

96
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,539
Sensei!

97
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,587
You are a genius at effort!

98
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,176
Yes, sir!

99
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll give you some training for
the first time in quite a spell!

100
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,722
First, dash to the Academy practice hall!

101
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,973
Please instruct me!

102
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,685
If you don't get there in ten seconds,
it's 500 push-ups!

103
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,895
Right!

104
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,775
The Third Super-Beast!

105
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,363
It was rash of us to think we could
make it in ten seconds, after all.

106
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,532
Just as well!

107
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,951
Five hundred...

108
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,834
It's been a long time since
I smelled this smell...

109
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,526
Who is he?

110
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,237
That's Yagura.
He's been here for a week.

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,825
An acquaintance asked me to determine
whether he has aptitude as a Ninja.

112
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,785
His name is Yagura, you say?

113
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,247
He's pretty good, isn't he?

114
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,958
Yes, he has the instincts for it.

115
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,546
He absorbs the things I teach him
like sand absorbs water.

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,424
Oh! You're Rock Lee, aren't you?

117
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,758
Y-Yes...

118
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,469
I hear that you have superb techniques.

119
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,930
Sensei has told me about you.

120
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,349
No, nothing that great...

121
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,727
Don't be bashful, you.

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,478
– Master Guy?
– Yes?

123
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,024
I would like to receive some instruction
from my senior.

124
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,109
Fine, then. Begin!
Huh?!

125
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,445
Guy Sensei!

126
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,614
You came to train, anyway.

127
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,492
First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner
and warm up.

128
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,577
I see...

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,497
He's a spring chick who has just arrived,
so try not to let him get hurt.

130
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,749
Right.

131
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,336
What's Bushy Brow doing in
the Academy practice hall of all places?

132
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,463
I thought his condition was
considerably bad!

133
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,715
Yes, considerably! Considerably!

134
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,176
– Huh?!
– Huh?

135
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,057
I'm inexperienced,
but please instruct me.

136
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,852
Oh, please bear with me, too.

137
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,567
Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both
to give it all you've got

138
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,986
but to also observe
the greatest courtesy.

139
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,284
That is friendship!
That is youth. Get ready. Fight!

140
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,453
H-He's fast!

141
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,829
Let's have you show me...

142
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,791
The depth of the Taijutsu that
Might Guy drilled into you!

143
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,338
What power!

144
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,221
Every single blow is heavy!

145
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,139
I haven't the strength to absorb them!

146
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,477
Leaf Hurricane!

147
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,108
Closing off the escape path above
and strike from a low position...

148
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,192
However...

149
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,073
The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!

150
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,954
Stop! Hold it right there!

151
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,580
Lee! Are you all right?

152
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,502
Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!

153
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,045
What was that that just happened?

154
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,756
The Cross Method...

155
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,762
Meeting the opponent's kick

156
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,015
and pinning his foot between
the knee and elbow simultaneously-

157
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,517
a "bone-crushing daring technique ."

158
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,478
Where on earth
did you learn that, Yagura!

159
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,272
I didn't intend to do that.

160
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,566
My body just moved
like that involuntarily...

161
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,819
Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?

162
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,908
If Lee hadn't been wearing his weights,
his ankle would have been crushed.

163
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,289
It was a splendid move.
Well then, let's continue with the practice.

164
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,124
Let's stop here for today.

165
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,251
I'll take you to the hospital to
have them look at it.

166
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,836
No, I'm completely fine, I tell you...

167
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,589
We knew from the health check-up

168
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,966
that Bushy Brow's injuries were
considerable to begin with, didn't we?

169
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,092
Considerable!

170
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,094
What was considerable?

171
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,598
I'm telling you,
just considerable, right?!

172
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,809
– Probably considerable...
– Considerable, I tell you!

173
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,811
Even with the weights on, that speed ...

174
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,772
What was considerable?!

175
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,696
Fortunately, there's nothing wrong
with the bone.

176
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,156
I see.

177
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,040
Um... When can I begin training again?

178
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,542
Huh? What are you saying?!

179
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,086
You're going to need complete rest
for a while.

180
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,256
It's amazing that your Achilles tendon
remained uninjured, you know...

181
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,099
You said considerable, so...

182
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,270
I misunderstood it to mean that
he was in a considerable condition.

183
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,605
But...

184
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,733
he came out from the examining room
looking very down,

185
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,735
so I just assumed...

186
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,739
To be sure, he seems dispirited.

187
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,784
He was beaten by a trainee
who isn't even enrolled in the Academy.

188
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,161
A trainee? Lee?

189
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,581
Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu
for only one week.

190
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,042
In any case,
he was incredibly skilled, that ...

191
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,711
What's it called...?

192
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,796
The Cross Method!

193
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,005
Yes, that!

194
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,050
He's a genius to deploy
that at the instant!

195
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,761
I hope Lee isn't feeling down, though.

196
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,930
If he were the kind of guy to get
downhearted about a thing like that,

197
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,182
Lee would have quit being
a Shinobi a long time ago.

198
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,350
– Huh?
– Huh?

199
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,643
When Lee was in the Academy,

200
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,353
he was told that he had neither
the talent for Ninjutsu,

201
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,022
nor any talent for Genjutsu.

202
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,235
Had it been me,
I would have given up long ago.

203
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,614
But Lee got to where he is now purely
through effort and persistence.

204
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,032
If he can just heal his injuries,

205
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,453
he'll soon outstrip anyone with
natural talent alone.

206
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,538
– That's true.
– Darn right!

207
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,998
But...

208
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,584
I've heard that if you train too hard,

209
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,086
you can wreck your body and
become a decrepit...

210
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,213
Don't say such a thing!
You're talking about Bushy Brow!

211
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,091
I'm only kidding.
Just a slip of the tongue.

212
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,635
– Don't even say that in jest!
– Decrepit?

213
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,180
I know, I know.

214
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,850
But actually, we are grateful to Lee.

215
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,268
Huh? Grateful?

216
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,729
Yes, grateful.

217
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:56,067
Okay, today I'm going to teach you
about self-rule.

218
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,277
Self...

219
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,528
...rule, you say?

220
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,322
Yes! Yes! Yes!

221
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,033
Please teach me! Me! Me!

222
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,326
All right, ready?

223
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,620
To all things there are principles,

224
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:12,501
and to efficiently make use of things
in daily life, human beings have rules.

225
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,879
Okay, today I have something good
to give you all.

226
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,882
– Something...
– ...good?

227
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,300
This!

228
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,719
O-Oh!

229
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,971
These tights of the type that
I habitually use...!

230
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,890
They have outstanding ventilation
and moisture-wicking properties!

231
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,226
Developed for ultimate ease of movement,
it's a complete of of super-athletic wear!

232
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,145
If you wear them when you're training,
you'll feel the difference immediately!

233
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,230
You won't be able to do without them!

234
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,815
Next thing you know,
you'll be wearing them all the time!

235
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,110
Yes, yes, yes!
Please, by all means, give me a pair!

236
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,405
Oh, I got a pair of those myself.
They look cool, don't they?

237
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,616
Oh... Is that so?

238
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,578
If it weren't for Lee...

239
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,957
This is youth!

240
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,416
This is guts!

241
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,627
This is Harutaro Minami,
spring chicken of the South!

242
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,379
– You got that all wrong!
– You got that all wrong!

243
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,925
I'm really glad that we've had Lee around.

244
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,134
Yeah, me too...

245
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,430
I'm sure a C-rank mission would
feel insufficient for you,

246
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,933
but there's nobody left to ask but you.

247
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,060
Leave it to me.

248
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,314
Oh, by the way,
there's someone I'd like to take with me...

249
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,777
Yagura!

250
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,322
When my foot heals,
let's train together aga...?

251
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,994
I feel no need to take lessons from you.

252
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,706
Even ruling out the fact that
you were wearing weight,

253
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,959
there seems to be nothing worth
stealing from you...

254
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,502
Stealing?

255
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,422
After all, skills acquired
purely through effort

256
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,883
make you nothing
but a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.

257
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,968
What did you say?!

258
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,180
As proof of that,
even Sensei has given up on you.

259
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,974
That can't be!

260
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,102
Guy Sensei promised me...

261
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,772
that his own Way of Ninja was to
turn me into a splendid Ninja, too!

262
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,569
Well then, I wonder why he's gone
so far as to ask me

263
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,363
to come on a mission with him
for practical training...

264
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,449
Not you, but me!

265
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,326
You?

266
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,247
Too bad. There's no way effort
can win out over talent.

267
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,583
Wait!

268
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,168
Did Sensei really asked you to...?

269
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,552
No, it...can't be true...

270
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,774
Lady Tsunade!

271
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,192
Wh-What is it?

272
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,361
Yagura has been injured and
is under protection.

273
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,697
What? Guy was with him.
What on earth happened?

274
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,910
No! Yagura is said to have been attacked
before reaching Hidden Leaf Village.

275
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,372
Then the trainee Yagura
that accompanied Guy is...

276
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,040
A total imposter.

277
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,462
Damn it, one nuisance after another...!

278
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,174
So, these three are the ones
that can be mobilized?

279
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,384
What shall we do?

280
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,263
Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto...

281
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,724
these three go after Guy
and the phony Yagura!

282
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,268
Right!
Wait!

283
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,230
Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.

284
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,065
If he learns about this,

285
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,983
he's apt to dash out,
even in the shape he's in.

286
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,068
Right!

287
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,864
Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei
went this way?

288
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:30,949
Without a doubt!

289
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,367
His destination was
the Land of Mountain Streams.

290
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,202
He must have gone through this forest.

291
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,414
There's another way to go,
cutting through the mountains,

292
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,082
but it's too dangerous.

293
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,255
Yagura, are you with me?

294
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,798
Yes, I'm here, Guy Sensei!

295
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,133
Don't slow down!

296
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,219
Take each step after first taking
the measure of the mountain terrain!

297
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,303
Right!

298
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,432
Lee could run through here blindfolded.

299
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,934
What's wrong? Yagura?

300
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,936
Oh no!

301
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,526
Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!

302
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,944
Yagura!

303
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,822
He may be a genius,
but he's still a trainee...

304
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,949
I wonder if I expected
too much from him...

305
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,618
Yagura!

306
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,787
What? Were you in such a place?

307
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,590
Wooden Training Dummies
for kung fu training...

308
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,389
Oh my... It takes me back to my youth.

309
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,727
I trained with a burning spirit on
the same kinds of Wooden Dummies.

310
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,812
It makes my body to just start
moving uncontrollably.

311
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,611
But why are there Wooden Dummies
in such a place?

312
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,321
Who in the world...?

313
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,366
And for what purpose?

314
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,130
They move well for dummies.

315
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,885
But, after all, they just look
like automated dolls.

316
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
They only have one pattern of movement,

317
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,389
and no matter
how many of them there are,

318
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:22,018
their reach only extends for
a diameter of 3.5 meters,

319
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,311
so they cannot attack.

320
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,691
What? Mister, you can move?!

321
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,656
What the heck?!

322
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,491
What is this?!

323
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,330
Hey? Can't you see anything yet? Neji!

324
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,458
Even using the Byakugan,
I can't find a single footprint.

325
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,253
They can't have gotten that far away,
can they?

326
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,506
They wouldn't have used excessively
dangerous mountain paths either...

327
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,097
However they seem to be able to move,

328
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,016
they're just stick figures crawling
over the surface of the ground...

329
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,229
Mister, you can jump, too?!

330
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,194
Not just yet!

331
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,844
Wh-What a...!

332
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,349
pleasant, high-energy training place...!

333
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:52,442
6,985... 6,986...

334
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,529
6,987... 6,988

335
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,659
6,989... 6,990... 6,991...

336
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,621
– There is no limit to training.
– 6,992...

337
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,997
– Even if I cannot use my legs,
– 6,993...

338
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
– my upper half is still in good shape.
– 6,994...

339
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,125
– Guy Sensei thinks...
– 6,995...

340
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,794
– my training is inadequate.
– 6,996...

341
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,923
– That's why he compared me with Yagura.
– 6,997... 6,996...

342
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,508
– to show me that I wasn't doing enough.
– 6,998... 6,999...

343
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,011
7,000!

344
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,433
– I have faith in Guy Sensei!
– 7,001... 7,002...

345
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,938
They're moderately powerful, but...

346
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,898
their movements are monotonous.

347
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,984
Or...so I thought...!

348
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:42,659
Shall I say I am outnumbered?
There seems to be no limit to them!

349
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,996
Wh-What is this sound?

350
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,464
What?!

351
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,359
I thought I knew,
but you do have incredible power, after all.

352
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,403
To think you have such
an amazing kick.

353
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,530
Looks like I have to put out
everything in myself.

354
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,867
Then I would put everything
I've got into this too.

355
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,661
Fine! Why don't you come at me
with intent to beat me?!

356
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,246
Please forgive me Guy Sensei.

357
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,832
But to me, this is the moment...

358
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,461
– to follow through with my own Ninja Way!
– to follow through with my own Ninja Way!

359
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,215
