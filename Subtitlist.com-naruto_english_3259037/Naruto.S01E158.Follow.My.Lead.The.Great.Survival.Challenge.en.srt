1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:35,763
Follow My Lead!
The Great Survival Challenge!

16
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,353
I-I'll do my best!

17
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,064
Looks like it'll be interesting,
huh, Konohamaru?!

18
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,234
Here...Here...

19
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,238
Heck no, heck no!
No way in heck, believe it!

20
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,746
Why should I have to do
some babysitting mission like that?

21
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,707
I don't care what you say,
Old Lady Tsunade. I refuse!

22
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,878
The team organization has already
been announced to the students!

23
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,589
I don't care about that!

24
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,258
As for me, I want to train more,
get stronger and...

25
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,595
"I'll become Hokage someday,
believe it," huh?

26
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,432
A person like that...

27
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,687
would never betray the expectations
of his adorable juniors, would he?

28
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,899
Become a unit leader and
issue appropriate instructions...

29
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,862
Protect the lives of your men
and promptly carry out your mission...

30
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,323
I thought this mission I'm giving you guys...

31
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,244
is ideal practice for becoming Hokage.

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,247
Ideal practice for becoming...Hokage?

33
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,418
If you're going so far as to say that,
then it can't be helped...

34
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,502
It's too bad...

35
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,212
Whoa! Kidding, kidding,
kidding, just kidding!

36
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,385
Say so sooner if that's the case.

37
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,762
Practice for becoming Hokage...

38
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,807
Yeah-yeah...
That has a nice ring to it.

39
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,143
He fell for it.

40
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,228
Jeez, he's naïve...

41
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,688
Naruto...

42
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,233
Now then,
my adorable team members...are...

43
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,990
These guys...?

44
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,586
Oh! Why the heck are you
on that side?!

45
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,215
Man, I don't want to do such
a troublesome mission either.

46
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,969
Shikamaru will be
an assistant to us instructors.

47
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,890
I will now begin the explanation
of the outdoor training

48
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,558
to be conducted over
one night and two days.

49
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,811
This is the spot you all
will be setting out for...

50
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,774
Great Stone Face of Warudakumi
on the summit of Mount Takurami.

51
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,110
The team leader will not take routes
other than the ones indicated on the map...

52
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,322
in order to ensure the safety
of the Academy students.

53
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,909
Along the way, there will be obstacles such
as instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,

54
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,786
as well as trap and the like.

55
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,329
But you Academy students
should be able to safely evade them

56
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,291
if you act according to the instructions
of your team leaders.

57
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,671
You'll see
the Stone Face of Warudakumi

58
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,422
after you cover about
eighty kilometers.

59
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,801
The team that brings the secret document
hidden there back to the village...

60
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,471
will have completed the training
upon crossing the finish line.

61
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,474
There is only one secret document.

62
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,518
This will be a competition
with the other teams.

63
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,814
All right.
We'll finish first, no matter what!

64
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,107
You guys ready?!

65
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,733
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

66
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:46,161
An important thing about survival is
acquiring food with your own resources...

67
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,750
This is called Beef Sashimi Grass
and it grows in this area...

68
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,002
You can eat it raw and

69
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,754
it becomes precious food
when the chips are down...

70
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,632
– Wow!
– Wow!

71
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,635
All right! All members acquire food!

72
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,554
– Yay!
– Yay!

73
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,015
This is it!

74
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,933
Let's eat...

75
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,023
That's a Blowfish Sashimi Grass.
It's a very similar poisonous grass.

76
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,903
See? The shape of the leaf
is a bit different, right...?

77
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,241
You two be careful as well, okay?

78
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,492
– Okay!
– Okay!

79
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:34,877
Listen up, an important thing in survival
is to acquire food by your own resources.

80
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,006
Something's not right!

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,632
Disappointing, isn't it...?

82
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,385
I've got an uneasy feeling...

83
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,475
Let's see...

84
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,686
The geography in this area
throws magnets out of kilter...

85
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,314
When you can't use a compass...

86
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,482
Huh?

87
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,484
You're wearing a watch, right?

88
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,402
Oh...yes!

89
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,612
Look for the bisecting angle,

90
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:07,451
which divides the 12:00 direction and the
current direction of the hour hand in two...

91
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,330
And then, when you line up that direction
with the sun as of now...

92
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,501
the approximate 12:00 direction is south.

93
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,002
Remember that!

94
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,962
– Okay!
– Okay!

95
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,301
Let's...see...

96
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,641
Huh? This way...?

97
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,102
Hey, Konohamaru... This way?

98
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,104
No doubt about it...

99
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,397
He's totally lost...

100
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,816
Right, right!

101
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,152
Yikes...This is bad, believe it.

102
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,488
A-All right! This way!

103
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,490
Come with me, believe it!

104
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,659
Will it be okay?

105
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,254
That was a more challenging route
than I thought, wasn't it, guys?

106
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,133
Challenging, my foot!
We're back at where we came from!

107
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,177
Man, we can't trust you,
Brother Naruto!

108
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,973
Then why don't you try?!

109
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,891
Give me that!

110
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,562
Oh... It's this way.

111
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,357
N-Not bad...

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,402
What's the matter, Konohamaru?!

113
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,865
What're you doing, Konohamaru?!
Give me that!

114
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,242
Sorry... Here.

115
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,953
Let me see...

116
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,165
Oh, it's that way!

117
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,667
What were you guys doing?!

118
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,504
Hey, we've come back again!

119
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,259
What...? How in the world can
we get out of here?!

120
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,513
All right... I'll do my best!

121
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,566
I don't feel good...

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,359
Hey!

123
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,778
Good grief...

124
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,375
Are you guys okay?

125
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,336
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!

126
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,963
What did you say...just now?!

127
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,798
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!

128
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,386
Lee Sensei...!
Ahh, that has such a lovely ring to it.

129
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,514
This is youth, this is extreme youth!

130
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,392
Now, run towards that setting sun!

131
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,102
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!

132
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,397
Your sweat sparkling in
the setting sun is wonderful!

133
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,982
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!

134
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,491
Finally made it, huh...?

135
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,495
Now, I guess I'll check out
Naruto's team in action.

136
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,043
Now then... Show me what
you've learned until now!

137
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,294
Go!

138
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,214
All right! Formation One, Konohamaru!

139
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,340
Sexy Jutsu!

140
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:12,261
Adults are a cinch with this Jutsu.

141
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,222
You idiot!

142
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,227
You wish, Brother Naruto!

143
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,562
Times are evolving!

144
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,606
New formation!

145
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,609
– Cheesecake Jutsu!
– Cheesecake Jutsu!

146
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,487
Fashion Model!

147
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,907
Movie Star!

148
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,743
Tanning Salon Receptionist!

149
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,413
– We're Cheesecakes!
– We're Cheesecakes!

150
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,837
I'd like to say, just what
I'd expect of my best pupils,

151
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,464
but you still don't have
enough "bust-waist-hip."

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,722
Jeez...This guy's such a pain...
as always.

153
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,068
Iruka Sensei!

154
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,528
What is it?

155
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,031
A report from the observatory...

156
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,580
Wow... It's warm...

157
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,625
Good thing we listened to you
and prepared it ahead of time.

158
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,836
We would've been soaked if

159
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,296
we were even a little slow
putting up the tent!

160
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,090
Reading ahead is important for
a Ninja...

161
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,718
In particular, if you don't acutely
sense the weatherr,

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,887
it could end up being fatal,
so be careful.

163
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,347
– Okay!
– Okay!

164
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,021
What're you doing, Moegi?
Pull it properly, believe it!

165
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,025
I've had it!
I don't want to do this!

166
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,028
Moegi! Stop saying selfish things
and hold it!

167
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,905
But...

168
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,453
What, really?!

169
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,831
It seems it's going to directly hit
the Leaf Village before dawn...

170
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,917
Jeez, why now...?!

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,377
The communication from
the observatory

172
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,587
was probably delayed due to the storm.

173
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,838
We have no choice, then...

174
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,007
The training is suspended.

175
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,259
Convey the order to all
the teams immediately!

176
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,511
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

177
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,641
Why'd you put the tent away?!

178
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,687
Brother Naruto, what's the deal?

179
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,856
This path isn't on the map.

180
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,610
We fell behind the others more
than I thought.

181
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,946
We can't be resting

182
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,322
Then, this path...

183
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,326
Yeah... It's not on the map.
It's a shortcut route!

184
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,786
– What?!
– What?!

185
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,288
Will this be okay?!

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,134
What're you doing?!
We'll be late if we don't hurry!

187
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,345
Don't talk nonsense!

188
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,806
We haven't learned that method
of climbing!

189
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,144
Right! Chakra control comes after
we've become senior students!

190
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,481
That makes no difference.
You can do anything if you get serious!

191
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,108
Come on! Let's go!

192
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,317
Damn it...!

193
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,199
Grab on!

194
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,581
Wh-What're you doing?!

195
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,167
Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!

196
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,377
If I let go, he'll blow away!

197
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,920
Let go of the bag, Udon!

198
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,423
I-I can't...!

199
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,300
It can't be helped...

200
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,511
No! I can't hold on any longer!

201
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,852
That was a close one!

202
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,022
I issued an evacuation advisory

203
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,440
to all the teams encamped
at the foot of the mountain.

204
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,110
I see... Now all that's left is
Naruto's team...

205
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,612
Iruka Sensei!

206
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,573
I found this on an unplanned route...

207
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,201
An unplanned route, you say?!

208
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,918
What do we do now?
We've lost our tent and our food...

209
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,712
There's no point in saying that!

210
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,716
What?! It's because you put your foot
on my backpack in the first place...

211
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,967
What're you talking about?!

212
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,385
If my foot hadn't gotten caught,
we would've blown away.

213
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,597
Now, now...
Stop fighting, believe it.

214
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,226
Why didn't you close the zipper, Udon?!

215
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,227
Sorry...

216
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,396
Now, now...
Don't say that, Konohamaru!

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,023
When you get right down to it,

218
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,193
it's your fault for entering a strange route,
Brother Naruto!

219
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,195
-Right, right!
-What?

220
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,571
We got behind because

221
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,033
you got caught in a trap
and were lost forever!

222
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,201
Hey, what did you say?!

223
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,994
You can't justify yourself, can you?!

224
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,331
We could've gotten through faster
if you guys hadn't gotten in the way!

225
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,124
It's because our leader's
not dependable!

226
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,126
What?!

227
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,836
Heh! How silly!

228
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,171
– What did you say?!
– What did you say?!

229
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,422
What?!

230
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,595
Ohh... I'm hungry...
Temporary ceasefire.

231
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,395
This is the spot.

232
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,897
That Naruto...

233
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,984
After all I told him about
following instructions!

234
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,361
Taking the direction of the wind
under consideration,

235
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,612
they're above here, I guess...

236
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,864
Okay, let's go, Shikamaru.
Right.

237
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,868
What's this?!

238
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,663
It's all stuff we need hot water for...

239
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,833
About the only thing we can eat
is the baumkuchen cake...

240
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,376
I'm hungry...

241
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,420
You're asking too much!

242
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,963
This is survival,

243
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,216
so it's common sense to have things ready
that can be eaten right away!

244
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,426
Right, right!

245
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,720
I won't share if you're going to complain!

246
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,893
I'm taking the big one.

247
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,855
The biggest one...is mine!

248
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,442
The big one... The big one...

249
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,072
Okay, eat up!

250
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,658
What...? But...

251
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,744
It's divided in three?

252
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,204
You're not having any here,
Brother Naruto?

253
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,623
Back in the day,

254
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:18,710
I also went without food once
when I screwed up during training.

255
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,132
We couldn't all pull together
and Kakashi Sensei got mad at us...

256
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:24,633
Cripes! Who cares about
three working as one?!

257
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,473
It's called teamwork.

258
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,142
I figured it out at that time.

259
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,022
The important thing for
a Ninja isn't rules or codes,

260
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,274
but teamwork acting for
the sake of comrades...

261
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,276
Here.

262
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,782
Sakura...

263
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,663
Brother Naruto...

264
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,417
Well as for me,
I don't like sweets, so!

265
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,753
– Oh...
– Oh...

266
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,589
You're one to talk
having bought it yourself!

267
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,633
Your stomach growled.

268
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,927
You have some too, Brother Naruto!

269
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,686
It's pretty slippery.
You okay, Shikamaru?

270
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,145
Yeah...

271
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,315
Damn it... How could that Naruto
take such a dangerous route?!

272
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,027
Jeez... He's always causing
some kind of trouble.

273
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,696
What a pain he is...

274
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,289
It seems they were here
until just a little while ago...

275
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,003
He really does cause...trouble.

276
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,464
The finish line is right
before our eyes!

277
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,175
That method of climbing isn't fair,
I tell you!

278
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,345
Right! I knew we shouldn't have
shared the food!

279
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,474
What is it, Udon?

280
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,309
What're you doing?
We'll leave you behind!

281
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,272
Something's...coming...

282
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,362
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

283
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,494
R-Run while you can!

284
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,913
G-Got it!

285
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,418
H-Hurry it up...

286
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,046
Brother Naruto!

287
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,091
– Brother Naruto!
– Brother Naruto!

288
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,766
Brother! Brother Naruto!
Hang in there!

289
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,226
What should we do, Konohamaru?!

290
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,103
We'll go help him...

291
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:46,441
But...it looks like
it'll crumble again!

292
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,528
Brother Naruto!
Let's go, Udon, Moegi!

293
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,828
Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!

294
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,128
That was close. So I made it into
a space between the rocks, huh...?

295
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,756
We're coming to help!

296
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,341
Idiot! Run, quick!

297
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,426
Konohamaru...

298
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,678
We can't do it...
Let's call for help...

299
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,680
Brother said it before!

300
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,892
The important thing for
a Ninja is teamwork!

301
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,812
Konohamaru, you...

302
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,148
No! If I move even a little,
the support rock will give way

303
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,859
and you guys will end up
getting entangled in this!

304
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,613
Brother Naruto! Have you forgotten
what you yourself said?

305
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,365
You can do anything...

306
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,325
...if you get serious!

307
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,619
You guys...

308
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,831
Konohamaru Gang!
Help Brother Naruto!

309
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,332
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

310
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,345
Be careful!

311
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,055
Easy does it!

312
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,139
Yeah.

313
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,058
But hurry.

314
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,651
It moved...Time it right and
toss it away in one shot.

315
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,194
Got it!

316
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,613
One, two...!

317
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,948
Yes!

318
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,324
It's a big success!

319
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,702
We did it, we did it!

320
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,122
That was a close one...

321
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,999
– Naruto!
– Naruto!

322
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,792
You guys okay?

323
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,753
Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!

324
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,005
Naruto! Above you!

325
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,552
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

326
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,264
Run towards Shikamaru!

327
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,314
– Brother Naruto!
– Brother Naruto!

328
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,983
Naruto!

329
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,570
Rasengan!

330
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,702
Naruto...

331
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,121
Man, making us get all nervous...

332
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,874
Excellent, Brother Naruto...

333
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,460
Thank goodness!

334
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,711
Yeah!

335
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,551
So, what's the meaning of this?

336
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,595
So you see...

337
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,722
It was all Brother Naruto's orders!

338
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,183
We were opposed,

339
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,269
but he forced us to move ahead
saying the only way to finish first

340
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,480
was to take a dangerous shortcut!

341
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,067
I said many times we shouldn't
because it's dangerous!

342
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,318
But...

343
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,947
– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!

344
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,115
What...? What?

345
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,954
It seems that's about the size of it...
You're prepared, right, Naruto?

346
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,205
Say...

347
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,668
Since when did your teamwork
get so good?

348
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,794
Naruto!

349
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,254
I've had it with lectures!

350
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,256
Hey, wait! Naruto!

351
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
Wait!

352
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:22,782
So many things happen

353
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:28,454
on this endless road, huh?

354
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:34,168
Although you're strong-willed,

355
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:40,216
your voice wavered on the phone today

356
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:47,015
What dreams did you

357
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:51,227
chase to get here?

358
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,482
Even I have times when

359
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:03,364
I just don't understand, baby

360
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:08,995
When you're sad,

361
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:14,792
I'll be close to you

362
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:20,465
Even on nights when we're apart,

363
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:26,471
I'll be close to you

364
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:32,018
I'll be close to you

365
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,444
Across the verdant wild
came the slender giant!

366
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,239
Equipped with two wakizashi,
a wandering bounty hunter!

367
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:49,160
The target is Gosunkugi,
the villainous thief!

368
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,371
A fierce battle of hunt and be hunted!
Then comes the voice to halt the action!

369
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,501
Hey, hey, hey!
That bastard thief is mine!

370
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,879
Enter Naruto Uzumaki!

371
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,633
Next time:
"The Bounty Hunter from the Wilderness"
