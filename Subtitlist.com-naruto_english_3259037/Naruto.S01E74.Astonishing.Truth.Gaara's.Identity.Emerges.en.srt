1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:17,059
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,022
<=title>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,903
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,795
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

23
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,853
Uh oh!

24
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,438
Pakkun?

25
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,148
Sakura?

26
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,657
Why did you stop
all of a sudden?!

27
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,912
The scents of Sasuke and the other two...
are quickly moving away!

28
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,250
It smells like Sasuke is
chasing those two people...

29
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,169
-What?!
-Sasuke is?

30
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,380
There are no other signs
of movement.

31
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,173
But...

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,678
Let's not just stand around.
Let's go after Sasuke right away!

33
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,805
But...what?

34
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,933
The people who are left are going
to fight each other.

35
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,104
We'll end up taking a little longer way...

36
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,106
but all there is for us to do
is to avoid it.

37
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,777
Why?! If we do that, it'll only delay our
catching up to Sasuke.

38
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,862
Let's just speed on through!

39
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,947
What are you saying, Naruto?!

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,533
We don't know what'll happen
in the battle zone!

41
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,869
Even if we don't desire it,

42
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,497
there's a possibility that
we'll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.

43
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,875
That doesn't have anything
to do with it!

44
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,503
Kid! Our mission is to bring
Sasuke back.

45
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,883
So the cardinal rule is to avoid battle
as much as possible until then!

46
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,467
– Let's go!
– Got it!

47
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,137
Fine!

48
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,487
Puppet Master Jutsu!

49
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,953
I'm from the Aburame Clan
of the Leaf Village...

50
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,499
When we fight,
we never underestimate our opponent,

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,042
no matter what puny insects
they may be.

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,210
I'll advance with full force!

53
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,671
Bring it!

54
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,195
Put me down, Temari.

55
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,406
Can you move, Gaara?

56
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,869
Gaara!

57
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,253
Kankuro is delaying Uchiha now.

58
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,171
We must use this opening...

59
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,677
If we don't get a move on,
the operation will...

60
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,679
Huh?!

61
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,640
Temari, go over there.

62
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,725
What?

63
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,895
Just beat it! You're in the way!

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,882
Astonishing Truth!
Gaara's Identity Emerges!

65
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,789
Poison on the blade!

66
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,011
I won't let you get away!

67
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,865
That's... Sasuke Uchiha!
Did he get past Kankuro?!

68
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,119
No... No matter how you look at it,
it's too soon.

69
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,538
Did another assailant come?

70
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,125
I don't know what you Sand Ninja
are scheming...

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,128
but I'll stop you!

72
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,673
And...

73
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,390
I'll ascertain your true identity!

74
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,354
Gaara!

75
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,901
Don't tell me...!

76
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,904
Is he going to rouse that thing
in a place like this?!

77
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,907
This is no joke...
It's out of my hands.

78
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,286
Stop, Gaara!
Have you forgotten the operation?!

79
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,540
You who are strong...
You who are called Uchiha...

80
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,792
You who have friends...

81
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,044
You who have a purpose...

82
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,424
You who are like...me!

83
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,012
By killing you...

84
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:55,225
I will exist in this world as
the one who destroyed all of that...

85
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,188
I can truly experience "life."

86
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,150
What is it?

87
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,112
It's so obvious if you release
such a blood-thirsty aura...

88
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,864
Come on out.

89
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,413
So it's you, eh...

90
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:22,920
What's your purpose?
Why do you seek power?

91
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,220
It 's none of your business.

92
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,973
Beat it!
You're a hindrance to my training.

93
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,362
You...

94
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,407
have the same eyes as I do.

95
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:58,872
Eyes that seek power,
brimming with hate and murderous intent.

96
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,249
You're like me.

97
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,836
Don't forget... You're my...

98
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,631
You're...

99
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,549
my...

100
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:28,902
You're...my...

101
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,908
my prey!

102
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,164
It's started...!

103
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,969
A Substitution?!

104
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,141
You're naive.

105
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,319
All right!

106
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,414
Insects?!

107
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,503
To think you'd make
a clone out of insects and

108
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,297
wrap around behind me...

109
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,381
Not bad!

110
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,927
Your reach encompasses from medium
to long distance and you use a puppet.

111
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,846
I didn't think you would
do well in close combat.

112
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,933
With that Puppet Master Jutsu
where you have to concentrate

113
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,019
on the control of the puppet...

114
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,647
the one casting the Jutsu is
prone to openings in defense.

115
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,944
You're very aware of the weakness
of a puppet master!

116
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,155
However, from here on,

117
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,825
I'll show you the essence of
this Ninjutsu fighting style!

118
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,705
The real terror of Crow...
my puppet of warfare!

119
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,009
This is Poison Smoke Bomb!

120
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,522
Did I inhale...a little bit?

121
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,402
I get it...
And the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh?

122
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,259
Listen, everyone...

123
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,304
Even if enemy Shinobi appear,
don't panic.

124
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,515
Go into the hidden room quickly.

125
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:12,065
Your Jonin and Chunin Senseis
will protect you all with their lives!

126
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,374
Oh!

127
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,042
Konohamaru...

128
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,711
It'll be okay!

129
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,464
Everyone's doing their best.

130
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,133
They can drive away
the enemies right away.

131
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,605
Cracks in the face rock
of the Hokage Lords...

132
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,149
How ominous...

133
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,652
Grandpa...

134
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,882
To have come this far...
To have come this far...!

135
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,346
Do I already lack the power

136
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,265
to drag out his soul?

137
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,519
With this feeble body...

138
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,980
even though I'm prepared to die,
is it not enough...?!

139
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:40,028
You probably could've killed me
if you'd been ten years younger.

140
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:58,088
Sarutobi! If you don't kill him now,
the village is doomed!

141
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,798
Do you understand?!

142
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,051
I...understand!

143
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,648
Useless...old man...

144
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,340
Now...Let me feel it!

145
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,302
That eye!

146
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,682
That eye...from before!

147
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,645
This doesn't look like it'll end
by the time you come for back-up...

148
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,438
Shino...

149
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,656
It looks like the poison has
slowly started to circulate.

150
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,866
I'll finish this!

151
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,839
Insects, again?!

152
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,051
But he shouldn't be able to
move so much in that state...

153
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,645
I'll make things easier for you...

154
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,024
Hey! What's wrong?!

155
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,196
What's happening...?

156
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,326
Don't tell me...!

157
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,038
It's futile...
He can't move anymore...

158
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,126
I had the beetles burrow
into every joint...

159
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,506
He stuffed beetles into its joints
so that the puppet can't move?

160
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,843
That was his aim from the beginning!

161
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,513
The beetles are passing through
the threads of my Chakra...

162
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,724
Why...?

163
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,228
That's it!
As I recall, their food is Chakra.

164
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,652
At this rate,
my location will be found out!

165
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,117
He cut the Chakra threads himself...?

166
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,923
You got careless!

167
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,011
Instantly reattaching the Chakra threads
that have once been cut

168
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,806
is simple for a first-rate puppet master.

169
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,891
And...

170
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,394
Crow is a puppet...

171
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:45,023
that has a weapon in each
and every component of the body!

172
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,153
It's a big mistake if you think
this has ended...

173
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,322
by your stopping my movements!

174
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,617
There's lots of poison
on the tip of the needle...

175
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,577
Die!

176
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,838
What?!

177
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,683
Just like that, the insects...!

178
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,603
The Chakra threads have been
bitten through!

179
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,244
What?! Why...?!

180
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,913
Where did these insects
spring out from?!

181
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,918
By beating away the bait insects
along the Chakra threads,

182
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,211
you dropped your guard.

183
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:53,633
You didn't notice...
the wriggling insects behind you.

184
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,638
The insects were moving
the whole time...

185
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,100
heading for your headband.

186
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,519
W-What did you say?!

187
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,771
The one blow earlier...

188
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:12,026
I pretended to miss and
stuck one of those beetles on you.

189
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,994
But how did you know where I was
with one such beetle...?

190
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:26,040
I...hate explaining the same thing twice.

191
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,047
Shino?
Why are you here?!

192
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,930
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena!

193
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,601
The females have almost no smell...

194
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:50,815
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.

195
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,735
Then, this one beetle on my forehead...

196
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,905
Right... It's a female.

197
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,084
The poison has circulated
through my whole body, huh...

198
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,339
It looks like I won't be able
to go to back you up...

199
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,635
I'm sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.

200
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,686
Is he a...monster?

201
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:38,154
Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!

202
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,953
Of my existence?!

203
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,501
Come out...
Sasuke Uchiha!

204
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,214
You're...my...

205
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,802
prey!

206
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

207
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:16,025
It's nothing to be ashamed about

208
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't let this scar be for naught

209
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:26,953
Walk with a smile

210
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:42,593
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

211
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:48,016
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

212
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:53,062
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

213
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:58,317
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

214
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:03,448
Everyone makes mistakes

215
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:08,619
It's nothing to be ashamed about

216
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't let this scar be for naught

217
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,255
Walk with a smile

218
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:24,552
Transform sadness into the wind

219
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:29,807
and continue to forge on

220
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,521
Forge on strong

221
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,244
What a speed and strength!

222
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,247
If I didn't use my Sharingan
to foresee his movement,

223
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,374
I would have been in pieces!

224
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,544
But a merely defensive battle
will do no good.

225
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,796
What do I do?

226
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,092
How should I stop him?
Do I need to use that...?

227
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,844
But Chidori may not...

228
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,349
Next time: "Sasuke's Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!"

229
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,434
