1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,091
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,475
listen up!

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,029
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,992
You're not old enough

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:39,498
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,879
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,549
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,921
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,136
It's so quiet, isn't it?

22
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,890
Peace is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

23
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,394
Being able to...
drink sake tranquilly like this...

24
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,985
Please, this isn't the time
to be drinking sake!

25
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,282
Especially at a time when
the village is enjoying peace...

26
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,743
you should hurry up and
finish up your work!

27
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,706
Why is it that work
never seems to cease?

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,710
That's because you never bring
a single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,422
There's disquiet among
the Kamizuru Clan?

30
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,466
That's a communiqué from
the ANBU Unit

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,593
stationed in the Land of the Earth,
isn't it?

32
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,012
That's a name one rarely hears.

33
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,559
The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers
of the Hidden Stone Village.

34
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,853
Long ago, they were so famous
as to be extolled

35
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,147
as equals of the Aburame Clan...

36
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:35,030
But they've died out and hardly anyone
remembers their name...

37
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,740
I see...

38
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,829
It says there's been some disquiet,
but there can't be many of them left.

39
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,290
It's really nothing to worry about...

40
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,965
What's the difference?
Don't All Insects Look Alike?

41
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,388
Wow... There are so many insects...

42
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,224
This is truly a paradise for insects...

43
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,018
We won't get stung, will we?

44
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,063
Almost none of these insects will
cause bodily harm to humans.

45
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,066
I do have some of the Aburame Clan's
secret recipe insect repellant...

46
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,445
but I would prefer not to use it,
if at all possible.

47
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,447
Because it would also repel
the Bikochu.

48
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,992
Then you shouldn't have
brought it out in the first place.

49
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,914
There's no mistake...

50
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,999
That kid in the lead...

51
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,376
he's a member of the Abarame Clan,
after all.

52
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,886
I never imagined that
we'd bump into them in a place like this.

53
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,641
Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?

54
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,769
Anyone who wants to get their hands
on a Bikochu

55
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,105
has to come to this place
during this particular period.

56
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:55,319
The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan
rests on the outcome of this mission...

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,697
We need to get our hands on
a Bikochu, no matter what!

58
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,663
This is a female bikochu.

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,624
Pound its characteristics into your heads.

60
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,167
Okay!

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,460
Got it.

62
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,421
Hey, I've seen this thing before...

63
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,632
Hey, really?!

64
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,008
Where did you see it, Naruto?

65
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,552
That was...

66
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:27,434
When I inadvertently leave some food out,
they start coming out of nowhere.

67
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,187
A whole deluge of them...

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,940
So those were Bikochu...

69
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,236
If it's those things,
they should be easy to catch.

70
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,905
Hey...

71
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,365
Naruto...

72
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,951
Those are called...cockroaches.

73
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,244
Huh? Cockroaches?

74
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,081
You're comparing apples to oranges.

75
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,916
This thing is completely different!

76
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,045
They look exactly identical to me...

77
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,547
-They're not!
-They're not!

78
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,388
Depending on how one looks of it,
this could be an opportunity.

79
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,390
What do you mean, Suzumebachi?

80
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,977
It's been ten days since we came here...

81
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,355
we haven't been able to get
any leads on the Bikochu.

82
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,233
However, that kid from
the Abarame Clan might...

83
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,568
That makes sense!

84
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,821
You mean they might be able
to catch a Bikochu...

85
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,116
From their appearance,
it seems they're all Genin.

86
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,453
If they're able to catch
a Bikochu...

87
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,164
we'll just take it from them.

88
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,047
All insects look alike.

89
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,218
Insect Summoning Jutsu!

90
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,650
There aren't any...here...

91
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,635
This thing here
is different too, huh...

92
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,221
Huh?

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,695
Don't be a burden to everyone...

94
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,575
This mission
is something that I suggested...

95
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,078
so I will find it without fail!

96
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,204
Byakugan!

97
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,634
Just as I thought... it's difficult to
perceive things as small as insects.

98
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,483
Shino! Kiba!

99
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,610
Hinata...Did you notice too?

100
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,779
So...you did too?

101
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,867
I guess...they think they're hiding...

102
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,660
Unfortunately for them,

103
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,247
we have a whole array of specialists
in detecting enemies.

104
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,418
What should we do, Shino?
You're the leader of this mission.

105
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,088
If we end up in a battle,
there's the danger of involving the insects...

106
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,383
and injuring the Bikochu.

107
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,095
As long as they don't make a move,
we'll just watch them closely.

108
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,346
Got it.

109
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,224
I wonder if...Naruto noticed.

110
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,186
If he had noticed,
he would have raised a big clamor.

111
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,480
I don't want to stir things up.
So don't tell him.

112
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,107
Okay...

113
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,984
Hey, Shino! Shino!

114
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,944
I found it! I found it!

115
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,989
I'm telling you,
I found a Bikochu!

116
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,831
-He found it already?!
-That's impossible!

117
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,792
When we spent ten days searching
and couldn't find one...!

118
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,213
Awesome, Naruto...

119
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,381
Are you sure, Naruto?

120
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,507
Let me see it.

121
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,011
See...this is it, right?

122
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,518
It's exactly like the photo, right?

123
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,105
I might be an insect-hunting genius.

124
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,900
-Huh?
-Does it look the same to you?

125
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,068
Huh?

126
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,114
That's called a goliath beetle...

127
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,618
Huh?! It's not the same thing?!

128
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,462
Bikochu aren't active at night.

129
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,258
-Which means that...
-Let's call it a day then.

130
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,968
Shino... Shino!

131
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,429
I found one!
This time there's no mistake!

132
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,015
It's probably a completely
different insect again.

133
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,183
Naruto...

134
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah! There's no mistake!

135
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,407
Over here! Over here! If you don't hurry,
it'll fly off somewhere!

136
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,325
Hey, didn't you bring it with you?

137
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,619
I found one that's resting in a tree.

138
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,089
The shape of its feelers is certainly
the same as Bikochu.

139
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,799
And all the characteristics match.

140
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,760
They do, don't they?
There's no mistake it's this thing, right?!

141
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,138
B-But...Naruto...

142
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,098
This thing is different after all, isn't it?

143
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,683
Why is that?

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,980
It's not only size! How would you make
this one sniff scents?!

145
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,606
Like this!

146
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,527
This thing is called
a Fake Bikochu.

147
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,779
It has an extremely
violent temperament...

148
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,450
It gets angry if one touches its nose
and sometimes even eats humans...

149
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,534
What?

150
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,621
Huh?

151
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,348
Hey, Shino! Didn't you say
there weren't any dangerous insects!

152
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,683
Almost none... but not zero.

153
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,745
Kurobachi... Jibachi...

154
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,374
Do you really think they'll be able
to catch a Bikochu?

155
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,500
-That might be difficult...
-That might be difficult...

156
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,730
Unless I control my Chakra
more perfectly

157
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,525
I won't be able to find something
as small as an insect!

158
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,781
To come all this way and
continue training...

159
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,366
That's quite admirable...

160
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,951
The air pressure has changed.

161
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,328
That's a sure sign that
the weather will change.

162
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,999
Yeah, I realize that.

163
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,626
A wind charged with moisture
has started blowing...

164
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,295
This means
there's gonna be rainfall.

165
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,799
When it's such good weather?

166
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,385
But I can see clouds off in the distance...

167
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,511
Hinata...

168
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,724
We need to hurry.

169
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,480
Because it's said that the Bikochu
only lays an egg when it rains

170
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,150
and larva emerges from the egg
the following morning.

171
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,652
In other words,

172
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,281
if it rains today, it'll become
a mature larva tomorrow morning.

173
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,117
In view of the season,
this may well be our last chance.

174
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,203
If this chance slips by,

175
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,831
it will become impossible to search
for Sasuke using a Bikochu...

176
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,166
Sasuke...

177
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:27,140
It'll be fine.
I'll find it without fail!

178
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,370
Don't rain... Don't rain yet!

179
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,999
Damn! Where is it?!

180
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,126
Please come on out
before it rains!

181
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,461
Naruto...

182
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,466
What are we gonna do...

183
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,053
if those guys don't find
a Bikochu, Suzumebachi?

184
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,638
It was the Aburame Clan

185
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,141
who was the catalyst in
the downfall of the Kamizuru Clan...

186
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,271
In order to avenge our clan's
longstanding grudge...

187
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,981
we will finish them off!

188
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,199
Those guys...
They haven't made a move yet.

189
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:30,579
They must know that we're searching
for the Bikochu.

190
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:34,291
Which means that they must be waiting
for us to find one.

191
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,337
I see...So their plan is to steal it
from us once we've found one...

192
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,674
What cheapskates...

193
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,683
Rain...

194
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,649
Not this one either!

195
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,444
Damn! When I told it not to rain!

196
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,034
There's no more time...

197
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,663
Don't be a burden to everyone...

198
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,461
So ultimately...
I contributed nothing.

199
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,381
There's still plenty of time!

200
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,181
Naruto...

201
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:36,061
I will not go back on my word...
That's my Way of Ninja!

202
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,192
That's right...

203
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,862
This mission is something
I suggested!

204
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,783
When Naruto hasn't given up,
what's up with me giving up?!

205
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,867
Hinata!

206
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,290
This rain may be
very advantageous to you.

207
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,459
What do you mean?

208
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,921
When the surrounding temperature cools,

209
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,256
living creatures become
easier to discern.

210
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,182
Naruto, I won't give up either!

211
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,101
Byakugan!

212
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,776
I have to...
I have to concentrate more...

213
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,536
I need to... I need to...
control my Chakra!

214
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,623
I can see them!
So those are insects!

215
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,920
That insect...is wrong...

216
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,674
This insect is wrong too.

217
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,592
That's...!

218
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,930
There it is!

219
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,269
Naruto! On the side of that tree!
There's a Bikochu there!

220
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,087
-I caught it!
-We did it...!

221
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,465
I did it! I caught it!

222
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,889
There's no mistake.
It's a female Bikochu.

223
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,767
-Yes! I did it!
-Cripes...

224
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,894
Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!

225
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,103
That's so great, Naruto!

226
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,355
Hinata! It's thanks to you!

227
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,818
Naruto...is...hugging me...!

228
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,740
What's the matter, Akamaru?

229
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,411
-All right! It's an egg!
-It laid an egg, huh...

230
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,622
Really?

231
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,124
It will emerge by tomorrow...

232
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,378
So then we should make it
recognize Sasuke's scent, right?!

233
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:14,010
Sasuke... I'll find you without fail!

234
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,728
It looks like they finally found one...

235
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,065
-The time has come, hasn't it?
-Yeah...

236
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,867
That Naruto... He suddenly...

237
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,537
pressed his face so close to mine...

238
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,753
So...you were able
to dodge that one just now.

239
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,216
That was pretty well done
for a Genin.

240
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,178
They're the ones who've
been trailing us all this time...

241
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,974
However, I wonder if you'll be able
to escape from this attack?

242
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,477
Ninja Art...Honey Jutsu!

243
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,563
Bees?!

244
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,285
No... that's...!

245
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,874
It looks like you've noticed, huh.
That's honey.

246
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,835
Honey that adheres like a bonding agent!

247
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,384
I used up all my Chakra earlier...

248
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,143
That thing is a real bee.

249
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,188
Naruto...

250
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,242
What do you think, Akamaru?

251
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,162
I see...

252
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,832
I was convinced that those guys
would make some kind of move.

253
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,001
There hasn't been any sign
of them since earlier on...

254
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,087
There's a possibility that
we've overlooked something.

255
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,924
Hey, Naruto!

256
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,842
-Huh?
-Where's Hinata?

257
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,677
She said she was gonna
go wash her face.

258
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,137
Hmm...

259
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,099
But it's been quite some time.
I wonder what she's doing?

260
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,810
-Could it be that...?!
-Huh? What?

261
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,521
-Naruto!
-Wha...?!

262
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,611
-A letter on a Kunai?
-Huh?!

263
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,032
We are holding the Kunoichi
brat hostage.

264
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,450
If you want to get her back,

265
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,577
it'll be in exchange for
the Bikochu.

266
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,997
Come to the top of
the eastern hill later tonight.

267
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
Damn! So that was their move!

268
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,002
Hinata...!

269
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,153
Crappy news pass us by

270
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,657
And you become speechless

271
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,496
My voice is way too soft

272
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,749
So you don't answer

273
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

274
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

275
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,929
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

276
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

277
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,188
Yeah

278
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:59,986
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

279
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,698
Yeah

280
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:09,370
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

281
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,082
Yeah

282
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:18,796
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

283
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,761
Yeah

284
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,026
Damn! We've run out of options!

285
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,194
It's too soon to give up.

286
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,571
But we don't even know
where Hinata is?!

287
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,784
No, there's one place Hinata
is sure to appear.

288
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,286
I get it! The place where
the exchange will take place!

289
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,579
We have one chance.

290
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,456
Awright! I'll do it!

291
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,877
I'll protect Hinata and
the Faint Scent Beetle without fail!

292
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,965
Next episode: "A Battle of Bugs!
The Deceivers and the Deceived!"
