1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,589
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:12,096
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,498
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,395
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,904
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,496
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:36,180
The Powerful Helper

17
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,982
Old Man Genno...

18
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,489
Yes, this is very tasty.

19
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,115
Didn't I tell you?

20
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,119
Why'd he do something like this?

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,583
Now this Paper Bomb device
won't activate.

22
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,252
Excellent, Tenten.

23
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,087
Now we can sigh with relief.

24
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,090
No, it's still too soon to be relieved.

25
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,801
Right...When Genno realizes that

26
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,053
the explosive device here
has been removed...

27
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,306
he might activate
the Paper Bombs with

28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,517
some other method and blow up the Leaf.

29
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,437
Oh, right.

30
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,485
You jerk. Don't scare me like that, Choji!

31
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,611
Sorry.

32
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,075
At the moment,
it seems there's no one here

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,035
who's picked up on our movements.

34
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,956
All right, then put things back
the way they were.

35
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,040
Got it.

36
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,876
Now then...

37
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,673
You guys do the Kunai Knife practice
like before.

38
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,091
Don't hit the center.

39
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,467
We know.

40
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:59,597
But we were sure lucky...
Nobody hit the center.

41
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,183
But I hit it right in the center yesterday.

42
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,311
I bet you were off by a little.

43
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,062
What? I don't know about that..

44
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,106
It hit, I tell you.

45
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,193
To think there'd be this many.

46
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:17,031
Lady Tsunade, let's evacuate
the villagers as quickly as possible.

47
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,408
Hey, you're joking, right?

48
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,659
What do you mean?

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,121
If you do that, Genno might...

50
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,498
blow up the remaining Paper Bombs

51
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,710
right under the cover
of the evacuation confusion.

52
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,963
I see.

53
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,884
Naruto and the others are removing
the Paper Bombs now.

54
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,344
Could you wait for their report?

55
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,150
Akamaru?

56
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,364
Did you find one?

57
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:03,786
There it is!

58
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,870
All right!

59
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,914
Attaboy, Akamaru.

60
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,294
How's it coming?

61
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,545
Just a little more.

62
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,467
Yes!

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,969
I leave the rest to you.

64
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,053
Leave it to me.

65
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,064
Did you get it yet, Naruto?

66
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,941
Just a little more.

67
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,403
Just a little more, I tell you.

68
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,446
H-Hang in there, Naruto.

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,991
Damn it, you little...

70
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,619
Hey, what're you guys doing?

71
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,330
Oh, umm...

72
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,708
Some money got into the opening.

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,460
Oh, I'll get it out for you later.

74
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,546
No, no. That'd be dangerous...

75
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,717
I mean, there's no time to waste with
eating ramen.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,801
Th-That's right.

77
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,263
Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn't it?
Well, hang in there.

78
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,931
Yeah, thank you.

79
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,016
Thanks.

80
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,227
Phew, we got through it well.

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,687
Excellent, Naruto.

82
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,942
We'd like more manpower.

83
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,195
It takes too long just with us.

84
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,323
But there aren't any other Shinobi
left in the village.

85
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,452
Well, there are some here, though.

86
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,454
People of leisure who do nothing
but tell about old stories and

87
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,541
complain about
what the young people do.

88
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,502
Huh?
Could they be...?

89
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,213
Did you get that foul mouth from
the Third Hokage?

90
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:44,094
It's the job of us advisors to
give advice to the youngsters.

91
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,555
What's wrong with complaining?

92
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:51,226
It seems you have a good nose for
village crises due to your longevity.

93
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,147
You're plenty older than
you look yourself.

94
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,525
Wh-What did you say? You old bag!

95
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,697
Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.

96
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:09,161
We've grasped most of the situation.
Where should we head to?

97
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,414
Then there's a place
I've been saving for you.

98
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,625
Oh ho. I can't wait.

99
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,710
To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.

100
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,504
That's a powerful supporter.

101
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,588
Wow.

102
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,090
But scary.

103
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,512
Hurry! Youth, full power!

104
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,806
The enemy's in the Leaf!

105
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,396
I appreciate it,
but I can't stand those two.

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,774
But the removal operation
will proceed swiftly

107
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:43,403
once Guy Senpai and the others who
headed for the Hidden Waterfall get back.

108
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,156
It'll be nice if things were to
go conveniently like that, but...

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,575
Shikamaru, have you got something?

110
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,494
I mean, it's not kid stuff.

111
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,748
When and how the hell
did he set them?

112
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:59,253
There are too many Paper Bombs.
An abnormal amount of it.

113
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,505
No doubt about it.
Uh-huh.

114
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,758
And there's one more thing
bugging me.

115
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:11,014
We're overlooking something huge...
I really get that feeling.

116
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,185
Almost.

117
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,438
What're you doing?
You're not supposed to hit the center.

118
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,399
That's right.

119
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,068
I'm next. I'll miss.

120
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,863
In your case,
you'll probably miss even if you aim.

121
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,616
How's it going, Neji?

122
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,411
The Paper Bomb removal operation
is going smoothly.

123
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,455
I don't see anyone
resembling Genno either.

124
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,041
I wonder where the enemy is.

125
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,507
Making us walk all the way to
the outskirts of town.

126
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,218
She must've gotten this slave driver
treatment from the Third Hokage.

127
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,264
A place that wouldn't be unusual
for old people to tell old stories.

128
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,434
I'll rake her over the coals
when we get back.

129
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,396
But what is that Genno fellow thinking?

130
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,609
There's no point to setting
Paper Bombs in a place like this.

131
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,736
Is that what you really think?

132
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,862
What?

133
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,488
There was a plan to build

134
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,158
a shopping district
around here before, right?

135
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,994
That talk was over thirty years ago.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,001
Hmm?!

137
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,391
What's this?

138
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,102
H-Hey, isn't that...?

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,520
Yes.

140
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,486
Look at this.

141
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,695
What is it?

142
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,909
The Jutsu form written here is different.

143
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:54,993
You're right.

144
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,954
Now that you mention it, there's no doubt.

145
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,498
It looks the same to me, though.

146
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,541
Where are your eyes pointing?

147
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,669
It's the first time I've seen this.

148
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,797
It's nothing new to us.

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,675
Speaking of Paper Bombs,
that's what they were in the old days.

150
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,678
Then this is an old version?

151
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,472
It seems most of the Paper Bombs

152
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,641
that have been set in
the village are of that type.

153
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,143
Everyone, please look closely once more

154
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,604
at the locations where
the Paper Bombs were set.

155
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,816
Although this is
a residential area here,

156
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,026
there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.

157
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,363
On the other hand,
a large number of Paper Bombs

158
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,448
have been set in places
where hardly anyone lives.

159
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,409
What does that mean?

160
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,411
In the old plans,

161
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,871
that was supposed to become
a bustling shopping district.

162
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,915
What? Could that be...?

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,126
If you think about it putting together
various factors

164
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,919
such as the antique Paper Bombs,

165
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,381
the places where they were set
and such...

166
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,845
This is a trap that was
set thirty years ago.

167
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,058
Thirty years ago...

168
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:06,565
It's just ridiculous.
Not one person noticed in thirty years.

169
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,233
It's a blind spot.

170
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,651
Nobody would ever think

171
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,947
that this many Paper Bombs would
be set here in this village.

172
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,366
Once buried in a wall,

173
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,536
it couldn't be found unless Byakugan
or something was used.

174
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,456
Then you mean
the Genno guy tried to use

175
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,126
the Paper Bombs someone
set thirty years ago?

176
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,545
But how did he find them?

177
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,007
Thirty years ago?
Could it be...?!

178
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,134
Shikamaru, where are you going?

179
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,969
Hey! Wait up.

180
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,559
We're finished here, too

181
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,227
Let's go to the next spot, Hinata.

182
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,312
Right.

183
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,776
Hinata!
What's the matter?

184
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,070
I was using the Byakugan the whole time,

185
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,156
so I'm just a little tired...
I'm fine.

186
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,240
Are you sure?

187
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,825
Let me see.
Oh.

188
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,870
You're kind of feverish.
Your face is red, too.

189
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,830
No, it's not like that.

190
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,249
I'll be okay if I just rest a little...

191
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,544
Really? Then I'll deliver
the Paper Bombs

192
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,463
we've gathered thus far
to Grandma Tsunade,

193
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,882
so you wait here.
Okay.

194
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,302
I'll be right back!

195
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,433
Ichiraku Ramen

196
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:31,191
The old man was standing here
the first time I met him.

197
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,702
I thought he was just
a ramen-loving old man, but...

198
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,457
Hm?

199
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,462
Could it be that what
he was looking at then was...?

200
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,491
Why in a place like this?

201
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,826
Well well...

202
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,497
So you found it, huh?

203
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,459
Old man?

204
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,632
I guess I cannot let you
go back now, can I?

205
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,135
Thirty years ago, huh?

206
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,346
That's around the time when
my dad was still the master carpenter.

207
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,931
It was probably a time

208
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,601
when many outsiders were hired
just like now.

209
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,563
But I wonder if there are records
from back then.

210
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,983
Anything would be fine.
A blueprint or a ledger.

211
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,195
Hey, Shikamaru.
What're you talking about? Explain.

212
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,489
Why did the referral vanish?

213
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,117
Referral? You mean the real referral

214
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,537
that became the catalyst for
Genno being suspected?

215
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,873
It was bugging me the whole time.

216
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,752
Perhaps the disappearance of
the referral was Genno's doing.

217
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,004
But why was it necessary
to get rid of it?

218
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,007
It all makes sense
if we consider the referral

219
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,218
that disappeared was a fake.

220
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,178
What do you mean?

221
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,849
But that referral was always here.

222
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,476
So it was Genno himself

223
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,564
who came here to work with
that referral thirty years ago.

224
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,941
Oh!

225
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,443
That is to say...probably.

226
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,070
At that time, he used a referral

227
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,948
that couldn't be distinguished
from the real thing.

228
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,367
And then he went to the trouble
of making one

229
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,245
that would be recognized as
a fake if compared with that one.

230
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,454
Why?

231
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,540
Even with old referrals,

232
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,667
he would be discovered
if reinvestigated again.

233
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,337
So he got rid of it right after
you blew the whistle on him.

234
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:02,092
In order to conceal the fact that
he worked here thirty years ago.

235
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,553
It's because at that time in the village,

236
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,640
he set as many Paper Bombs
as were available.

237
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,601
Why?

238
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,937
Why'd you do such a thing?!

239
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,231
Long ago, there was a village

240
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,359
called Kagero Village in
the Land of Mountains.

241
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,362
This is the village where I was born.

242
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,323
Kagero Village?

243
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,700
You don't know it?

244
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,784
No...

245
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,495
The only thing recorded in
the Bingo Book you brought

246
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,291
is that Genno's homeland is
the Land of Mountains.

247
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,669
To be precise, Kagero Village
in the Land of Mountains.

248
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,754
The village itself vanished,

249
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,798
so it probably ended up
not being recorded.

250
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,009
Thirty years ago,

251
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:48,138
the Village Hidden in Leaves
and Kagero Village were at war.

252
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:54,102
Neither side didn't give an inch
and the battle was in deadlock.

253
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,479
We launched a successful sneak attack
on Kagero Village,

254
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,065
taking advantage of the absence
of their main forces.

255
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,529
The tide of the war turned to
the Leaf's advantage in one shot.

256
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,618
The only thing written
in the history books

257
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,079
is that an armistice was concluded
three months after that.

258
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,291
These three months are what's peculiar.

259
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,502
Kagero Village should've been thinking
about a counterattack

260
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,254
before accepting a cease fire.

261
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,259
Here it is.
It's my dad's diary from thirty years ago.

262
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,552
Really?

263
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,472
Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.

264
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,349
Here.
Thanks.

265
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,144
"A middle-aged man from
the Hidden Sand came

266
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,521
"with a master carpentry referral."

267
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,817
"His skills aren't great, but I decided
to hire him as I want manpower."

268
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,863
The date is one week after
the Kagero Village attack.

269
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,198
Then sure enough...

270
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,409
Checkmate. This is Genno.

271
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,371
It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf

272
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:59,834
and to set Paper Bombs
throughout the village.

273
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,629
The operation was for the main forces
of Kagero Village

274
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,091
to invade the Village Hidden
in the Leaves at the same time

275
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,637
as the Paper Bomb explosions
and inflict a devastating blow.

276
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,933
I went out to various sites and
set Paper Bombs.

277
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,396
The village wasn't as filled with
Anbu Black Ops as it is now.

278
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,274
So I was able to move about with ease.

279
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,822
Right around the time when
two and a half months had passed,

280
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,199
I finished setting almost all
of the Paper Bombs...

281
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,161
and all that was left was to wait
for my comrades to attack.

282
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,624
But my comrades never came.

283
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,584
Why?

284
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,797
The leader of Kagero Village who
had insisted on "do-or-die" resistance;

285
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,049
lost his life in an accident.

286
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,176
And the man who assumed
the position of leader in his place

287
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,470
agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.

288
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,596
What?

289
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,393
Genno doesn't show up at the scene.
I wonder what the deal is.

290
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,020
He disappeared having left
behind the Paper Bombs.

291
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:06,401
As for me, my intention was to
immediately return to the Hidden Leaf.

292
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,029
I thought the ceasefire would just
be a temporary thing anyway.

293
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:15,994
But Kagero Village would never
give me another mission.

294
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,079
Two weeks after the ceasefire,

295
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,498
the Hidden Valley Village launched
a sneak attack on Kagero Village

296
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,209
and it was destroyed.
No way!

297
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,961
They were targeted at a moment

298
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,672
when they were weariest from
the battle with the Leaf.

299
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,134
Their defenses were probably
also down due to the ceasefire.

300
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,344
Two months after that...

301
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,055
Where did Genno disappear off to...?

302
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,896
Then why come back to the Leaf Village
now after all this time?

303
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,441
It's because setting the Paper Bombs
was your mission, right?

304
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,568
If Kagero Village is no more,

305
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,863
then there should be no reason
to go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!

306
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,326
Could it be...someone asked you
to smash the Leaf?

307
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,744
Rest easy.

308
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,414
I haven't been commissioned
or commanded by anyone.

309
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,832
Then why?

310
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,798
How can I put this? It felt like a waste.

311
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,050
A waste? What's up with that?

312
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,304
I'm getting old and I could be taken
to heaven any time now.

313
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,598
If I were to die as is,

314
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:23,853
I'd be buried in darkness without
anyone learning of my traps.

315
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:29,275
If so, then I thought I'd put them
to good use before I die.

316
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,610
Are you serious?

317
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,865
You tried to kill people in the village
just for that reason?

318
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,452
I can't believe that!

319
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,248
Then treating me to ramen was to...

320
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,460
It was to find out

321
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,587
about the present state
of affairs in the Leaf.

322
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:55,093
Damn you! You jerk!

323
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,512
You'll understand when you get older!

324
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,181
I don't understand!
As for me...

325
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,809
I won't ever understand it!

326
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:08,231
I'll show you my final big job
as a trap practitioner!

327
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,149
No way will I let you do that!

328
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,363
My friends are now in the middle
of removing all the Paper Bombs!

329
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,324
I won't let the bombs blow up!

330
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,829
Sounds like quite a struggle.

331
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,291
But who said I was going to
blow up the Paper Bombs?

332
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,795
What're you talking about?
You just said that before you die...

333
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,717
I said I would put them to good use.
You're naïve, boy.

334
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,093
What?

335
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,806
I can put them to sufficiently good use
even without blowing them up.

336
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,182
Katsu!

337
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,981
A Shinobi reads two
or three moves ahead

338
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,609
and prepares several moves
in advance.

339
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,068
Remember that!

340
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,242
Shikamaru!

341
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,952
What is it?

342
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,914
The Academy students are saying
they're tired.

343
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,541
What should we do?
The Academy students?

344
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,501
The Kunai Knife practice, right?

345
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,837
What? They were still doing that?

346
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,840
You idiot! You were the one
who had them do it.

347
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:20,261
Oh, oh yeah. Then have them
go ahead wrap things up.

348
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,557
Rather, it'd be trouble if they were
to get lucky and hit the center.

349
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,017
Oh!

350
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,393
What is it?

351
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,563
I get. So that's it!

352
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,274
It's unnatural for a guy so prepared

353
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,945
to casually entrust the
final explosive device to pure luck.

354
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,696
What do you mean?

355
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,202
A Shinobi of Genno's level should blow
it up with the most effective timing.

356
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,370
In other words,

357
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,457
it doesn't matter whether
the Paper Bombs explode or not.

358
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,459
It's just a diversion.

359
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,087
He's really after something else!

360
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,956
On a checkerboard night

361
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,667
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

362
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,714
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

363
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,050
Suggestively

364
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:45,388
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

365
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:51,728
The Trombone gradually going off-key

366
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,982
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

367
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:03,114
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

368
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:08,703
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

369
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,776
Choji, things might get pretty ugly.

370
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,985
You've figured something out, huh?

371
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,653
We need to contact
the Fifth Hokage immediately.

372
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,864
To not let the returning forces
enter the village.

373
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,741
Got it! But... Why?

374
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,660
If the Paper Bombs were
all a diversion,

375
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,162
then the moment he makes his move

376
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,081
is most likely whe
the main forces return!

377
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,207
What?!

378
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,167
Shikamaru! Choji! We've got trouble!

379
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,376
What happened, Hinata?!

380
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,629
Naruto... Naruto's in trouble!

381
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,924
Next time: "Multiple Traps!
Countdown to Destruction"
