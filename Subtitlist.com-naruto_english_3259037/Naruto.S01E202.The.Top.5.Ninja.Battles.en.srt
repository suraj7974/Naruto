1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,837
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,715
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:11,846
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,367
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,162
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,331
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,801
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,520
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:06,817
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,029
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,531
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:18,537
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,474
All right, thanks for waiting!

17
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,227
The Special: "Just Before Naruto Moves!
Presentation Today!

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,979
"The Top 5 Famous
Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!

19
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,399
"There Are Also Fun Extras"
has finally started!

20
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,777
Isn't this exciting, Sakura?!

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,154
Yes, from the next episode,

22
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,115
"Naruto" which you've all
been supporting

23
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,451
will move to Thursdays at 7:30 p.m.

24
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,496
And so today,
we're changing our plans

25
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,833
to present you with
famous battle scenes

26
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,294
in the order determined by
votes from the guys in the Leaf!

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,257
Is that favorite battle you want
to see again included?

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,259
We've also invited
some special guests,

29
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,010
so don't miss it!

30
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,388
Then, we'll be moving on ahead.

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,725
First, check out fifth and
fourth place back to back!

32
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,608
FIFTH PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~

33
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,819
Ooooh, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

34
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,529
Just what you'd expect of me,
the hero!

35
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,406
To think I'd appear right at the start.

36
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,158
I've shrewdly got everyone's hearts!

37
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,077
Yaaaaah, you're right!

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
To be honest,

39
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,915
the coolness of Sasuke in motion
is unfathomable.

40
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,334
Outstanding destructive power.
Cha!

41
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,004
Umm, Sakura?

42
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,381
Our comments aren't meshing
right off the bat.

43
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,216
Just keep quiet!

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,301
Right.

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,556
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

46
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,775
Attack and defense with
no time to breathe.

47
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,736
This is gripping.

48
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,530
Throw in a kick there!

49
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,535
Beat down and thrash up!

50
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:27,625
Umm, Sakura. How about
a little support for the hero there...?

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,126
Shut up, Naruto!

52
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,592
Naruto Barrage!

53
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,556
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

54
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,690
Wh-What's that Jutsu?!

55
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,322
You jerk!

56
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,741
Chidori!!

57
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,244
Stop it...you two...

58
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,124
Stop it!

59
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,636
That's mean to punch me all
of a sudden, Sakura!

60
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,430
I couldn't help it.
I got excited.

61
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,017
FOURTH PLACE
CHOJI VS. JIROBO
~FATSO VS. FATSO~
Now, let's collect ourselves
and check out fourth place next!

62
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,854
It's too late whatever you do now!

63
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,189
Crushing Palm!

64
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,280
Man, this battle moves me to tears,
no matter how often I watch it.

65
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,408
That's right! As it happens,

66
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,035
I sat down on my knees in front of
the TV while blowing my nose.

67
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,998
It invoked tears in the living rooms
in the Land of Fire for sure.

68
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,460
I really thought Choji had died
in this episode.

69
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,878
That's for sure.

70
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,215
I was also totally fooled
by the producers.

71
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,801
Wh-What's that...?

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,470
But...

73
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,931
Boulder Blow!

74
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,601
It's futile!

75
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,857
I'm a hundred times stronger
than before!

76
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,034
They say a grudge over food
is ferocious, right?

77
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,036
That one punch just now

78
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,707
was the grudge for you eating
the last bite of the snack.

79
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:36,670
No way! He's got so much Chakra
his build has changed!

80
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,797
And this is...

81
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,345
This is for insulting me by calling me
a sacrificial piece and fat!

82
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,516
But what's most unforgivable is

83
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:53,479
you insulting my best friend!

84
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:59,818
That's more unforgivable than
swiping the last bite of gourmet food

85
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,866
or insulting me by calling me fat!

86
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,830
All my Chakra...
to my left hand!

87
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,707
O-Oh, no...!

88
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,128
This one punch is heavier than life!

89
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,215
W-Wait...!
Don't be hasty...!

90
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:35,938
But seeing it again,
visually it's just fat versus fat.

91
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,817
No appealing parts at all
and the screen is stifling.

92
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,194
I mean, no way would I want
to see this during the summer

93
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,530
Excuse me for being stifling.

94
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,698
Yikes! Choji.

95
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,783
How long were you there...?

96
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,203
I heard my famous battle made it
into the top five, you see...

97
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,287
Oh wait, Choji.

98
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,997
– You'll understand once I tell you!
– Calm down!

99
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,500
Spiky Human Boulder

100
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:10,055
I won... I actually...won!

101
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,770
We had a bit of an incident here,

102
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,148
but let's not worry about that
and move on.

103
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,234
Now before we present
third to first place,

104
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,988
we'll show the famous battles
left out of the top five.

105
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,408
Is the famous battle
you chose included?

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,659
Now then, here we go!

107
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,743
EXTRA SEGMENT
UNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES

108
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,248
KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA
~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~

109
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,583
– Rooster!
– Rooster!

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,170
– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,007
Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei's
Sharingan is super unfair!

112
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,342
Just what you'd expect from a Jonin.

113
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,316
KAKASHI VS. GAI
~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~

114
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,901
– What?!
– You're late!

115
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,319
– This is a famous battle?!
– You're seventeen minutes

116
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,778
– Well, it's cool to have stuff like this
– and thirty two seconds late!

117
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,280
– included once in a while, right?
– Let's forget about today...

118
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,949
We both have forty eight wins!

119
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,493
One of us will move ahead
with this battle!

120
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,957
It seems it won't work
even if I say no...

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,462
This time it's my turn to determine
the battle category...

122
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,049
What will it be?
A Taijutsu fight?

123
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,300
A 100-meter dash?

124
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,762
Skin diving? I wouldn't mind
an eating contest...

125
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,388
Listen, you...

126
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,474
Well then...

127
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,226
Wh-What?!

128
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,603
Rock-paper-scissors!

129
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,564
I accept the challenge.
No way will I lose!

130
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,192
If I lose, I'll do five hundred laps

131
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,319
around the Leaf Village
standing on my head!

132
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,029
Absurdity again...

133
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,739
It's a promise!

134
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,993
Here we go again...
His favorite own rules.

135
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,333
Okay, everyone together now.

136
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,210
– One-two!
– One-two!

137
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,419
Three.

138
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,632
After the commercial,
we'll present third to first place.

139
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,050
Don't miss it.

140
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,390
Now at last for the presentation
of third to first place.

141
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,141
First up is third place!

142
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,979
Now then, which battle has worked
its way up to the higher ranks?

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,776
Here we go! The appearance of
the famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!

144
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,860
– Heh!
– Damn it...

145
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,112
– It's the appearance of
– Is it all over...?

146
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,155
a team that's just loud.

147
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,867
What?!
You're saying to do that?!

148
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,453
No, Akamaru!

149
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,873
It's too dangerous to do that
without any comrades around!

150
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,875
You understand that, don't you?!

151
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,754
We'll die like dogs here if we miss...

152
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,339
Ow!

153
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,386
Akamaru...

154
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:06,023
To think I'd get bitten by you.
I'm a pathetic owner...

155
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,362
Okay, Akamaru...
As you say, we just have to do that...

156
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,574
Fang Over Fang!

157
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,713
Now, Akamaru!

158
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,715
What?!

159
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,301
Show him the fruits of our training!

160
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,386
Dynamic Marking!

161
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,348
That's a dirty act!

162
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,142
Now we're ready!

163
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,563
Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast
Transformation Combo!

164
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,242
Two-Headed Wolf!

165
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,913
Eat this!

166
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,629
Sakon, what're you doing! To the right!

167
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,172
Uh oh...!

168
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,840
Fang Over Fang!

169
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,552
Though he sometimes bites
his owner's hand,

170
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,887
he presses for a decision.

171
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,849
It seems Akamaru's stock shot up
in the Leaf after this.

172
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,559
Oooh, what a man.

173
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:31,191
Man, my butt! Just a puppy
whose evil eyes got worse!

174
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,652
Who has evil eyes?!

175
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,529
Yikes, Kiba!

176
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,116
H-How long were you there...?

177
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,700
Knock it off!

178
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,244
Here I was invited as a guest

179
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,162
with my battle
having been ranked high.

180
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,039
What's the deal of
finishing in third place

181
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,250
on top of being told mean things?!

182
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,213
It's Kiba and Akamaru
who finished in third.

183
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,589
Please face the camera

184
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,801
and say a few words to everyone
in their living rooms.

185
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,930
Oh, umm, thanks for your support.

186
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,474
Well, we came in third this time.

187
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,854
But we'll kick the butts of some enemies,

188
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,523
so please look forward
to our success!

189
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,943
Considering you're talking
all big or whatever,

190
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,737
didn't you have a rough time
with it after this?

191
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,198
The best is yet to come,
I tell you!

192
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,369
That's the last straw.
Get him, Akamaru!

193
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,585
Now for the presentation
of second place.

194
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,387
He's like a completely different person...

195
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,265
His Chakra activity is overwhelming...

196
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,019
And those markings...

197
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,236
The movements earlier...

198
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,697
He dodged the attack from behind

199
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,450
and saw me hiding in the shadows...

200
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:09,164
In other words, he's combining
wide vision and x-ray vision.

201
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,084
And in addition, that Jutsu...

202
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,003
Then...

203
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,550
Summoning Jutsu!

204
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:34,856
I'll find a perfect...
way to attack that power of yours.

205
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,783
If he defends physical attacks
with rotation

206
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,244
and a large emission of Chakra...

207
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,956
then I should stop that Chakra rotation!

208
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,794
– This is the second place battle?
– Scatter!

209
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,380
That's right! It's a battle of brains while
assessing the opponent's weak point!

210
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,215
Hmm. But as for me...

211
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,884
I'm not a big fan of sluggish battles!

212
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,761
– Oh, why?
– Hmm.

213
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,097
How can I put it?
If you're talking about battle

214
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,976
I want to see a collision of fist
on fist, and body on body.

215
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,979
Oh, but a Ninja isn't just
about Taijutsu.

216
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,023
Oh. That's being rude to Bushy Brow.

217
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,108
Oh, sorry.

218
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,026
I mean, yeah, I want to see

219
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,487
something fiery, like Bushy Brow!

220
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,157
There just isn't anything fiery
in Neji's battles.

221
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,367
Here!

222
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,703
He's argumentative or something.

223
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,204
Unexciting or something.

224
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,708
I'd like him to just take on the enemy
without regard to appearances!

225
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,588
Heh! Missions with you are
a chore because you think like that.

226
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,631
Yikes, Neji!

227
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:46,636
Now then, a few words from
the second place Neji.

228
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,972
Humph! How silly.

229
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,475
You're free to evaluate my battles,
but it's unthinkable

230
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,104
for me to be forced to appear
in a place like this.

231
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:00,108
Heh! You're sure making
an exhibition of yourself, considering!

232
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,445
Oh! Could it be you're after
an appearance fee?!

233
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,864
Too bad.

234
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,200
This is a program for everyone
in their living rooms,

235
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,328
so we asked you to do this for free!

236
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,207
No problem.
I asked the Fifth Hokage

237
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,293
and she's treating this appearance
as a mission.

238
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,962
Since it's a mission,
I have no choice but to appear.

239
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,548
And of course, a mission fee
will be incurred.

240
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,052
Whoa, always the realist.

241
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,513
Neji, it's not fair that
you get paid for this!

242
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,559
My brain is built differently than yours!

243
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,521
Gentle Fist!

244
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,195
It seems the ranking board is busted,

245
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,989
so we'll go right on ahead
and present first place.

246
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,950
Which battle has finished in first?

247
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,290
Chidori!

248
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,918
Oh ho! Sure enough, it's pointless

249
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,213
if the number one battle
isn't one of my battles!

250
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,256
That's right!
This is the battle that

251
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,592
anyone would
acknowledge as number one.

252
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,220
Rasengan!

253
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,708
– Rasengan!
– Chidori!

254
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,294
And so, did you all guess right?

255
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,465
The glorious best battle has been
determined to be "Sasuke's Battle!"

256
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:33,386
Hey, hey, Sakura.
It's the "Battle in the Final Valley"!

257
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,513
FIRST PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~FINAL VALLEY~
What? Was it?

258
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,308
Forget it.

259
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,478
Well, let's collect ourselves
and check out

260
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:46,691
some special footage of myself,
who came in a glorious first place!

261
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,610
Y-You...idiot!

262
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,698
Hold it!
What's up with this recording?!

263
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,242
– This is different from what I prepared!
– What're you doing?!

264
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,620
– No, no, don't watch!
– Don't be peeping!

265
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,831
I demand a do-over as the hero!

266
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,083
Someone not involved is
making a ruckus.

267
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,045
And now, thanks for waiting!

268
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,088
Now for the appearance of
a special guest.

269
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,551
Let's go live to the site.
Master Jiraiya!

270
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,844
What? What?

271
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,805
Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?

272
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,140
Yes... Loud and clear.

273
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,433
What?

274
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,394
Master Jiraiya,
where are you right now?

275
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,731
Mm, I'm in kind of a dubious place.

276
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,068
I hope you'll excuse me from
divulging my location.

277
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,402
Well, if I have to say something,

278
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,489
I'd say I'm in a certain person's
hideout, I guess.

279
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,827
Hey! Pervert Mountain Hermit!
What're you doing there?!

280
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,663
What happened to you
watching my training?!

281
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,290
Now, now.
Today's a special program,

282
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,501
so don't be such a stick-in-the-mud.

283
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,129
More importantly,
I've met up with someone special...

284
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,382
None other than Orochimaru.

285
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,551
What?!

286
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,846
Sakura...
What the hell is this...?!

287
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,349
It sure has been a long time,
Orochimaru!

288
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,726
Oh, same here...

289
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,813
Here you could have invited me
to the studio.

290
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,275
Who would invite the likes of you?!

291
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:16,739
Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu
and conducting experiments.

292
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:22,495
And more importantly,
I need him to get stronger quickly, so.

293
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,541
– If he's there, bring him out!
– What...?!

294
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:33,464
Actually, I tried talking him into it
many times saying today's special...

295
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,927
But in the end,
he didn't give me a good answer.

296
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,262
– I see...
– Hey.

297
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,346
What?!

298
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,640
Are you going to go
on and on forever?

299
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,895
If you've got that kind of time,
then continue the training, Orochimaru.

300
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,938
S-Sasuke...

301
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,400
Sasuke...
Is that you, Sasuke?!

302
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,155
I'll be going on ahead to the dojo.
Get a move on.

303
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, wait...!

304
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,744
Oh, it seems I've angered Sasuke.

305
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,413
I shall also be leaving now.

306
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,708
Wait! Orochimaru!
Put Sasuke on one more time...

307
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,462
Sakura...
He can't hear you anymore.

308
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,130
I know...

309
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,718
– Sakura...
– Yeah. Right!

310
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,802
That's right!

311
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,472
Now then,
it's about time to say goodbye.

312
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,933
Did you all enjoy our special:

313
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,977
"Just Before Naruto Moves!

There Are Also Fun Extras"?

316
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,527
Hey, what're you wrapping things
up on your own for?

317
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,197
What about my do-over
special footage?

318
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,740
You're annoying.

319
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,159
We don't have any time left,
so wrap things up now!

320
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,621
What?! Fine!

321
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,997
From the next episode,

322
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,750
"Naruto" will be airing on
Thursdays at 7:30 p.m.

323
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,335
So don't get mixed up!

324
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,922
Moreover, the first episode
will be a 90-minute special!

325
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,091
Even after we move...

326
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,218
– Please keep watching "Naruto"!
– Please keep watching "Naruto"!

327
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,096
SEE YOU LATER!
See you later.

328
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,039
On a checkerboard night

329
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,667
when the stardust's are rapidly dancing

330
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,422
I just can't come out and say,
"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."

331
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,550
Suggestively

332
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,138
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket

333
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:51,769
The Trombone gradually going off-key

334
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:56,065
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.

335
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:03,072
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,

336
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:09,704
I wonder if it's from
that coke I just drank?

337
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,193
I never thought that
you were so stubborn!

338
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,361
Even if you make a fuss,
nothing's going to change.

339
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,822
But, at this rate,
she's going to abandon us.

340
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,324
It's her choice.
There's nothing we can do.

341
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,326
Hey, Hinata!
What do you think?

342
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,161
We still don't know
what her situation is...

343
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,704
Does that mean that you're with Shino?!

344
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,789
It's not like that!

345
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,082
Hey, what are you fighting about?

346
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,167
Naruto, Sensei is...

347
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
Kurenai Sensei is going to quit!

348
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,381
Next time: "Kurenai's Decision:
Squad 8 Left Behind"
