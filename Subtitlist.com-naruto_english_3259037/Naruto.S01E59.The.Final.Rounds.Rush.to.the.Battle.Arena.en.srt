1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,839
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,101
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,174
and someday,

13
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:08,986
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,407
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

18
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

19
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

20
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,753
let's start walking

21
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,880
One more time

22
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,071
Tomorrow, huh...

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,411
The Final Rounds:
Rush to the Battle Arena!

24
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,009
What's up? It's been a while.

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,972
Heh-heh...
I was kind of in the hospital.

26
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,056
The hospital?

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,392
I'm totally fine, now.

28
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,310
Nothing to it!

29
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,813
I see.

30
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,692
Ayame!
Yes!

31
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,320
Here you go.

32
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,454
Pops?

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,039
Just eat it.

34
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,292
The final round is tomorrow, right?

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,173
Okay, then.

36
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,051
Thanks!

37
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,853
You've got a daughter at home,
so it's not so bad, right?

38
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,731
Most of my money vanishes
with the food expenses.

39
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,359
Moron. Your home is special, right?

40
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,444
Huh?

41
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,071
Girls are a drag.

42
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:21,535
Yeah. There are times when I really
don't get how to act with her.

43
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,914
Father's have it rough...

44
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,458
Hah, am I the only bad guy?

45
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,586
Hey, master.

46
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,131
Let me have everything
on these two pages, too!

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
Welcome!

48
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,638
Oh! Strong reinforcements!

49
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,514
Come on. You order something, too!

50
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,688
Hey...Dad.
Hmm?

51
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,149
Hey! Let's go home, already!

52
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,734
Excuse me?

53
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:58,614
Shut up. You're supposed to
live it up at a festival!

54
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,908
Festival, my butt...

55
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,535
What a drag.

56
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,039
You idiot... Since olden times...

57
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,547
the final round's
been like a festival!

58
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,467
I'm in that final round tomorrow.

59
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,637
Jeez, don't make come to get you.

60
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,975
You're...in it?

61
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,189
Please, Dad...

62
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,511
Tomorrow, eh...

63
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,347
Yeah.

64
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,487
Tomorrow...is a full moon...

65
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,252
To think you didn't even
get a scratch...

66
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,630
Perfect, eh, Neji?

67
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,134
That's enough warm-up exercise...

68
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,471
Shall we get going?

69
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,449
I was nervous and couldn't sleep.

70
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,539
First...it's him...
in the first match.

71
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,462
Quite honestly...even my Sharingan
can't see through his Tenketsu!

72
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:05,676
The strongest man in the
Leaf is on my team.

73
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,513
It is that...Neji Hyuga!

74
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,932
Neji...Neji...Neji...

75
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,002
At last...

76
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,181
The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!

77
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,142
Yeah. He's the number one rookie
from last year, right?!

78
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,144
We can't miss the first match!

79
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,691
Neji...Hyuga...

80
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:11,158
Now I can summon a frog...
It'll be okay.

81
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,166
They all...look nasty.

82
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:35,974
Hinata!

83
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,685
Yipes! N-N-Naruto.

84
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,314
W-What are you doing here?

85
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,149
Today is the final round, isn't it?

86
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,905
I... Just something...

87
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,116
I came to check out this training field.

88
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,828
This is the place where
I became Genin, so...

89
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,001
Really? W-Why?

90
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,339
N-Nothing...That doesn't matter!

91
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,676
9Y-You're right. I'm sorry.

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,097
Say, Hinata...

93
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,600
Neji's a relative of yours, right?

94
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,311
Y-Yes.

95
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,023
Is he really strong ...?

96
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:28,986
Yes...

97
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,947
I see.

98
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,826
B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.

99
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,454
Yeah. I'm strong, after all!

100
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,969
I bet you can win, Naruto.
What?

101
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,887
You know...

102
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:59,599
I...when you cheered for me,

103
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,686
I felt like I was able to become
stronger than before.

104
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,647
Hinata! Hang tough!

105
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,774
When the preliminaries ended,

106
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,652
I became able to like
myself just a little.

107
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,614
I'll...

108
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,160
stand...

109
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,539
by my own...

110
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,292
words.

111
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,339
That is my way of Ninja.

112
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:35,594
From someone else's standpoint,
it might not look like anything's changed...

113
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,140
but I feel like I was able to change.

114
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:46,271
I've been thinking that it was...
thanks to you, Naruto.

115
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,359
Say, Hinata...

116
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,030
Did you really think so?
What?

117
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,287
I may look strong to you,

118
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,291
but all I do is mess up...

119
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,212
And I act tough because
I'm frustrated.

120
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,671
It's not like that!

121
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,592
Even when you messed up,

122
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,431
in my view...you were always
a proud failure.

123
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,063
W-When I look at you,
it impacts my heart.

124
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,774
You're not perfect, so...

125
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,193
So...

126
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,238
It's because you mess up...

127
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,741
that you have the strength
to rise up from that.

128
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,789
I think such strength is
true strength.

129
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,503
I...I think you're an
incredibly strong person.

130
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,806
Thanks, Hinata!

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,770
Even though I was always
the bottom one...

132
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,731
I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!

133
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,693
I was depressed,
which was totally not my character.

134
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,446
But I feel better now!

135
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,906
Naruto...

136
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,617
Okay! I'm off to the match!

137
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,290
Hinata...

138
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,708
Huh?

139
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,879
I kind of...thought you were...

140
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,922
W-What...?

141
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:40,051
...gloomy, hesitant and weird.

142
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,470
Naruto...

143
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,848
But I quite like...people...

144
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,811
like you!

145
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,357
...like you!

146
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:07,829
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me
kick that Neji's butt!

147
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,753
Uh-oh. Time to run!

148
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,837
I-I'm late, late!

149
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,423
See you later, Hinata!

150
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,264
Sorry I'm late, Hinata.

151
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,851
Well, Shino's match isn't until
quite a bit later, so...

152
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,646
Hm? Hey? Hinata?

153
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,575
Hmm? W-What?

154
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,169
Oh, it's starting!

155
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,754
Move, move!

156
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,590
C'mon, move!

157
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,260
Dang it! There's quite a distance!

158
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,928
I won't make it!

159
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,972
Brother Naruto!

160
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,184
Konohamaru?!

161
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,646
I've come to aid in brother's crisis, here!

162
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,608
Konohamaru...
What're you doing here?!

163
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,111
I'll tell you later!
This way, here!

164
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,574
There's an ace shortcut where
you can get straight to the arena, here!

165
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,367
What?!

166
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,036
All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!

167
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,040
Those who control the
secret path control time.

168
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:38,003
Oh, I see!
You're awesome, Konohamaru!

169
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,881
As I recall, there's a hole
in the wall around here...

170
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,259
Oh!
Here it is!

171
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,803
Oh!

172
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,181
What's the matter, Konohamaru?

173
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,852
The secret path has been repaired, here!

174
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,020
Whaat...?

175
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,690
Oh! There's no time!
Brother!

176
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,483
Next approach!

177
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,653
Look! I'm really out of time.

178
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,325
It's a secret, but there's
an awesome path

179
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,828
that can get you inside the arena
in an instant, here!

180
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,333
What?! All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!

181
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,795
This hole is a shortcut?

182
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,590
It's a straight shot to
the final round arena!

183
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,300
No doubt, here!

184
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,304
Straight shot, huh?
Okay!

185
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,265
Let's hurry!
Yeah!

186
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,981
Konohamaru!
What's happening here?!

187
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,441
It's okay, here!

188
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,735
We're almost to the final
round arena, here!

189
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,946
See? There's the exit, here!

190
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,407
Oh, oh.

191
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,243
What?!

192
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,836
Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!

193
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,550
T-This is...some kind of mistake!

194
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,763
Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!

195
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,766
What the heck are you doing?!

196
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,311
We've gotten further
and further away!

197
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,230
Until just recently,

198
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,857
it was connected to the
final round arena, here.

199
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,777
Next approach, right away...

200
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,574
This is it!

201
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:40,083
If you ride this, you'll get to the
final round arena just like that, here!

202
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,795
Huh? A bull?

203
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,797
Think again, brother.

204
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,260
A feudal lord Bull is not at all in
the same league as ordinary cows, here.

205
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,722
Once they start running,
even race horses grow deathly pale.

206
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,725
There's no way they can beat
a no-nonsense feudal lord cow!

207
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,477
Anyway, it's an awesome cow!

208
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,360
Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,

209
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,447
it's just a short run to
the final round arena, here!

210
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,449
Then, I'm counting on you.

211
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,534
Okay, let's go!

212
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,333
Huh? Wha...?!

213
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,380
Ouch!

214
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,182
What?

215
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,615
Brother, go for it, here!

216
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,659
Hey! Stop! Stop!

217
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,763
Hey-hey, we're missing quite
a few people.

218
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,726
What's going on?
It's going to start.

219
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,104
What's the meaning of this?
Sasuke...?

220
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,190
And even Naruto...

221
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,033
Why is it?!

222
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,752
This is bad!

223
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:51,297
That's it!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

224
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,927
Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!

225
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,387
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

226
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,112
What's wrong with you guys?
Why are you back, hey?!

227
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,322
More appeared!

228
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,533
The escape path was blocked!

229
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,203
It won't do any good to multiply!

230
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,876
Hmm? What the...?!

231
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,294
Naruto Uzumaki...?

232
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,255
We leave the rest to you!

233
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,258
Whoa, let us in, quick!

234
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,219
Hey!
Entry has already...!

235
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,902
What kind...of entrance is
this kid making...?

236
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,948
Naruto.

237
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,076
He's totally late.

238
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,163
What a drag.

239
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:12,795
Guys, run! A large herd of
stampeding bulls is coming.

240
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,423
Huh? What are you talking about?

241
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,552
Jeez! I'm serious.
So many of them...!

242
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,768
Huh? Hey...
Where's Sasuke?

243
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,437
The Dosu guy I'm supposed
to fight isn't here, either.

244
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,272
Hey, you guys there.

245
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,232
Don't be restless.

246
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,736
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!

247
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,761
You guys are the stars of
this "final round."

248
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,441
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

249
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,903
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

250
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:22,281
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

251
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,702
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

252
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:32,083
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

253
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:38,297
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

254
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,757
Fight! Fight! Fight!

255
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,146
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

256
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,816
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

257
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,278
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

258
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,531
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

259
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:09,829
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

260
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:16,044
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

261
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,253
Fight! Fight! Fight!

262
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:23,593
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

263
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:29,682
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

264
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,642
Fight! Fight! Fight!

265
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,109
Hey Hinata!
Keep your eyes open

266
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,819
and watch me
defeat this unpleasant guy!

267
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:46,282
He goes and decides that
a person's life path can't be changed...

268
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,911
Destiny is decided when one is born?
Don't kid me!

269
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,329
People definitely can change.

270
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,333
By defeating this guy,
I'll prove that!

271
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,087
Next time,
"Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone"

272
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,673
Quit gabbing
and let's get started!
