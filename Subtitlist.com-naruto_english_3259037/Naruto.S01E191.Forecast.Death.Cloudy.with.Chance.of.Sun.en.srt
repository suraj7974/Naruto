1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,928
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,320
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,078
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,582
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,973
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,817
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:12,656
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,496
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,763
I won't count on you.

16
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,183
I will go by myself.

17
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,686
Wait.
I 'll go too.

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,984
I promised Hinata that I would definitely
protect you, Princess!

19
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,905
With Hinata...?

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,078
She fought with the second Janin
and got hurt badly...

21
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,329
Hinata did...?

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,418
You guys said that you didn't accept
the mission of protecting me.

23
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,504
Then why do you concern
yourselves with me...?

24
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,797
I...

25
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,467
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.

26
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:18,389
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad... That's all.

27
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,435
Well, let's go!

28
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,020
If we pass through
the valley ahead of us,

29
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,438
we'll get to the town.

30
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,523
If we do that,

31
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,234
they probably won't chase us
all the way there!

32
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:41,912
Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!

33
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,419
Too bad, but you guys won't
be able to reach that village.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,379
Since you guys are going
to die here!

35
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,592
Wh-Why is he floating in the air?

36
00:02:56,135 --> 00:03:02,182
Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like you
can't even imagine my Jutsu.

37
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,643
Take this!

38
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,484
Naruto!

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,112
I'm okay.

40
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,033
But what just flew at me?

41
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,869
Don't waste your time fighting me.

42
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,539
I have already captured
all three of your friends.

43
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,832
What?

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,793
Just hand over the girl.

45
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,713
If you do that I'll spare your friends.

46
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,548
Choji and Hinata...

47
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,386
So, what are you going to do kid?

48
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,600
Naruto... Are you going to
abandon me too?

49
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,687
Oh no, this princess is
telling you to save her,

50
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,106
and let your friends die.

51
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,278
Well, I don't mind that kind of thinking
since it's the same as mine.

52
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,198
Same as yours?

53
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,658
That's right.

54
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,076
If someone is useful,

55
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,995
then you should make use of them
even though they may be your siblings.

56
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,665
There is one thing I need
to thank you guys for.

57
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,376
Thank us?
For what?!

58
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,337
For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,341
I was going to put an end to them myself
sooner or later anyways.

60
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,842
What...?!

61
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,012
It was clear that they would
soon tell me,

62
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:26,141
"Big Brother, give us the property
and the money too."

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,770
Three feudal lords are not necessary
in one country.

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,523
And you still call
yourselves brothers?!

65
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,525
It doesn't matter.

66
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,318
Even though it's my parents
or my brothers.

67
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,738
I'll make use of anything I can.

68
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,326
Now, give her to me.

69
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,661
I refuse.

70
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,371
I see.

71
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,831
Naruto...

72
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,417
A person who would abandon
his siblings

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,837
would never keep his promise
with me.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,505
Well, that's true.

75
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,636
It's impossible, Naruto!

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,430
You don't even know
what kind of Jutsu it is!

77
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,473
That doesn't matter!

78
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,392
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

79
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,283
Take this!

80
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,996
What is this guy?

81
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,707
There's something hard around
his body that I can't see...

82
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,838
Naruto!

83
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:43,218
I'm sorry, but none of
your Ninjutsu work on me.

84
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,511
Not even one.

85
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,306
Damn it!

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
What?!

87
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,115
What is that?

88
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,825
Crystallized ice...?

89
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,788
I can gather water vapor in the air

90
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,750
and instantly turn it
into crystallized ice.

91
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,254
So the things that just attacked me
were ice Shuriken.

92
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,216
Man! It's hard to see
if it's transparent ice.

93
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,178
Just that is not too interesting.

94
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,434
What is this great sense
of danger?

95
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,313
I'm sure his Jutsu has already started!

96
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,774
Where is it, where is it
coming from?!

97
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,861
Kid, do you know
today's weather forecast?

98
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,613
Weather forecast?

99
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,406
Cloudy and partly sunny.

100
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,951
It's a good weather for you to die.

101
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,836
What is this?

102
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,055
What?!

103
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,641
Look out!

104
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,703
Damn it!
Naruto!

105
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,664
That's a lens!
Lens?!

106
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,169
Yup, I turned the crystallized ice
into lens

107
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,421
to gather the sunlight and shoot it.

108
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:47,843
So, I can't really control it,
but it'll be an instant when you die.

109
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,929
As soon as the battle condition
at the Land of Green is prepared,

110
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:55,309
I'll burn up the surrounding countries
with this Jutsu.

111
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,027
This way!

112
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,370
It's no use.

113
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,081
I could even see things that are
a thousand miles away.

114
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,190
I found you.

115
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,641
Naruto... Why do you protect me?

116
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,602
I wonder why...

117
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,604
I don't know either.

118
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,274
Naruto...

119
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,465
Haruna!

120
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,304
While I distract him, run!

121
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:09,026
Don't even think you guys could get away
from my Jutsu by doing that!

122
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,803
You decided to hand me
over the princess?

123
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,015
Who would hand over Haruna
to the likes of you!

124
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,142
What a fool.

125
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,353
I'm telling you that if you hand me
the selfish princess

126
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,273
and just go back to the village,
I'll let your friends go.

127
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:52,986
I promised with Hinata that
I will save Haruna!

128
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,239
Just to keep a promise
with your friend,

129
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,701
you're gonna risk your life to fight
in a hopeless battle, huh...?

130
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,957
You're just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.

131
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,627
A good-natured big fool!

132
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,756
Same as my father...?!

133
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,180
You're just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.

134
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,807
A good-natured big fool!

135
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,519
Same as my father...?!

136
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,230
This is what the feudal lord
foolishly said

137
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,149
to us who were trying to take over
the Land of Green:

138
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,320
"Please do not torment the people
in this country."

139
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,491
I beg you!
I don't care what happens to me,

140
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,326
but please promise me one thing!

141
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,205
This is a small weak country
surrounded by big countries.

142
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,542
Without the powers of the people,
the country cannot prosper!

143
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,585
In order for the country to prosper,

144
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,712
we must take care of
each individual people

145
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,507
and not sacrifice a single life!

146
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,467
I want you to consider the people
as a family

147
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,011
and not torment them.

148
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,722
I am the feudal lord!

149
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,725
It doesn't matter what I do
to the people, right?

150
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,436
That's why...

151
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,608
That's why this country has
been at peace until now!

152
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,944
Peace doesn't matter to me.

153
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,487
All I need to do is use the people
as the stepping stones

154
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,573
and feather my nest!

155
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,783
And because of that kind
of good nature,

156
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,035
his daughter was taken
as a hostage!

157
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,997
What do you mean?!

158
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,292
It seems like it was ten years ago.

159
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,089
A lot of the people were sacrificed
by the pressure of the big country...

160
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:41,887
Riots occurred in the country
and the country came close to corruption.

161
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,389
It was a bitter decision...

162
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,476
I had no choice but to let
my daughter,

163
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,145
who is more important than my life,
taken as a hostage.

164
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,732
I know that Haruna will
not forgive me...

165
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,572
A cold-hearted father who sacrificed
his own daughter

166
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,574
just for the peace of the country.

167
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,663
Why don't you ask
your daughter directly?!

168
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,540
In the after life!

169
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,754
My father was...killed!

170
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,549
What an outrageously
good-natured person, huh?

171
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,052
You're wrong,
he was a great feudal lord!

172
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,138
Naruto...

173
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,474
Listen!

174
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,684
There are two kinds of human beings
in this world.

175
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,938
Those who use others,
and those who get used!

176
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,983
In my case, I will get to
the top using anyone,

177
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,944
whether it's my parents or my friends.

178
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,863
You! I'll never forgive you!

179
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,365
Shut up!

180
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,168
D-Damn...!

181
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,887
Die!

182
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,357
Naruto...

183
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,069
You can't move anymore?!

184
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,782
You're not the one...

185
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,831
It was because of Haruna's father
that this country was peaceful...

186
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,378
The person who is going
to succeed this country is...

187
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,716
The person is...

188
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,552
Haruna!

189
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,348
Stop!

190
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,518
Stupid!
Why aren't you running away?!

191
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:58,481
Kill me! If you kill me,
your goal will be fulfilled, right?!

192
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,484
Naruto, Naruto has nothing
to do with this!

193
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,697
So both the parent and daughter
are naïve, after all.

194
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,741
Why not complain to your father
in the afterlife

195
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,452
for making you sacrifice your life
for the country?

196
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,749
How scary...

197
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,627
Y-You!

198
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,342
It's time for you to die, kid.

199
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,968
I'm not a kid!

200
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,970
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

201
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,598
I'm not going to hand over
the Land of Green

202
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,559
to a person like you!

203
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,103
Naruto!

204
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,859
Die!

205
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,700
What?!

206
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,422
No...way...

207
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,223
But kid, it's too late even
though you took me down...

208
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
The Land of Green without
a feudal lord will collapse

209
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,895
due to the war between
the large countries over its territory.

210
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,398
It's too bad,
but that's not gonna happen!

211
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,402
Shizune!

212
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,280
It's a pain,
but we came to get you guys!

213
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,657
Shikamaru!

214
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,493
But...I didn't ask you guys
to come get us!

215
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,455
But you look pretty beaten up.

216
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,582
No no, this is...

217
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,750
Naruto!

218
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,838
Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!

219
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,923
Everyone was safe!

220
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,301
Yeah. We were rescued by
the people of Leaf Village.

221
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:55,348
Huh? Oh yeah,
why are you guys here?

222
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,143
We received notice of a coup
in the Land of Green

223
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,895
and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me
to come...

224
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:06,025
Princess Haruna's father was
very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.

225
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,527
My father...?

226
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:13,491
Please forgive us, when we arrived,
your father was already...

227
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,203
I see...I've caused
so much trouble for you.

228
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,416
Damn! The position of the feudal lord
that I finally got a hold of...

229
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,420
But, then the surrounding countries
are not going to stay quiet.

230
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,921
It's okay.

231
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,506
An announcement has been sent out
to the neighboring countries

232
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,926
in the name of the next feudal lord.

233
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,179
Under your name, Princess Haruna.

234
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,307
Then we don't need to worry about
the country getting attacked anymore!

235
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,391
Haruna!

236
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,354
Haruna...

237
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,278
Do it.

238
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,739
You want to take revenge
with your own hands, right?

239
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,783
I'll do the same if I were you.

240
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,467
I am...not like you!

241
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,149
Haruna...

242
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,341
Kikunojou, please forgive me.

243
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,093
Princess Haruna.

244
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,929
Here, Kikunojou could look over
the Land of Green.

245
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:02,058
I'm sure that Kikunojou
will watch over everyone forever.

246
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,771
Well, Lady Haruna,
we are leaving now.

247
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,526
Thank you, Naruto, Choji,
and Hinata.

248
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,488
Shizune, I'd like to ask a special favor.

249
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,657
What is it, Princess Haruna?

250
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:22,704
My role is to take over my father's will
to protect the peace of Land of Green.

251
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,124
In order to do that, I want to borrow
some help from the Leaf Village.

252
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,585
Our help?
Yes.

253
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,004
I want you to lend me Naruto.

254
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,463
Huh?!

255
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,550
Please, Naruto.

256
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,968
Princess Haruna.

257
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,140
I want you to help me
with the revival of the Land of Green.

258
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,984
I...I...

259
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,407
I'm sorry,
but I can't really do that.

260
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,663
I need to go back to my friends.

261
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,750
And I need to do more training
and become much stronger.

262
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,085
There are things that I must do.

263
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,547
It's all for my precious friends!

264
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,843
Then I can't take you away
from them...

265
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:23,514
Naruto, I'll promise that I will do
my best to keep my father's wishes

266
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:29,520
and strive for a peaceful country
where no one will be sacrificed.

267
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,900
Yeah!
It's a promise!

268
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,201
Thank you! Naruto!

269
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,869
Good-bye! Everybody!

270
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,913
We'll come back someday!

271
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,039
Bye!

272
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,332
See ya!

273
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:16,192
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

274
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,157
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

275
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,589
Yellow Moon.

276
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:45,430
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

277
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:50,768
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

278
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:57,608
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

279
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:04,657
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

280
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:11,205
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

281
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:17,837
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

282
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:24,719
A magical chord change, in a restless city

283
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:31,726
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

284
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,108
No! He's looking over here!

285
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,028
Of course, he'll look!
Stop complaining and attack him!

286
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,489
No, no, it's impossible! He just moved
right now! He moved, Naruto!

287
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,949
Of course, he'll move!
Hey, approach him more!

288
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,160
No, no, no. This is my limit.

289
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,204
Come on, just give him
a one good hit!

290
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,830
No, the enemy is that thing you know?

291
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,957
A monster, a monster!

292
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,877
This wouldn't be a mission!

293
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time:
"Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!"
