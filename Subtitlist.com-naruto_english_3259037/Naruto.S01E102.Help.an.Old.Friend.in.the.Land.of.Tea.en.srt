1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,887
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,224
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,320
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,616
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,787
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:43,878
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:50,634
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

15
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,782
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,755
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,977
We're almost at
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,896
Is everybody here?

22
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,481
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

23
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,486
Big Brother Omasa, we're missing one!

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,947
What? Who is it?!

25
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,742
It's Idate! Morino Idate!

26
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,204
Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!

27
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,957
What should we do? Shall we wait?

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,333
We have no choice...

29
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,877
What the...?!

30
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,045
Who is it?!

31
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,842
You people are from the Wasabi Family
of the Land of Tea, correct?

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,135
Who are you!

33
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,308
You should know your place.

34
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:24,603
Hooligans like you people
are no match for a Shinobi!

35
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,039
Please don't worry.
I won't take your lives.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,166
If you've learned from this,

37
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,420
you should give up the race
at Todoroki Great Shrine.

38
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,051
Blast it!

39
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,181
I have to at least deliver this letter
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,749
OK! Mission! Mission!
I'm so eager to do it!

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,586
But Kakashi Sensei is not here.

42
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,048
Is he late as usual?

43
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,675
No, Kakashi will not be coming.

44
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,511
It's Old Lady Tsunade!

45
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,971
Don't call me an old lady!

46
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,601
Excuse me... Lady Hokage...

47
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,354
What do you mean by
Kakashi Sensei will not be coming?

48
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,148
As you three already know,

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,735
most of the Jonin including Kakashi
are on different missions.

50
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,573
This time, the three of you will have
to execute the mission by yourselves.

51
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:04,036
This is a B-rank mission,
escorting an important figure!

52
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,997
Escorting an important figure...

53
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,041
Of course, depending on the situation,

54
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,460
the mission has the possibility
of becoming an A-rank.

55
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,923
And, who are we protecting?

56
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:20,177
Don't know...
What do you mean "don't know"?!

57
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,304
In the neighboring nation
of the Land of Tea,

58
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,390
they have a Dedication Ceremony
at the Todoroki Great Shrine

59
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,975
once every four years.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,102
We've received a request
to escort the runner

61
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,188
who will be participating in
the race that will be held there.

62
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,316
But an assailant from the opponent's side

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,820
attacked the messengers
before they arrived here.

64
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,614
Assailant?

65
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:44,076
Excuse me, but I still don't
quite understand the mission.

66
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:49,039
Well, you should get the details
directly from Boss Jirocho.

67
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:54,294
Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah!
The boss from that time!

68
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,422
That's it.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,465
Now that you three understand,
depart immediately!

70
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,510
Get to the Land of Tea by today.
Snap to it!

71
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,761
– Yes!
– All right.

72
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,014
Okay! Roger that!

73
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,392
I'm counting on you.

74
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,983
Mission! Help an Old Friend
in the Land of Tea

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,076
Hey Sakura, aren't you hungry?

76
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,453
Well, a little bit...

77
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,662
Then it's decided!

78
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,751
And perfect timing!
There's a teahouse right over there!

79
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,918
Hey, Naruto.

80
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,179
You're here...?

81
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,682
Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.

82
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,102
I had you go through all that trouble,

83
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,355
but Jirocho of the Wasabi
does not know when to give up.

84
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,901
Is he still trying to take part
in the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?

85
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,527
That's right.

86
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,407
And there's new information
that they have also hired Shinobi.

87
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,284
I see...

88
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,081
Then next time, let's beat them
to a pulp at the race...

89
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
Welcome!

90
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,172
Ma'am, I'll have sweet bean soup.

91
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,049
Then I'll have dumplings.

92
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,258
How about you, Sasuke?

93
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,927
Jelly...

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,387
All right, please wait for a moment.

95
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,896
Ninja from the Leaf...

96
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,856
I'm gonna work so hard!

97
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,318
Naruto, don't take unnecessary action
by yourself.

98
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,153
Oh, okay.

99
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,365
Having sweet bean soup
when it's so nice outside.

100
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,700
The Ninja profession sure is carefree!

101
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,577
What did you say?

102
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,165
Things must really be peaceful
for the Leaf Village.

103
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,084
Such a dense-looking bunch of guys...

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,795
What?!

105
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,465
Hey! I didn't know there was
such a cutie here.

106
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,467
I take back that previous comment!

107
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,427
Ah...pardon me.

108
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,971
I'm Idate Morino.

109
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,640
What's your name, young lady?

110
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,101
Don't you talk to Sakura
in such a familiar tone!

111
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,604
Sakura... That's a good name.

112
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,316
Hey, even a chance meeting is due
to karma from a previous life.

113
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,610
Why don't we talk about our future?

114
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,823
Huh? Talk about...the future?

115
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:32,995
I'm talking about you quitting
the Ninja life and becoming my bride...

116
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,498
Hey you! How dare you
hit on her all of a sudden!

117
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,167
Don't be silly!

118
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,752
Just joking.

119
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,546
But hey, you fool!

120
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,175
Idate here hates Ninja!

121
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,302
If you wander around
the Land of Tea anymore,

122
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,636
there'll be a price to pay!

123
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,472
That's amusing! Bring it on!

124
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,395
Hey, Naruto!

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,649
Ridiculous! We don't have time
to waste on a hooligan.

126
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,443
Be quiet, Sasuke!

127
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,237
I'm not going to forgive a guy
who makes fun of Shinobi!

128
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,448
I'm going to punish this guy...

129
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,574
Huh?

130
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,201
He's gone...

131
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,912
Impossible! I didn't even notice...

132
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,625
Where did that guy run away to?!

133
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,710
Here, thank you for waiting.

134
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,588
Dang it!

135
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,049
Thank you for your patronage.

136
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,052
What? Two bills?

137
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,553
This is...?

138
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,849
Oh, that kid who was here left,
saying that you guys would pay.

139
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,269
That guy! How dare he make fools of us!

140
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,024
The sound of footsteps is far off...
He has considerable speed!

141
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,109
He made us look like idiots!

142
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,487
I can't stay quiet. We have to chase him!

143
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,451
Missus, thank you very much.
I'll leave the money here.

144
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,119
Thanks!

145
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,748
All the customers today
seem to be in such a hurry.

146
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,087
He has incredible speed.
He must have trained very hard.

147
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,171
Who is he?

148
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,633
Doesn't matter, we're definitely
going to catch up to him!

149
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,638
Stupid Ninja!

150
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,056
There's no way they can catch up to me!

151
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,321
Owww!

152
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,909
Darn it... Swift Runner Idate
makes a mistake of a lifetime!

153
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,290
Serves you right!

154
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,213
You have some nerve,
trying to run away from us.

155
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,717
I'm so sorry!

156
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,594
Huh?
I'm sorry...

157
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:59,683
I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss,
then you guys showed up.

158
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,518
So I did that...

159
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,814
You kinda feel sorry
after hearing his story.

160
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,817
Then you should have said that
from the start!

161
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,569
Ow! Huh...?

162
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,323
What's this?
Don't touch it!

163
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,536
This is mine!

164
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,998
Wh-What the...?!

165
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,459
On your mark.

166
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,046
Get set...
Go!

167
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,340
Weights?

168
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,801
Try to catch me now, you idiots!

169
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,845
Hey! He escaped again!

170
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,764
That guy!

171
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,224
He simply doesn't get it!

172
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,271
Is he for real?

173
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,689
What a speed...!

174
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,111
No way! Even we can't catch up to him...?

175
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,619
That's it. We don't have a chance
of catching up.

176
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:05,082
Dang it! He'll get it
when I see him next time!

177
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,882
All of you, thanks for coming.

178
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,094
Begging your pardon! Begging your pardon!

179
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,723
I was born and raised
in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.

180
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,059
I was bathed in birth water
at "Ichiraku Ramen."

181
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,436
My given name is Naruto
and the surname is Uzumaki.

182
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,064
People call me...
Loser!

183
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,317
Loser...? Nah, not that!

184
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,779
You're funny as usual.

185
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,241
Boss Jirocho,
you're looking good yourself.

186
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,034
Hey, Naruto!

187
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:46,248
That's okay. A boy should be this spunky.

188
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,043
The greetings seem to be done,
so I'll get to the main topic.

189
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,964
The Fifth Hokage told us to get
the details of this mission from you.

190
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,217
Yes, in fact...

191
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,975
Do you know of the Dedication Ceremony
at the Todoroki Great Shrine?

192
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,103
To...Todo...what?

193
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,021
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

194
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,651
The legend goes...

195
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,991
A long time ago,
in order to subdue a storm,

196
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,619
Ryuko's Jewels were dedicated
to the Todoroki Great Shrine

197
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,622
and the storm subsided.

198
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,502
It became a customary event
that happens once every four years.

199
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:38,049
At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels,
but several decades ago,

200
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,676
it became a festival in which
the first-place runner

201
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
became the man of the year.

202
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:49,269
In recent years, the festival has
taken on another face.

203
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,898
For ages now,
in this port town of Degarashi,

204
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,401
two families,
the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,

205
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,154
have controlled local operations
and policed the town.

206
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,032
It's embarrassing,

207
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,201
but conflict between the two families
has never ceased and

208
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,413
there have been numerous skirmishes
over territorial rights.

209
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,916
As the struggle intensified,

210
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,629
the town residents became entangled
and even got injured...

211
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,884
In order to put a stop to the conflict,
for the first time,

212
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,347
there was talk of some kind of mediation
in the presence of the lord.

213
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,851
And it was agreed that the power holder
of the town

214
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,229
would be determined in a contest
rather than through brawls.

215
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,524
So that contest is...

216
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,026
It is the Todoroki Great Shrine
Dedication Ceremony

217
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,779
that is held every four years.

218
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,785
Four years ago, the Wagarashi
easily won by hiring a Shinobi,

219
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,247
and we have learned that
they've hired a Shinobi again this year.

220
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,374
In order to counteract that,

221
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,711
we sent messengers to
the Hidden Leaf Village with a request,

222
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,508
but they were ambushed and attacked.

223
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,518
I beg you guys!

224
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,396
Please lend us your power.

225
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:19,025
We cannot afford to lose this race
to the Wagarashi Family!

226
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,988
Leave it to me!

227
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,490
And, who do you want us to escort?

228
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,326
Oh, so you'll take this job?

229
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,707
Did you call for me, Boss?

230
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,719
Oh, you guys know each other?
Then that makes the story fast.

231
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,681
That might not actually be the case...

232
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,646
Boss Jirocho is an important person!

233
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,817
By rights, he shouldn't bow
his head to Ninja like you!

234
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:06,573
Even if he did bow his head,
I'd flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.

235
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,657
Oh yeah?!

236
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:12,871
As if I'd go with some guy who came
from who-knows-where!

237
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,165
"Some guy from who-knows-where"?!

238
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,084
I am the brilliant Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki,

239
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,295
who will eventually inherit
the name of Hokage!

240
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,631
Hah! Hokage is no big deal!

241
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,592
Hah! The boss of hooligans
is even less of a big deal!

242
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,720
You idiot! Boss Jirocho is
a very honorable person!

243
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,097
The Hokage is a great Shinobi

244
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,392
who puts his life on the line
to protect the village!

245
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:38,021
Boss Jirocho is a very,
very, very honorable person

246
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,440
who always puts his life
on the line to protect the town!

247
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,819
Hokage is more, more, more incredible!

248
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,961
Even though it's a tourist resort,
everything seems so expensive.

249
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,589
Sorry about that.
It sure is expensive, isn't it?

250
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,924
Oh no, I didn't mean...

251
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,968
We actually don't want to sell
at this kind of price,

252
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,055
but after the Wagarashi family
came into power...

253
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,433
P-Please forgive me!
How dare you?!

254
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,228
Do you know who you have
to thank to do business?

255
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,939
Are you actually thinking about turning
against the Wagarashi Family?

256
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,193
N-Not at all. But I have to get paid...

257
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,987
You're slow to understand.

258
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,656
– Hey!
– Yes, sir!

259
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,866
P-Please stop!

260
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,161
Huh! First of all, we'll destroy you...

261
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,832
Wh-Who are you?!

262
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,835
Get out of here before you get hurt!

263
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,670
– What?!
– What?!

264
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,046
Please run away!

265
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,715
These people are from the Wagarashi...

266
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,049
It'll be fine.

267
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,926
– You punk!
– Wise guy!

268
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,934
We'll let you go for today!

269
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,520
If you've learned your lesson,
never defy us again, kid!

270
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,316
Or you'll pay when we see you next time!

271
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,698
– Y-You won't get away with this!
– Y-You won't get away with this!

272
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,450
Young man...

273
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,661
Thank you very much.

274
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,038
What a refreshing feeling!

275
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,209
We definitely need Boss Jirocho's
Wasabi Family to win the upcoming race.

276
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,130
Sasuke...
Yeah...

277
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,643
Boss...

278
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,480
Of all people,
did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?

279
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,567
Don't sulk like that, Idate.

280
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,444
I'm not sulking.

281
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,780
It's just that...

282
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,364
Idate...

283
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,659
I believe in you more than anybody else.

284
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,412
The rest depends on you.

285
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,291
Why don't you believe in people a little?

286
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,092
Idate...

287
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,595
please run for this town.

288
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,056
I beg you!

289
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,724
Boss...

290
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,477
Okay.

291
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,854
Even in exchange for my life...

292
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,577
Wow, I didn't think it was going
to be this big!

293
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,330
But what kind of race is it?

294
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,543
I'll explain the course so
a dummy like you can understand.

295
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,921
The starting point is Degarashi Port.

296
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,466
After the start, you head for
Modoroki Shrine which is the midway point.

297
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,760
This is Modoroki Shrine...?

298
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,471
Yes... It seems the fastest way
to get to Modoroki Shrine

299
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,391
is to use a boat from here.

300
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,103
Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewels
from Modoroki Shrine and

301
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:09,023
dedicate that jewel at the
Todoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island.

302
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,068
That's the only rule for the race.

303
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,781
So shortcuts, obstructions,
and secret maneuvers are all allowed.

304
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,660
So hiring a Ninja is not
a violation of the rule either.

305
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,122
Who are the Ninja that
the other side hired?

306
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,041
They're hiding somewhere
and checking the situation.

307
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,626
Don't be careless, Naruto!

308
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,295
R-Right!

309
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,382
You guys can just relax and watch.
Don't follow me around!

310
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,717
What?!

311
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm saying I don't want an impediment.

312
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,220
You!

313
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,180
Calm down. Let's join forces here.

314
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,058
– Not with a guy like this!
– Not with a guy like this!

315
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,271
They seem to strangely be
in harmony, these two.

316
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,939
All right, everybody!

317
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,734
The Todoroki Great Shrine Race
will start soon!

318
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,821
Wasabi Family's runner, Idate Morino!

319
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,162
Idate...Morino?

320
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,249
Wagarashi Family's runner,
Fukusuke Hikyakuya!

321
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,841
On your mark!

322
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,324
Start!

323
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,286
All right! We're going too!

324
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,871
Wh-What the...?!

325
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,541
Is he running away?!

326
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,210
Where are you going, Idate?!

327
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,545
Hey, wait!

328
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,173
Wh-What is he doing...?

329
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,097
Wait!

330
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,103
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

331
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,941
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

332
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,862
On your still shoulder

333
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,534
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

334
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:30,415
The city lights are like pieces of stars

335
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,086
That hold us together

336
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,882
"Each one of us

337
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,554
glows differently,"

338
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,851
you say laughingly

339
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,646
but you look most dazzling

340
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,067
Like a comet,

341
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:04,240
like the rainbow after the storm

342
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,911
You bring light

343
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,372
into my heart

344
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

345
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:22,508
can be the answer

346
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,888
Let's promise

347
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,266
we won't cheat

348
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,942
What the heck is he thinking?! That idiot!

349
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,112
So fast. He's moving at
an incredible speed.

350
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,990
Darn it! The opponent's already
far out at sea!

351
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,075
This is bad!

352
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,118
If the distance between them gets
any greater, it'll be impossible to win!

353
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,495
That idiot!

354
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,913
– Kick it up a notch, Sakura!
– Right!

355
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,917
We're gonna bring him back at all cost
and make up the difference!

356
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:01,297
Next time: "The Race is On!
Trouble on the High Seas!"

357
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,049
Don't miss it!
