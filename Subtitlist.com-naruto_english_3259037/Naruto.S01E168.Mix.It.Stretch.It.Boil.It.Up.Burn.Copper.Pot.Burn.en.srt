1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,361
There was something beyond
that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,762
It's been a while since
I've eaten Ichiraku ramen!

16
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,098
Lately I've been away
from home on missions.

17
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,435
The bowl of ramen after
a mission...

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,356
it spreads to every muscle of the body
and becomes energy for tomorrow.

19
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,775
If you eat ramen
it drives fatigue away.

20
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,568
Ramen!

21
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,904
Ramen!

22
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,948
Ramen!

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,866
Ramen!

24
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,124
Temporarily closed...?

25
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,585
No, it can't be...

26
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:14,426
I endured all the tough missions,
looking forward to Ichiraku ramen...

27
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,096
I can smell ramen!
What?

28
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,809
You're right!

29
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,896
Without a doubt...
Ramen is being made in there!

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,649
Ramen!

31
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,904
Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up!
Burn Copper Pot Burn!

32
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,662
This smell...

33
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,247
It's the smell of a soup

34
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,541
that's never been on
the Ichiraku menu before.

35
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:50,212
Then... It's temporarily closed
to develop a new menu?

36
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,258
Who's there?!

37
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,683
A large helping of miso char siu ramen!
With an egg please.

38
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,358
I see...
You were looking forward to
my ramen that much.

39
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,402
Sorry about that.

40
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,863
It's okay to develop a new menu,

41
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,741
but I wish you'd do it
after the shop is closed.

42
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,790
Since you came all this way.
Give this a taste.

43
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,543
Could this be...

44
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,503
Ichiraku's new menu?!

45
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,716
Let's eat!
Wait a minute!

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,677
There are rules when you're eating
a new ramen for the first time...

47
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:39,970
Rule #1!

48
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,513
Before you do anything,

49
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,098
you must first have
a sip to taste the soup.

50
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,437
– Delicious!
– Delicious!

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,399
Next, you have to coat the noodles
in soup and eat.

52
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,490
Huh? It seems like something
is missing...

53
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,616
Let's get to the point.

54
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,494
The noodles are outdone
by the soup!

55
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,289
This well-seasoned, rich soup
greatly surpasses

56
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,584
any of Ichiraku's previous soups!

57
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,963
But! The noodles are
the same as always!

58
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,256
The balance is very bad.

59
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,759
I cannot give it a passing score!

60
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,512
That's what I thought...

61
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,683
Oh... Don't get so depressed...

62
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,727
Ayame, water! Water please!

63
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,730
Huh? Where's Ayame?

64
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,190
With ramen like this...

65
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,487
I'll never be able to get Ayame
back from the Ryonin.

66
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,075
Teuchi!

67
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,873
He's just overtired.

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,501
I had him drink an energy drink,
so after a little rest he'll recover.

69
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,964
But... I think he should take a break
from the shop for a while.

70
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,386
He's been using his arms
too much...

71
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,430
Look how swollen this is.

72
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,974
Come to think of it,
before he fell,

73
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,184
he said something about Ryonin
or whatever

74
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,729
did something to Ayame, I think...

75
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,815
Ayame is his daughter, right?

76
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,818
What's Ryonin?
I don't know...

77
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,989
Ryonin...
He's referring to the Ninja Chef.

78
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,241
Ninja Chef?

79
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,285
Do you know about them, Choji?

80
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,872
I've heard rumors about them...

81
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:37,337
One of the problems Shinobi's confront
on missions is the problem of meals!

82
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,299
Normally Food Pills were brought
with them,

83
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,176
but the main role of those
are to supply nutrients.

84
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,469
They have no taste.

85
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,889
If they could eat delicious food
while on missions,

86
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,267
would the success rate
of missions rise?

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,020
Based on that theory,
was born...

88
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,942
The Ninja Chef... Ryonin!

89
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,115
But what those Ninja Chef
have to do with Ayame?

90
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,618
They snatched her away...

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,121
What?! What are you talking about?!

92
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,082
Give us the details!

93
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,210
It was two weeks ago...

94
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,175
Ichiraku Ramen

95
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,094
Welcome!

96
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,637
The large serving,
here's your order!

97
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,102
A good job as always, Teuchi!

98
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,562
Hakkaku!

99
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,232
His name is Hakkaku,

100
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,193
long ago we trained at
the same ramen shop...

101
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,781
He told me he is a Ninja Chef,
a Ryonin, these days.

102
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,076
Actually... I have a favor to ask you.

103
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,080
What is it? If it's something I can do,
I'll cooperate.

104
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,334
The phantom recipe that
I heard you developed...

105
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,669
Please turn it over to me!

106
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,132
Ph-Phantom recipe?
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,136
To a chef, a recipe is
more precious than life!

108
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,429
I understand why
you want to hide it!

109
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,516
But... please! Give it to me!

110
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,602
I really had no clue.

111
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:20,524
But Hakkaku didn't believe me...

112
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,486
Ayame. Let's get to work
opening the shop...

113
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,948
What the... What's this tray?

114
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,245
Ayame!

115
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,205
I have your daughter.

116
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,709
If you want her back,
hand over the "phantom recipe!"

117
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,671
Damn that Hakkaku!

118
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,884
Why didn't you contact
the Hokage right away!

119
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,051
The Hokage could...

120
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,139
If I did that, I don't know what
would happen to Ayame.

121
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,185
And he also wrote this
in the letter...

122
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,813
That if I can serve them
something impressive,

123
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,483
he'll give up on the phantom recipe
and return my daughter safe.

124
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,695
But, you've got a way to win?

125
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,864
I don't know.

126
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,867
But a chef's challenged me
to a cooking match.

127
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,660
I have no choice but to do it.

128
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,372
So that's why you're developing
new ramen.

129
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,293
I was able to make the soup
exactly how I wanted to.

130
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:26,590
But...I just can't get the firm noodles
that go with the soup...

131
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,510
I can't get Ayame back like this!

132
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,307
The cooking match is tomorrow...
What am I going to do?

133
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,400
I can't imagine an Ichiraku
without Ayame.

134
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,240
Okay! Teuchi! We'll help you.

135
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,283
We'll make the best ramen...

136
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,993
And get Ayame back...

137
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,662
From the Ryonin!

138
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,043
You guys...

139
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,590
I'll teach you the basics
of making noodles.

140
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,512
Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.

141
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,056
If there are discrepancies,
there will be variations in
the taste of the noodles.

142
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,183
Next... Knead it.

143
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,603
If you don't put this properly
the noodles won't be firm.

144
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,188
Are you okay?

145
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,149
It's nothing. Don't worry about me.

146
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,530
And...stretch the noodles!

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,203
It's important for them to be
of a uniform thickness!

148
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,831
So there will be no differences
after boiling...

149
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,003
Try it.

150
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,383
It's easy to say it...

151
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,594
but to actually make the noodles
is not so easy.

152
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,974
It takes five years to become
an accomplished chef in his own right.

153
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,560
To do it by the match tomorrow
is completely...

154
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,312
When it comes down to it,

155
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,690
I'll have to give up this decrepit body
of mine to them.

156
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,238
Teuchi... You're not thinking about
when you lose, are you?

157
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,449
Th-That's...

158
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,993
Because if we are doing this,

159
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,120
we're doing it with the intention
of winning, believe it!

160
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,666
I absolutely don't forgive people
who hold a girl captive!

161
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,585
Cooking comes from the heart.

162
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,212
Technique and experience
aren't everything!

163
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,132
No problem...

164
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,636
We'll show them the real strength
of the Shinobi of Leaf Village!

165
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,937
Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!

166
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,568
The phantom recipe?

167
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,654
You can't tell by looking at me?

168
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,116
I see. How foolish...

169
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,785
Let me tell you,

170
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,413
ramen like the stuff I ate at
your shop the other day can't win.

171
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,082
Is Ayame okay?

172
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,666
Father!

173
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,585
Ayame!

174
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,756
The emotional reunion comes
after the match.

175
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,010
I have a favor to ask.
Let me have some helpers.

176
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:21,264
I don't think those kids are up
to the task, but...

177
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,892
Well... That's okay.

178
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,727
Well, let's start the cooking match!

179
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,904
Let's see if you can satisfy
all of us Ninja Chef!

180
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,156
There are so many of them...

181
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,368
We don't have time to stand around...
Let's begin!

182
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,247
The preparation for the soup
is done!

183
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,082
I'll prepare the ingredients
for the rest!

184
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,542
I'm leaving the noodles to you!

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,835
– Okay!
– Okay!

186
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:55,215
Listen. Our noodles determine
whether Ayame will return or not!

187
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,259
We cannot fail!

188
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,470
Seems like he's done a good job
with the soup...

189
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,014
The delicious aroma is
wafting over here.

190
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,350
Indeed, it's whetting my appetite.

191
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,768
The noodles are the problem!

192
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:11,064
Can those kids really make noodles that
will go with that soup?

193
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,817
First, mix the ingredients!

194
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,653
They're amateurs,
I thought so!

195
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,698
You can't make decent noodles
with that hand movement!

196
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,826
We practiced making noodles
all night!

197
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,413
But, we didn't make the noodles
we wanted to by morning...

198
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,834
Even so, we have to
make perfect noodles!

199
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,924
Hey hey. At least make us
something edible!

200
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,637
Quickly...
Uniformly...

201
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,139
Without discrepancies!

202
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,766
Next, knead it!

203
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,351
Hey, Sakura!

204
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,562
Look, it's Kakashi Sensei.

205
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,898
Don't play!

206
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,902
Sakura...

207
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:06,119
Oww! Sakura, you just can't control
your own crazy strength!

208
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,164
It's your fault for playing around
at a time like this!

209
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,128
This is...

210
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,342
This is...
the last of the ingredients.

211
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,970
No problem. This time, let us
show you we'll succeed!

212
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,016
Okay, I'm mixing.

213
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,645
Wait Choji! Leave this to me!
Naruto...

214
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,314
Hey, Sakura...
Huh?

215
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,442
We are Shinobi, right?

216
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,239
So then... Let's show them
the Ninja way to make noodles!

217
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,492
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

218
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,838
Rasengen! "Ichiraku" version!

219
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:06,012
Wh-What?! Mixing ingredients
with Chakra?!

220
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:14,771
No, that way he'll surely be able
to mix the ingredients uniformly!

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,482
And in micro units!

222
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,614
Sakura!
What?

223
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,076
Pervy Sage.

224
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,703
Naruto!

225
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,330
Cha!

226
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,423
Wh-What's this crazy strength...?!

227
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,384
If she does that,
the noodles will become super firm!

228
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,266
Okay, Sakura! Choji!

229
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,103
I, too...am a Shinobi of Leaf Village!

230
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,648
Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!

231
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,363
What?!

232
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,327
What outstanding noodles!

233
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,415
If those noodles are added to
Teuchi's soup, this match would...

234
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,296
W-We cannot lose!

235
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,090
It's for the future of the Ninja Chef!

236
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,885
Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!

237
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,095
Okay! Leave it to me!

238
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,555
Wait a minute!

239
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,935
When the ramen is done...

240
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,979
Who will you serve it to first?

241
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,482
Huh? Who...?

242
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,942
Th-That's right...
That's how it is!

243
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,444
That's how what is?

244
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,613
Among the chefs...

245
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,115
there's a cardinal rule
not to be forgotten.

246
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,828
The first guest to arrive is
the first guest served!

247
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,748
No matter how delicious
the food you make is...

248
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,085
if you break this cardinal rule,
you're disqualified as a chef!

249
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,006
True, if a guy who came later
were eating before me,

250
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,508
then it would seriously pisses me off.

251
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,803
There are 100 Ninja Chefs here...

252
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,430
They all showed up at about
the same time!

253
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:17,227
So you have to serve ramen
to 100 people at the same time!

254
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,978
You're four people...

255
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,732
Can you really serve at
the same time?

256
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,486
I said we're Ninja, didn't I?

257
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,987
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

258
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,742
What?!

259
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,628
Now! Lift them!

260
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,014
– Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
– Thanks for waiting. Here you go!

261
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,438
Th-The taste is the issue!
If you don't satisfy us, you lose!

262
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,868
Delicious!

263
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,829
– Delicious!
– Delicious!

264
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,207
I've never had ramen this delicious.

265
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,129
So then...
We win!

266
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,465
– We did it!
– We did it!

267
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,925
The truth is...

268
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,928
We Ninja Chefs are at
the end of our rope...

269
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,014
End of your rope?

270
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,016
What do you mean by that?

271
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:44,272
We endeavored to make
delicious meals to eat during missions...

272
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,317
We thought to make delicious food,
to fill your stomach...

273
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,943
that can be eaten anywhere...

274
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,866
But we pursued taste too far.

275
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,286
It was too delicious, people were
compelled to overeat.

276
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,704
And as a result...

277
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:09,422
Ninja gained weight,
and it interfered with their missions.

278
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,966
And some people are now saying,

279
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,886
"we don't need
the Ninja Chefs anymore."

280
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,554
– Oh...
– Oh...

281
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,599
For us Ninja Chefs
to continue,

282
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,894
we had to get our hands on
the "phantom" recipe out there

283
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,646
in the cooking world!

284
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,730
Recipe?

285
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,899
If we use this recipe,

286
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,694
we can improve the performance
of Shinobi without causing a burden.

287
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,113
There's such recipe...?

288
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,783
I hear, it's called
"the scum recipe."

289
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,535
– The scum recipe?!
– The scum recipe?!

290
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,038
We've gathered information
from everywhere...

291
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,164
As a result,

292
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:47,085
we learned that the scum recipe
was at "Ichiraku" which Teuchi run.

293
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,545
– What?!
– What?!

294
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,005
I-I don't know!

295
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,757
There's no reason something like that
should be at my shop!

296
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,384
There's someone who heard it!

297
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,930
I've got "the scum recipe"
at my shop, so...

298
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,517
Oh... Teuchi...?
Oh. I might have that.

299
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,477
Are you serious?!

300
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,563
I thought so!

301
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,524
To be precise...
It's the "scum removal recipe."

302
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,486
– Scum removal?
– Scum removal?

303
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,030
The trick to making delicious soup...

304
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,325
is how well you
remove the scum.

305
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,994
So I, too, studied a lot.

306
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:25,498
Eventually, I worked out a recipe
that can remove the scum effectively.

307
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,169
Usually it's called
"the scum recipe" for short...

308
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,172
I never thought that
this misunderstanding would arise.

309
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,717
That's a pretty big omission.

310
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,138
Geez. That's a stupid punch line...

311
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,016
We won the cooking match,

312
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,143
so keep your promise
and return Ayame!

313
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,021
That's right! Where is she?!

314
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,315
Father!

315
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,027
Aya...me?

316
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,492
Ayame...is that you?

317
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,161
Can't you tell by looking?

318
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,205
B-But Ayame is like...

319
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:16,007
The food they make is
so delicious, I overeat...

320
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,634
Did I gain that much weight?

321
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,469
Ayame!

322
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,058
Ichiraku's new menu?

323
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,311
The thing we made
at the cooking challenge?

324
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,856
No, a diet ramen
that's popular among girls.

325
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,274
Diet Ramen?

326
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,031
It's super popular!

327
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,494
Oh, come on in, Naruto.

328
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,163
You've regained
your former shape...

329
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,999
It's thanks to my father's
diet ramen!

330
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,251
Huh? Where's your father?

331
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,923
Well... While he was joining me
in eating the diet ramen...

332
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,549
Hey... Naruto.

333
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,973
That's a little too thin, believe it.

334
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,280
The wind blows, Ah...

335
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,742
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

336
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,620
What should be brought along?

337
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,249
Assemble them into a piece.

338
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,461
There is no second chance, never

339
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,463
How foolish it is to throw away

340
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,383
Acting so innocently, Ah...

341
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,427
The images.

342
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,183
It probably will not end

343
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,023
It probably will not end

344
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,194
Burn that love-filled heart,

345
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,448
Sail across a thousand dreams

346
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,325
Running freely

347
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,912
To take hold of the world in hand

348
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,124
The clouds scatter

349
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,210
The sun sets yet again

350
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:22,842
The solo parade begins to move.

351
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,429
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

352
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,849
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

353
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,442
Does anyone have anything
to ask about this mission?

354
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,526
I've got a question!

355
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,195
Why should I have to go on
a mission with this group?

356
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,489
Okay, let's move on.
Everyone ready?

357
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,616
Hey, I've got a question, believe it!

358
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,700
As for the mission details,

359
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,410
we're to eliminate the Demon of the Ocean
in the Land of Oceans.

360
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,953
You guys are going to get
fired up for me

361
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,205
since you came to serve under me!

362
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,040
Just a minute.
Hey, listen to me!

363
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,374
Now, let's get going!

364
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,752
Stop complaining and
just come with me!

365
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,129
Listen to me, I say.
Listen! Listen! Listen!

366
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,715
Next time:
"Remembrance: The Lost Page"
