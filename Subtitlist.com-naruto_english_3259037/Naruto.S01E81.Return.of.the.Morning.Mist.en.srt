1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,554
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,728
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,818
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,945
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road filled
with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,579
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,458
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,669
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:47,173
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,010
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,903
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,573
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,701
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,747
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,755
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,782
Huh? Uh... Excuse me...

23
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,474
Return of the Morning Mist

24
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,908
My mother and my father...
They didn't have to die.

25
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,830
Because I didn't have strength,
the whole clan was destroyed.

26
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,875
Everyone was killed...

27
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,596
Darn it...

28
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,020
Morning training is over!

29
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,366
Once I've eaten breakfast

30
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,952
I'll get back to rigorous training!

31
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,422
Old man...

32
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,424
Konohamaru...

33
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,387
Yo! Konohomaru.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,226
Naruto.

35
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,772
Have you already resumed
studies at the academy?

36
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,191
N-No, not yet.

37
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,776
The school buildings are damaged,
so we're all repairing them.

38
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,486
Is that so?

39
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,820
How about you, Naruto?
You're already training?

40
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,076
Sort of.

41
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,119
Wh-What?

42
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,045
What is it?

43
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,838
N-No, it's nothing...

44
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,884
– Hey um...!
– Hey um...!

45
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,637
So what is it...?

46
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,140
You too, Naruto, what is it?

47
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,434
Nothing...really...

48
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,190
-I don't feel lonely.
-Huh?

49
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,568
There's no time to be feeling lonely.

50
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:42,157
Everyone is working really hard
to rebuild the village right now.

51
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,160
Konohamaru...

52
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,289
Right now, I must work for
the village even just a little bit.

53
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,960
So Naruto,
you work hard at your training too.

54
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,505
If you don't,
I'll become Hokage before you.

55
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,090
Fool,

56
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,884
I will absolutely become Hokage.

57
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,680
Besides...you have to graduate
from the Academy first.

58
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,182
Oh, that's right...

59
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,438
Oh, here it is. Here, it's for you.

60
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,647
A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku...

61
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,858
Is it okay?

62
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,652
I already have one,

63
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,154
so I'm giving one to you.

64
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,489
Thank you, Naruto.

65
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,158
Oh! Konohamaru.

66
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,951
Good morning.

67
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm going to go.

68
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,997
We'll work hard again today.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,331
– Yep!
– Yep!

70
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,834
Today we're fixing the blackboards.

71
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,961
I brought paint.

72
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,089
Well! Once I've eaten ramen at Ichiraku,

73
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,050
I'll continue training.

74
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,065
This is it.

75
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,527
Th-This is...

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,700
A lot of time has passed since the death.

77
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,162
It's probably before
the Chunin Exam began.

78
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,791
I see, so that's it...

79
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,837
That Orochimaru!

80
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,635
After the murder of Lord Kazekage,

81
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,889
Orochimaru... or someone like
Kabuto played Kazekage...

82
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,059
How thoughtless we were...

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,110
That darn Sarutobi...

84
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,696
Well, it's not that easy.

85
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,532
The one who was your opponent
was the renowned Hokage,

86
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,452
deemed to be strongest
of all five great nations.

87
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,413
However...you've done well.

88
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,415
Two out of the five Kages...

89
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,042
Stop...

90
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:02,422
Stop giving me words of sympathy.

91
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,008
I will kill you!

92
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,723
Of course, I didn't mean to...

93
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,560
It's true that we didn't succeed
in bringing the village down...

94
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,398
On the other hand,
another objective of this plan,

95
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,275
Sasuke Uchiha...

96
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,028
Your leash is now on him.

97
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:32,327
In exchange for these
arms and all of my Jutsu...

98
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,584
If we could have gotten our hands on
that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,

99
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,711
it wouldn't have been a problem.

100
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,299
However that's a dream
that can no longer come true.

101
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,677
He is stronger than I am.

102
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,725
That is why...

103
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,146
I pulled myself out from
that organization...

104
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
Kakashi, huh?

105
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,079
What does he want?

106
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,583
Breakfast, breakfast!

107
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,753
Wait for me, my ramen.

108
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,844
Do you already know his whereabouts?

109
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,930
Yes.

110
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,308
In that case, it will be easy...

111
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,435
Let's go.

112
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,065
Here it comes, here it comes.

113
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,360
Oh goodie, it's just like I thought.

114
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,528
Hidden Leaf Village...

115
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,157
has a high average score.

116
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,869
You're still doing such
a ridiculous thing?

117
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,372
Well yes, this is my research.

118
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,793
Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?

119
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,256
I wonder what you advisers want from me.

120
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,758
Surely, you know...

121
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,427
without our telling you, don't you?

122
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,438
You don't have to make such scary faces.

123
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,775
I heard that the talks with Sand Village
have been settled without problems.

124
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,361
The Hidden Village in
the Sand announced that

125
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,906
everything was Orochimaru's handiwork.

126
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,409
In addition,

127
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,453
at the moment of their complete
surrender to us, the Leaf Village,

128
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,415
that wasn't a very
important issue any more.

129
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,502
Leaf Village has no choice but to
accept their surrender and proposition

130
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,963
in order to restore national power.

131
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,548
However,

132
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,802
the current strength of Leaf Village
has dropped drastically.

133
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,514
Under these conditions, our top priority

134
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,726
must be to prepare for
any unpredicted crisis.

135
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,562
We don't know when any
of the neighboring nations

136
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,023
will come out in a bold move.

137
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,067
Therefore, we've decided that until
the village gets its strength back,

138
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,362
we should assemble the top
few men from each troop,

139
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:16,950
and form an emergency executive
committee to handle this.

140
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,329
But first...

141
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,585
we need a strong, trustworthy leader.

142
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,340
You can find the seeds of trouble
rolling around everywhere these days.

143
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,050
It's not just Orochimaru.

144
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,429
You didn't have to go through
the trouble of informing me that.

145
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,891
Well... I'll continue gathering materials.

146
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,769
I'm going to tell you the basic plan.

147
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,397
We need the Fifth Hokage right away.

148
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,233
And yesterday at an emergency meeting

149
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,819
with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,

150
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,863
we decided it would be you, Jiraiya.

151
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,744
I'm sorry, it's not my nature.

152
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,371
It has been decided.

153
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,289
Besides, if a Shinobi like you,

154
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,459
renowned as a Sannin, is not... then who is?

155
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,464
If you want a Sannin,
there is one more left...

156
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,718
That Tsunade.

157
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,850
Certainly that child probably
has that capability, but...

158
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,728
However, no one knows where she is.

159
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,814
I'll find and bring her back.

160
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,233
If I do that there's no problem, right?

161
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,401
But...

162
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,903
A wise one like Tsunade

163
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,906
is meant to be Hokage more than I,
with no motivation.

164
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,910
What do you want to do?

165
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,457
All right.
We'll give it urgent consideration.

166
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,085
However, we'll have three members
from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you

167
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,962
as the search unit for Tsunade.

168
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,590
Don't worry, I won't escape from this.

169
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,843
The guards are not necessary.

170
00:11:58,969 --> 00:11:59,970
However...

171
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,684
There is one guy that I want
to take with me on my trip.

172
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,980
I've found an interesting egg...

173
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:14,025
What? That is absolutely strange.

174
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,279
Sorry, but if you don't have a ticket,
there's no ramen.

175
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,199
No, wait a minute!
I absolutely had one more.

176
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,325
Huh?

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,953
The one that I gave Konohamaru,
was it the last?

178
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,290
Welcome!

179
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,422
Hey, my ramen!

180
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,634
"Racy Violence"

181
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,180
Yo, you two!

182
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,099
You seem to be getting along well.

183
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,896
Fool, Anko asked me to buy rice dumplings.
That's all.

184
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,648
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
While I'm here to buy offerings,

186
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,446
I've made plans to meet here...

187
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,157
with Sasuke.

188
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,578
Huh, it's rare that you wait for people.

189
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,706
Is the offering to Obito?

190
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,041
Obito?

191
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,418
Well...that's about right.

192
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,638
Kakashi, it's strange
for you to be here first.

193
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,182
Well... once in a while.

194
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,026
I don't do natto (fermented
beans) and sweet things.

195
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,694
Oh... Is that so?

196
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,456
What?!

197
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,085
This is absolutely positively strange!

198
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,436
You guys aren't from the village...

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,230
Why in the world did you come?

200
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,900
I haven't seen you for
a while Asuma, Kurenai.

201
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,319
If you know about us,

202
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,947
are you former Leaf Shinobi?

203
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,040
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

204
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,750
Y-You are?!

205
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,888
Humph, without a doubt...

206
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,850
Itachi...

207
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,644
Uchiha.

208
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,483
You are acquaintances of Itachi?

209
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,819
If so...

210
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,114
I'll introduce myself as well.

211
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,286
I'm Kisame Hoshigaki.

212
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,455
Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.

213
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,876
Never mind later,

214
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm going to beat you now!

215
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,505
Itachi...

216
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,134
It seems you're pretty
unpopular in the village too.

217
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,428
I know you, too.

218
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,055
Kisame Hoshigake,

219
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,598
originally a Shinobi of
Hidden Village in the Mist.

220
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,602
Suspected of national covert
activities and of killing a feudal lord,

221
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,606
a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,
on the wanted list in all nations.

222
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,903
You're a major S-rank criminal
listed in the Bingo Book.

223
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,824
Itachi, you have some nerve

224
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,119
coming back to this village

225
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,829
after causing that awful incident.

226
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,082
Asuma... Kurenai...

227
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,834
Don't interfere with me.

228
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,296
I don't intend to kill you.

229
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,009
That's not a line for you,
who killed your comrades.

230
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,887
I know there's no way you'd come here

231
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,308
without any clear purpose in
those suspicious appearance.

232
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,811
What are you after?

233
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,278
This guy is pretty annoying.
Should we kill him?

234
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,448
It doesn't look like we are able to
leave the village so smoothly...

235
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,870
But don't overdo it,
your techniques tend to stand out.

236
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,832
They're done for then.

237
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,916
This is...

238
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,210
Genjutsu.

239
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,556
Pressing down with the tip of
his sword... What strength.

240
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,312
My large sword, Shark Skin...

241
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,032
doesn't cut, but lops it off!

242
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,124
Kurenai... You're late.

243
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,400
With this...

244
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:31,903
it's over!

245
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,329
Genjutsu of that level doesn't work on me.

246
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,582
This is...Genjutsu Reversal?

247
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,896
Kurenai!

248
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,732
There's no time to look away.

249
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,486
That's what's expected from you,
Kurenai. But...

250
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,366
"But" this is as far as it goes...

251
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,451
for you.

252
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,044
What?!

253
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,469
Water Style!

254
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,310
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!

255
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,900
The same Jutsu as me?!

256
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,695
Why have you shown up too?

257
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,908
Well...I asked you to
take care of them earlier.

258
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,702
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.

259
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,996
Shadow clones.

260
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,958
Kakashi... Hatake.

261
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,505
Cripes... So much fuss for nothing.

262
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,092
I...

263
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,261
I put it under my headband

264
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:25,308
in order not to drop the important
ticket during morning training.

265
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,854
Okay, that's fine...

266
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,731
Eat well and do your best.

267
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
Hmm?

268
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,778
You're going to do it again after this,
right? Training?

269
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,533
Of course! I'm full of motivation.

270
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,952
Good! Here you go.

271
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,666
Another serving for free! Go for it!

272
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,960
Thank you, sir!

273
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,380
Welcome.

274
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,632
Just like I heard... I had
to come and see it.

275
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,011
It seems that you really
are just eating ramen.

276
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,973
Oh, Pervy Sage!

277
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,398
A cycle of hardship, right?

278
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:18,361
Inside, we were crying, right?

279
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:24,784
But the one thing we won't give up

280
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

281
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,415
It's a secondary role,

282
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,796
a role in the shadows

283
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

284
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,557
let us stay centered, let us stay true

285
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,311
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

286
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:57,025
Over and over, we kept coming back up

287
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:01,738
Over and over,

288
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,160
we believed and dreamed

289
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,415
Over and over, we've seen fools

290
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:17,962
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

291
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,216
Now, it's our turn...

292
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,431
Let us bask in our dreams

293
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,400
Itachi Uchiha...

294
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,944
who became a leader of
Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen

295
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,073
and who destroyed the Uchiha
clan single-handedly.

296
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,077
I don't know why he has suddenly
appeared after all this time...

297
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,664
But I don't think we will
allow him to leave so easily.

298
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,461
What is your purpose?!

299
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,007
Next time: "Sharingan vs. Sharingan!"
