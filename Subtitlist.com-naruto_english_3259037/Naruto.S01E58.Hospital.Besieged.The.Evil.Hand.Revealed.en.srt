1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,797
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:15,182
Even if you get lost, let's start walking

4
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,937
One more time

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

6
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,174
and someday,

12
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

13
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes,

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,979
precious things are never in shape

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:08,986
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

16
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,365
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

17
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

19
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,711
let's start walking

20
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,880
One more time

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,598
Hey! Open up!

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,478
Huh?
What's all this noise at this hour?

23
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,649
Idiots! I told you not to let
your eyes off him, didn't I?

24
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,283
Could Gaara have...?

25
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,160
Where on earth did he go?

26
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,670
I hope nothing bad happens, but...

27
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,134
Hospital Beseiged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!

28
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,916
Wow, he's sound asleep...
I wonder if he's dead?

29
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,274
If that's for Sasuke,
he's not back yet.

30
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,656
Ino...

31
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,370
I'm way ahead of you on
Sasuke information.

32
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,249
Missed your chance on that one,
eh, Billboard Brow?

33
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,503
No! This is for Lee!

34
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,255
Huh?

35
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,841
The one from before should
be wilted by now too...

36
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,512
Oh.

37
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,806
Lee! Stop it!

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,059
191...

39
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
Don't touch me!

40
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,606
I'm...not...done yet...

41
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,815
Here.

42
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,860
Thanks.

43
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,573
I hope Lee's better.
Yeah.

44
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,181
Huh?

45
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,308
What the...?

46
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:32,231
Oh man, it's all clogged up.
What a drag...

47
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,737
Yo!

48
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,739
You finally woke up, eh?

49
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,118
Where...am I?

50
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,411
In the hospital!

51
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,706
They told me that you've been
sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!

52
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,083
Three days...

53
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,920
Three days and three nights?!

54
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,047
W-What?

55
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,800
Shikamaru! When does
the final competition start?

56
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,053
T-Tomorrow.
What?!

57
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,681
Why didn't you wake me
up earlier!

58
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,685
I can't be just snoozing through
in a place like this!

59
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,853
And what about Pervy Sage?

60
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,771
Where's Pervy Sage?!

61
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,857
I've got to have him watch
over my training.

62
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,067
Huh? What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

63
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,694
I don't know what's got into you.

64
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,406
Huh? My clothes are missing!

65
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,366
Where are they?
Where, where?

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,453
– Sleeping away like you're in a coma,
– Gone!

67
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,204
– then running around out of control.
– Where're my clothes?!

68
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,582
Settle down a little!

69
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,086
You know what?
It isn't gonna make a difference

70
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,629
if you rush around
one day beforehand.

71
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,798
Resting is training, too, you know...

72
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,718
Huh? Hey...Naruto.

73
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,678
What in the world
is going on?

74
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,890
I'm...so...hungry...

75
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,143
Don't keep scaring me like that...

76
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,895
Oh yeah.

77
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,443
It's such a drag but...

78
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,196
I bought this fruit basket as
a get-well present for Choji.

79
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,156
But the doctor said he couldn't have it.

80
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,574
So let's eat it together.

81
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,911
Choji? Is he that sick?

82
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,080
No, no, don't be fooled.

83
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:15,918
He got sick from eating
too much BBQ.

84
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,254
That's just like him!

85
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:23,050
Yeah well, and neither of you are the type
to have female visitors.

86
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,134
So here...

87
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,554
Looks good.

88
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,475
W-What is it?

89
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,938
Since Choji can't have any,
let's eat in front of him.

90
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,941
What a drag this guy is!

91
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,443
Huh?

92
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,780
No one's here.

93
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,869
Out to lunch?

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,915
Oh well...

95
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,050
Okay!

96
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,802
Hmm?

97
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,332
Lee, I'm putting the
flowers here, okay?

98
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,931
I'm still hungry!

99
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,822
Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?

100
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,637
Oh yeah.

101
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,290
Why...save him?

102
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:47,254
He's an important subordinate
whom I care for.

103
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,360
My body...isn't moving.

104
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,070
You jerk!

105
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,825
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

106
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,204
Hey Naruto...

107
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:07,042
During Shadow Possession Jutsu,
it's moving me too! Okay?!

108
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,920
Sorry! Shikamaru.

109
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,720
What the hell were you
trying to do?

110
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,933
Choji, are you better?

111
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,851
Oh, Ino!

112
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,275
All right! The age of
the chubby has arrived!

113
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,916
What were you trying to do
to Bushy Brow here?!

114
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,878
I was trying to kill him.

115
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,088
What?!

116
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,675
How can he be so calm?

117
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:01,054
Especially when he is not able to
move with my Shadow Possession Jutsu...

118
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,850
Why'd you have to do something
like that?

119
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,769
You beat him in the match, right?

120
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,856
Do you have a personal grudge
against him or something?

121
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,316
I don't have anything like that.

122
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,780
I just wanted to kill him, that's it.

123
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,992
How can you say something
so selfish, you bastard?!

124
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,579
You...you had a lousy upbringing,
didn't you?

125
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,039
All you care about is yourself.

126
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,128
Or there's something weird about him.
It gives me the chills!

127
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,965
If he tries anything, it'll be too much
of a burden for me and Naruto...

128
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,427
What the heck should we do?

129
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,306
If you get in my way,
I'll kill you both too.

130
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,184
What?! Go ahead, if you can!

131
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,894
Hey Naruto, hold on!

132
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,148
Should I try to scare him with a bluff?

133
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,861
I know you're strong from seeing you
in the competition with him...

134
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,574
But...we can keep up with you.

135
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,870
We didn't show you our best skills
in the preliminaries.

136
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,581
And it's two against one!

137
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,666
You're the one who's at a disadvantage.

138
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,837
If you're smart, you'll do what
I tell you and just get lost.

139
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,383
I'll say it again...
if you get in my way...

140
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,885
I'll kill you.

141
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,845
Where the heck do you get off...?!

142
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,057
There's no way in hell
I'll let you do that!

143
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,851
I've been telling you
to back off, haven't I?

144
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,313
This guy has the strength of a monster.
You get it, don't you?

145
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:39,194
I have a real monster in me!
I'm not going to lose to this guy!

146
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,540
Huh?

147
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,793
I heard Naruto was here too,
so I came to see, but...

148
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,462
What a mess...

149
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,132
Well, I guess this means he's okay.

150
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,217
Huh?

151
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,891
What's worth making him mad,
you idiot!

152
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,315
A monster, huh...?

153
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,403
Me too, actually.

154
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:27,659
It's just like you said.
I had a terrible upbringing.

155
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,828
When I came into this world,

156
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,664
I took the life of the woman
some might call my mother.

157
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,500
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi...

158
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,253
my father brought his
Ninjutsu upon me,

159
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,630
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.

160
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,092
I was born a monster.

161
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,429
A Sand Spirit?

162
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,182
It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of
an old monk

163
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,811
from Village Hidden in the Sand
who was sealed inside the tea caldron.

164
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,441
It must be a type of
cacodemon possession Jutsu,

165
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,276
performed to a baby before it is born.

166
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,779
To go that far...
they must have been totally nuts.

167
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,329
Is it possible...that there could be
something inside him too?

168
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:20,587
What a thing for a parent to be doing!
Such a twisted kind of love.

169
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,547
Love?

170
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,550
Don't measure me by your standards.

171
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,762
Family, huh...

172
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:33,725
Let me tell you what kind of ties
I have to my family.

173
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,561
They're ties of hatred,
ties of murderous intent...

174
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,688
My family's just lumps of flesh.

175
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,109
Nourished with the life of my mother,

176
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,363
I was crafted as the
ultimate masterpiece of the village...

177
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,948
The Kazekage's child.

178
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,869
I was taught by my father
the innermost secrets of the Shinobi...

179
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,247
spoiled, over-protected,
and left on my own.

180
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,668
And I thought that was love...

181
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,507
Until that incident happened.

182
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,926
That incident...?!

183
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,182
What are you talking about?

184
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,106
Just what happened?!

185
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,113
In the six years since the time
when I was 6 years old...

186
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,574
My real father has tried to assassinate me
more times than I can count!

187
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,665
But I thought you just said that
your father spoiled you...

188
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,333
What's going on here?

189
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:51,010
Those who are too strong are
apt to become feared.

190
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,098
Born through the Jutsu,
my mind was unstable...

191
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,183
I guess the idiots in my village

192
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,478
finally realized that
I had emotional problems...

193
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,732
For my father, Kazekage,

194
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,317
at the same time I was
the ultimate weapon for the village,

195
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,237
I was also a dangerous,
fearsome presence.

196
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,951
It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure
as soon as I turned six.

197
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:20,415
And I was treated politely simply because
I was feared.

198
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,502
To them, now I'm just a relic of the past
that they want to see disappear.

199
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:30,341
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

200
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,595
When I asked myself that,
I couldn't find the answer.

201
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,476
But, as long as you're alive,
you need a reason...

202
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,770
If you don't have one,
it's just the same as being dead.

203
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,272
What's this guy saying?

204
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,944
I...can understand that...

205
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,865
He...is the same as me.

206
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,076
So this is the answer I came to...

207
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,748
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

208
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,794
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,

209
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,129
finally I became calm.

210
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:15,345
By killing assassins, I finally
comprehended the reason why I live...

211
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:20,517
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself...

212
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,853
And if I see that all other people
in this world exist

213
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,897
only to make me realize that,

214
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,358
there could be no world
more wonderful.

215
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,987
And as long as there are
others to kill

216
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,658
who can make me feel
this happiness to be alive,

217
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,119
I will never disappear.

218
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,580
W-What's this freak talking about...?

219
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,082
He's real gone!

220
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,751
I was also alone...

221
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,296
And suffered 'cause
I didn't know why I was alive...

222
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,259
But Iruka Sensei recognized me
for who I was...

223
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,595
and that was the first time
I realized why I lived...

224
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,476
But this guy...
this guy grew up alone.

225
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,689
And he ony feels alive
when he kills other people.

226
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,778
H-How can there be someone like this?

227
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:21,536
The worlds we live in
are too different...!

228
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:28,084
There's no way...
that I can beat a guy like this!

229
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,839
W-What's wrong, Naruto?

230
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:45,101
What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should
have stopped him from moving, but...

231
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,191
Naruto!

232
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,444
Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!

233
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,237
What a drag this guy is!

234
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,739
Naruto!

235
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,450
Now, let me feel it...!

236
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,912
Oh no!

237
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,371
Stop right there!

238
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,499
Tomorrow's the final round!

239
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,710
There's no need to rush like this!

240
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,922
Or do you just want to
stay here starting today?

241
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,258
Don't leave me alone!

242
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,595
I'm not bleeding, but
it hurts a lot right here.

243
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,061
What...am I?!

244
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:56,047
I will...kill you all without a fail.

245
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,840
Just wait.

246
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,400
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

247
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,778
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

248
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,281
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

249
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,576
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

250
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:32,041
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

251
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:38,214
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

252
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,382
Fight! Fight! Fight!

253
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,146
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

254
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,774

256

Four! Japanese people,

257
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:09,662
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

258
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:15,752
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

259
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,878
Fight! Fight! Fight!

260
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:23,509
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

261
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:29,515
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

262
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,601
Fight! Fight! Fight!

263
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:41,402
Hey! Konohamaru!
How could this be the ace route?!

264
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,695
I'm already late!

265
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,615
And you're making me later
by taking a longer route to get to the field!

266
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,326
The final competition
will start anytime now.

267
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,787
Darn it!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

268
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,123
Run, run, run, run!

269
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,753
Next time, "The Final Rounds:
Rush to the Battle Arena!"

270
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,465
I can't trust your "ace" route at all!
