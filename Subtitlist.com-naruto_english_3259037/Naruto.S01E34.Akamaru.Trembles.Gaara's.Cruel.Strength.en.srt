1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,388
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,809
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,486
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:33,743
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,496
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,836
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,797
Now

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,269
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,645
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,524
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:10,988
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,656
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,456
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:44,063
Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara's Cruel Strength!

20
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,243
That guy...?

21
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,036
Everyone hide!

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,746
No, lie low quick!

23
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,582
W-Where is that guy?

24
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,918
Naruto...

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,130
That fool, he finally woke up.

26
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,595
You are quite one of a kind.

27
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,182
Actually, you are getting on my nerves.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,567
Sakura!

29
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,027
– What?
– Y-Y-Your...!

30
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,947
Sakura...your hair!

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,157
Oh! This...?

32
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,454
I'm changing my image,
changing my image!

33
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,335
I like it better long but,

34
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,088
when I move around in
a forest like this,

35
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,048
it gets in the way if it's long.

36
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,344
By the way...

37
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,848
why are you guys here?!

38
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,519
Hah... It's such a pain
to explain it to you.

39
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,230
Everybody helped out.

40
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,565
Huh?

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,235
Sakura's putting on a show of bravado...

42
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,115
I'll take care of him from here.

43
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,618
Ah... Okay...

44
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,787
Keep it together! Lee!

45
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,378
Oh? Tenten, why are you here?

46
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,880
I came to help.

47
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,673
Huh...?

48
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,134
Those guys,
where's the Sound Village Ninjas?

49
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,595
A kid named Sasuke
drove them away!

50
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,181
Really...

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,976
Why did you hastily decided
to act on your own?!

52
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,103
Besides, you really got beaten up!

53
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,734
S-Sakura was in danger.
So as a man, I...

54
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,945
You're kidding...!

55
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,323
If it were Lee alone,
he wouldn't have lost to those guys.

56
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,242
You're really stupid.

57
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,830
I can't argue with that.

58
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,917
You, Bushy-Brow!

59
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,919
Naruto!

60
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,381
Don't say rude things to Lee!

61
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,009
What in the world...

62
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,262
happened while I was asleep?

63
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:27,267
That Naruto,
he's completely out of the loop.

64
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,438
He's not the type to be
the protagonist of a story, certainly not.

65
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
Lee...

66
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,362
Thank you.

67
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,200
Because of you,
I was able to wake up.

68
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,161
I feel like I've gotten a little stronger!

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,126
Sakura...

70
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,589
It looks like my efforts
weren't enough!

71
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:03,137
Sasuke... Just what you'd expect
from the Uchiha clan.

72
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,347
To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,

73
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,726
just as I thought,
you possess amazing strength.

74
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,270
I was beaten to a pulp.

75
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,149
What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!

76
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,568
What's he talking about?

77
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,362
Were those guys really that strong?

78
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,698
Sakura!

79
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,868
The Lotus of Leaf Village
blooms twice.

80
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,994
Huh?

81
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:31,123
When we meet again,
I will have become a stronger man.

82
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,167
I pledge it.

83
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,004
Okay.

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,133
Hey Sakura!

85
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,676
Come here, come here!

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,179
Your hair! I'll fix it for you!

87
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,265
That'd be great.

88
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,648
You are really sneaky.

89
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,526
Hugging him like that,
you little billboard brow.

90
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,989
It's called first come-first served,
Miss Ino-pig.

91
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,082
Sasuke...Uchiha.

92
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,756
At any rate...he's a strong opponent.

93
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,969
Are you okay, Akamaru?

94
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,973
Is he still shaking?

95
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,643
It's already been half a day.

96
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,686
Akamaru...

97
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,650
I don't blame him,
it's because he saw that thing...

98
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,823
After all, brains are most important
in survival!

99
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,241
Right. Akamaru?

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,869
Lucky for us,

101
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,413
the guys who got caught in
the trap had an earth scroll!

102
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,625
We'll be the first to
the tower at this rate!

103
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,712
Don't get carried away.
That's dangerous.

104
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,259
No matter how small a bug it is,
it has to guard itself at all times.

105
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,804
We have to pay attention to avoid
coming across any enemies...

106
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,597
This is safety.

107
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,683
I know that!

108
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,603
As always, you're speaking in a way
that's difficult to understand, bug-nerd.

109
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,692
Um... B-But...
What Shino said...

110
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,193
He has a point.

111
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,779
I know! C'mon.

112
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,532
Naruto...

113
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,117
I hope nothing's happened to him...

114
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,371
Hey you two, stop.

115
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,419
We're being careful not to
come across enemy, right?

116
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,753
Then Hinata!

117
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,215
Can you see 1 kilometer
in that direction?

118
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,219
Yep... I'll have a look.
Byakugan!

119
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,603
T-There's someone there.

120
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,818
Evidently there are...6 people...

121
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,237
Okay! Let's go look!

122
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,322
Huh?

123
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,284
Kiba! What are you saying?
We're not doing that.

124
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,578
The Proctor told us to bring

125
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,122
one of each "Heaven" and "Earth"
scroll in a pair.

126
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,167
He didn't say not to
take more than that.

127
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,049
If we take more, that means
some other teams will be left out.

128
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,468
B-But...

129
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,511
We'll just see what's going on at first..

130
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,348
If it looks too dangerous,
we won't battle for no reason.

131
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,891
– Let's go!
– Oh!

132
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,561
He's an irritating type, that one.

133
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,738
What's up, Akamaru?

134
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,783
What happened? You stopped suddenly.

135
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,746
Akamaru suddenly got frightened.

136
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,706
W-Why is that?

137
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,753
Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy's
Chakra and tell his strength.

138
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,215
But this is the first time I've
seen him this scared.

139
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,928
The people going at it up ahead
aren't ordinary guys...

140
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:22,521
Sand Village kids coming
to challenge us forthright.

141
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,147
It's foolish.

142
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:39,579
What's that little guy thinking
to get involved with those guys...?!

143
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,377
W-What is Akamaru saying...?

144
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,006
He's saying that big guy is dangerous.

145
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,386
T-They certainly look like bad news...

146
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,221
They seem really strong.

147
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:00,642
Hey, kids, you should
pick your opponents...

148
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,602
You're all going to die.

149
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,813
That's enough of you.

150
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,567
Let's do this quickly...
old chap from Hidden Rain Village.

151
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,405
Which scroll do those guys have...

152
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,449
Hey Gaara!

153
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,659
Doesn't it make sense to
follow them

154
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,995
and gather information
before hunting them?

155
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,291
If they have the same type of scroll
there's no need to fight.

156
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,793
Unnecessary battles are...
It doesn't matter.

157
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,673
If their eyes meet with mine...
I'll kill them all.

158
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,971
That's why I don't want
to be with this guy.

159
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,351
Well, let's do it. Quickly!

160
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,566
Die, kid!

161
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,985
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!

162
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,198
Hidden Senbons!

163
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,874
Up down right left,
there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.

164
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,211
In addition, all the Senbons are
controlled by my Chakra

165
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,129
and attack on the intended prey!

166
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,177
Too easy.

167
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,978
Is that all?

168
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,647
I-It can't be...?!

169
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,731
Not even one...?

170
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,442
No wounds...? Ridiculous!

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,408
Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?

172
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,121
Well, I'll make it rain blood.

173
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,799
What a giant Chakra.

174
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,094
And, that sand...

175
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,054
It smells terrible.

176
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,390
Smell?

177
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,520
A strong smell of blood...

178
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,982
Wall of sand...?

179
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:16,445
That's right.
An absolute defense by sand!

180
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,030
He manipulates sand inside
a gourd and

181
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,408
hardens it with magnified Chakra.

182
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,493
It defends the circumference
of Gaara's body.

183
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,204
It's a Jutsu that only
he can get away with...

184
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,040
Furthermore, it's somehow always
automatically done

185
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,334
without Gaara's intentions.

186
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,214
Which means that all attacks
in front of Gaara fade into nothing.

187
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,092
That little...

188
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,596
You guys can't defeat our Gaara.

189
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,390
Don't underestimate me!

190
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,356
This guy's a goner...

191
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,609
That's what you get for rebelling
against Gaara...

192
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,778
Sand Coffin!

193
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,415
I can't move...

194
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,882
T-This won't...!

195
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,848
I can cover your loud mouth
and kill you.

196
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,483
But that's too pathetic.

197
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,968
Sand Burial!

198
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,649
There's no pain.

199
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,528
I knocked him even harder
than was necessary.

200
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,324
The bloody tears of a corpse merge
with vast sinking sand

201
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,869
and provide more power
to the demon of war.

202
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,039
T-The scroll.

203
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,791
We'll give it to you!

204
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,795
Please! Let us go!

205
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,678
No-o-o-!

206
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,105
T-This is bad.

207
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,400
Let's escape quickly!
If he finds us he'll kill us!

208
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,740
Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.

209
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,951
Okay! Let's go to the tower.

210
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,119
Shut up.

211
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,540
It's still...not enough for me!

212
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,295
U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!

213
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,673
Let's quit...Gaara.

214
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,094
Are you scared, coward?

215
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:36,144
Gaara! It's certainly no problem for you,
but it's too dangerous for us!

216
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,271
One set of scrolls is good.

217
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,814
More than this is...

218
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,903
Lame people don't give directions to me.

219
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,324
That's enough!

220
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,869
How about if you sometimes listen
to what your big brother has to say?!

221
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,415
I've never thought of you as my siblings.

222
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,627
If you get in my way...I'll kill you.

223
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,428
G-Gaara cut it out! Please.

224
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,056
Don't say something so cold.

225
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,601
As a favor to your sister...Okay?!

226
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,084
Gaara!

227
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,470
Fine.

228
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,655
That's why I hate brats.

229
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,582
What? So that's it Akamaru?

230
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,626
C'mon, you should have
said something sooner.

231
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,009
Nobody's here...?

232
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,512
Heh heh! We're the first?!

233
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,432
No, I sensed someone a little while ago.

234
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,727
More importantly, is Akamaru okay?

235
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,105
He's been scared ever since then.

236
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,776
Now that you mention it,
what did Akamaru say before?

237
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,196
Oh... Akamaru said that it
was dangerous

238
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,365
because that sand squirt
would kill that big guy.

239
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,244
Sheesh! Just like I thought,
there's no other place to go!

240
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,789
They've already made us
wait for half a day!

241
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,249
How much longer do we have to wait?

242
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,771
Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...

243
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,399
I don't know what he is but,
that guy...

244
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,859
He's too dangerous.

245
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,372
It's becoming a real disaster,
but we can't cancel this test.

246
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,290
What do you mean?

247
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,959
Excuse me!

248
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,170
What is it?!
We're talking about something important!

249
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,089
Excuse me.

250
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,132
But... Uh...
Please take a look at this!

251
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,968
The video...?

252
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,892
Ready? Here! Look at the time!

253
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
T-This is...

254
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,445
It's a recording inside the tower,

255
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:19,158
one hour and thirty-seven minutes
after the start of the second test!

256
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,664
Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village
broke through the second test.

257
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,711
This can't be...!

258
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,547
In a mere ninety-seven minutes...

259
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,425
This has never happened!

260
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,386
This is an anomaly.

261
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,638
Those guys are not Genin level.

262
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,393
They've rewritten the
fastest time by four hours...

263
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,479
It's not just that.

264
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,940
What do you mean?

265
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,111
It's 10 kilometers
from the test entrances to the tower.

266
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,948
Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,
the rugged forest road...

267
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,368
As if those were not there...

268
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,080
Especially the brown-haired kid
right in front...

269
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,541
What about him?

270
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,709
You don't notice?

271
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,927
I see. This is quite a surprise.

272
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,513
What about him is so...?

273
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,059
Look closely at his body.

274
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,819
I see.

275
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,030
He doesn't have a single scratch.

276
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:43,534
What's worse, there's not
a smudge of dirt on his clothing.

277
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,703
Even I...

278
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,998
No, any of the other Chunin...

279
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,126
It's impossible for us to
make it to this tower without a scratch.

280
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,047
It's likely that it has something
to do with his ability.

281
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,467
After a long time, a dependable
guy has appeared.

282
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,179
Even though he's got evil eyes.

283
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,395
Hey, can you hear it?

284
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:17,443
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

285
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:26,661
The ocean spans limitlessly

286
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,795
Please keep that smile on your face forever

287
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:43,469
Or else I'll cry

288
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:47,390
You won't have to search around you

289
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,185
It's all ok now.

290
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,607
Everyone is inside

291
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,944
this hand

292
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:05,366
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

293
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,912
When you forget what happiness is

294
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

295
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:19,005
Light is born, and darkness was born

296
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,132
The two are one

297
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:27,680
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

298
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,394
Hey, can you hear it?

299
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,983
– Please!
– No!

300
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,693
– Just a little bit.
– No!

301
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,403
– Really only a little bit.
– No means no!

302
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,281
I'll just look a little and put it back.

303
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,284
Remember what the
Proctors said, loser.

304
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,952
When they say don't look, don't look,

305
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,288
it just makes me want
to look all the more!

306
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,332
If you can look when you can,
let's look!

307
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,876
Naruto lost it!
Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

308
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,463
Next episode: "The Scroll's Secret:
No Peeking Allowed"

309
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,381
I really want to look!
