1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,426
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,256
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,937
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,623
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,093
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka

19
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,555
At this point in time,

20
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,018
I don't even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.

21
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,062
Sakura!

22
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,398
Do you know who
you're lipping off to?!

23
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,235
Don't press your luck,
crybaby Sakura!

24
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:54,156
It seems like...
it seems like Sakura was out of line!

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,535
Ino's eyes show incredible anger.
She's scary.

26
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,994
Hmm.

27
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,247
That's not it...
Huh?

28
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,999
Sakura's not the kind of kid
to do things

29
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,503
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,466
She doesn't like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.

31
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,028
– This time for sure,
– This time for sure,

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,489
– with full strength,
– with full strength,

33
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,787
– a fair...fight!
– a fair...fight!

34
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,500
The Ultimate Battle: Cha!

35
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,520
Just a Clone Jutsu...?!

36
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,607
This isn't a Ninja Academy's
graduation exam!

37
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,442
You think you can beat me...

38
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,402
with a textbook ninja art?!

39
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,656
If I look carefully, I can find out,
which is the real one right away...

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,618
Chakra to my feet at a burst...Then...

41
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,828
repel off the ground!
Fast!

42
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,046
If you think I'm the crybaby Sakura
I was until recently,

43
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,881
you'll get your fingers burned!

44
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,508
Come like you mean it, Ino!

45
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,972
I appreciate you saying that...

46
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,976
I'll go like I mean it, as you wish!

47
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,860
Way to go Sakura!

48
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,863
Great! Really great!

49
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,782
With the fundamental movements
using Chakra,

50
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,325
she's topnotch among the rookies...

51
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,409
Huh?

52
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,162
Sakura is at her best.

53
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,415
That means...
Is she better than me?

54
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,751
Well! That's right.

55
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,127
Awww!

56
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,965
Sending Chakra all throughout
the body and

57
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,259
using the technique
with it at a right timing...

58
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,304
Those techniques alone
are better than Sasuke.

59
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,057
Well, from the start,
she was extremely good at...

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,228
controlling her Chakra, so...

61
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,065
Magnificent movements, Sakura!

62
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,745
However, her opponent is good too.

63
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,456
This evenly-matched battle
looks to take awhile!

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,885
Since when did this girl
get this strong?!

65
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:05,806
I can make it, too...!

66
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,517
You little...!

67
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,567
Whoa!

68
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,863
At this rate, it'll never end.

69
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,450
This is long...

70
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,578
They've been going at it
for ten minutes, at the least.

71
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,467
You shouldn't be evenly
matched with me!

72
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,389
What makes you think
I'm evenly matched with you...

73
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,059
who's only concerned with looks
and growing your hair frivolously?!

74
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,314
You!

75
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,733
You carry your mocking
of me too far!

76
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,026
Idiot.

77
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,403
She's going for the bait.

78
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,782
Who knows what Ino will do!

79
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,534
I don't like Ino when she's that way...!

80
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,846
You're simple-minded...

81
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,515
Uh-oh.

82
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392
She's totally lost it!

83
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,190
I don't need this!

84
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,532
S-Scary...

85
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,618
I'll put an end to this right now!

86
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,288
I'll make you say that you lost!

87
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,250
Hey, don't tell me...

88
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,210
Could it be...?

89
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,423
As I recall, that Sign is...

90
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,342
I knew it...

91
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,845
She's planning to do
the Mind Transfer Jutsu!

92
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,472
Man...That idiot!

93
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:16,353
I understand your feelings of frustration,
but that's futile.

94
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,980
Humph!

95
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,815
I wonder!

96
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,734
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu...

97
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,322
A Jutsu where the user can take
over the opponent's spirit

98
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,283
and wrest their body away
for a few minutes...

99
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,161
by discharging all of
their own spiritual energy

100
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,788
and striking the enemy with it.

101
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:40,127
But, there are major flaws
to this formidable Jutsu.

102
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,713
First,

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:49,261
the discharged spiritual energy
can only fly straight and at a slow speed.

104
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:56,602
Second, even in the case of failing
to hit the enemy and missing,

105
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,229
the user can't return to her
own body for several minutes.

106
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,692
I should add that during
that interval, the user's,

107
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,280
in other words, your main body
will turn into a doll that won't move at all!

108
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,159
In the first place, the Mind Transfer
Jutsu is used for spying

109
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,286
and is not a Jutsu for battle.

110
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,667
Ino, using that Jutsu here
would be equal to suicide...

111
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,129
It shouldn't be particularly
scary if she moves about...

112
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,715
And not only that,
if she dodges the Jutsu,

113
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,259
she can beat the heck out
of the non-moving opponent.

114
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,473
If that happens, Hayate will be forced
to put an end to the match...

115
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,975
So what?!

116
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,102
I won't know unless I try!

117
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,231
If you miss, it's over.

118
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,067
You know that, right?

119
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,863
In the first place,
it's a combination Jutsu to be used

120
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,407
after stopping the opponent's
movements during a battle

121
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,533
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

122
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,077
There's no way!

123
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,537
There is no way, it will hit...

124
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,295
Idiot! Stop!

125
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,257
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

126
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,147
Which one...?

127
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,199
That was unfortunate...

128
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,786
Ino.

129
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,330
Has the fat lady sung...?

130
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,291
She went and did it...

131
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,003
Then, it's over, eh.

132
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,426
This is...?!

133
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,889
You fell for it, Sakura!

134
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,352
I finally caught you!

135
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,813
It can't be!

136
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes, it can.

137
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,738
My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,

138
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,284
to drive you who was running
about into this contrivance.

139
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,202
So?

140
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,705
You can't move at all, can you?

141
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,792
It's special rope that's my hair
with Chakra poured in!

142
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:33,550
With this, it will be over when
I enter your body and say "give up!"

143
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,263
It wouldn't miss
a hundred percent of the time!

144
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,724
I see...

145
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,978
That idiot... Her losing it
was also an act?

146
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,688
Get out of there, Sakura!

147
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,399
I can't move...!

148
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,401
Then...

149
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,445
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

150
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,471
That was unfortunate...

151
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,516
She missed!

152
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,726
No!

153
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,311
Sakura...

154
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,687
Sakura!

155
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,525
Sakura!

156
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,672
W-What's with Ino?

157
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,510
Also... Sakura's acting kind of strange!
Believe it!

158
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,762
But...surely this is her chance!

159
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,223
Do it, Sakura!

160
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,434
It's no use.

161
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,895
To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there...

162
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,188
Sakura's had it.

163
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,233
Mind Transfer...?!

164
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,945
That means Sakura right now is...

165
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,989
Yes.

166
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,410
Sakura's spirit has been
completely taken over by Ino.

167
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,578
What?!

168
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,665
Ino is inside of Sakura's body now!

169
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,125
Well.

170
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,627
Ino's purpose is most likely...

171
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,756
With this, it's over.

172
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,135
Good bye, Sakura...

173
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,318
I...Sakura Haruno concede...

174
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,070
– this match...
– No!

175
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,822
Sakura!

176
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,158
Tsk!

177
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,035
He's annoying!

178
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,787
You did your hardest to get here!

179
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,500
You'll disgrace women if you lose
to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!

180
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,629
Like I said, those words
are useless...

181
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,425
What's...

182
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,307
this bad chill...?!

183
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,939
Naruto is annoying!

184
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:42,280
Anyway, that's right...
not to Ino I won't ...

185
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,075
Sakura?!

186
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,910
This can't be happening...

187
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,248
What's the matter?

188
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,542
Are you conceding?

189
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,547
I won't be conceding!

190
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,215
No Way!

191
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,426
Cha!

192
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,180
Which is it?

193
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,141
W-What's going on?!

194
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,393
Sakura...?!

195
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,812
No way!

196
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,484
I messed up my Jutsu...?

197
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:25,782
Ino...You'll have a terrible time of it
if you don't get out of me quick!

198
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,246
What's wrong, with Ino?

199
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,672
No... I won't hold on at this rate...

200
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,549
Release!

201
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,364
It can't be...
She shattered Ino's Jutsu!

202
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,868
She used too much energy
before the Jutsu...

203
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,204
So she didn't have enough Chakra...?!

204
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:22,297
To think she has two spirits...
What are you?!

205
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,346
Strength that ranks with beauty.

206
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,016
Girls can't survive if they're not tough!

207
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,852
If caught in that spell,

208
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,980
it's not that easy to cast out
the invader...

209
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,567
Ino's lack of Chakra...

210
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,444
There's also that...

211
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,488
But what was more effective
than that...

212
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:51,201
was the combative spirit towards
Ino she has inside her heart.

213
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,872
So that was awakened with Naruto's voice
as the trigger

214
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,458
and she cast Ino out...?

215
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,710
There's nothing to it.

216
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,337
Like Naruto...

217
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,925
Sakura's fighting spirit was
much stronger than others.

218
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,343
– This is...!
– This is...!

219
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:14,683
But, both of them should
have hardly any Chakra left.

220
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,604
– This is...
– This is...

221
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,064
– the end!
– the end!

222
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,011
Both parties are unable
to continue the match!

223
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,472
By double knockout,

224
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,225
no one gets through the
fourth battle of the preliminary!

225
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,060
– What?!
– Huh?!

226
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,690
Now then...

227
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,442
Good grief.

228
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,528
Hey, Ino!

229
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,654
Sakura!

230
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,989
Sakura!

231
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,867
A-A-Are you okay?!

232
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,672
Treatment's not necessary.

233
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,343
They'll probably wake up after awhile.

234
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,226
But, that was surprising...

235
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,310
Yeah...

236
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,397
Naruto and Sasuke aside...

237
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,693
to think even that Sakura who didn't
have what it took has grown this much...

238
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,739
A lot happened,

239
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:38,243
but I really feel like it
was a good thing...

240
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,371
sending her to this Chunin Exam.

241
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,674
Tenten vs. Temari

242
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,681
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!

243
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,600
Now...

244
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,644
The second one from the
Land of Sand, huh...

245
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,605
– This looks to be an interesting match.
– Do your best, Tenten!

246
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,076
It looks like you finally
woke up, eh...Sakura.

247
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:25,039
Huh?! Tenten, power of youth!

248
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,416
Go Go!

249
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,419
There is no limit to your youth!

250
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,505
Our match is already over.

251
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,472
Did I...lose?

252
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,437
I'm the one who wants to cry...

253
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,190
To think I tied with somebody like you...

254
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,901
Huh?

255
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,403
Here!

256
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,700
You also got a flower to bloom, didn't you?

257
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,119
A beautiful flower!

258
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,835
Ino...

259
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,596
However...

260
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,015
the next time we fight,

261
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,142
it won't end with you
getting knocked out!

262
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,226
Hm...?!

263
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:32,774
And... I won't hand over
Sasuke to you!

264
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,862
I return the same line to you!

265
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
– Humph!
– Humph!

266
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,160
The fifth battle...

267
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,831
Tenten, Temari...
come forward!

268
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,103
Hey, can you hear it?

269
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:15,233
The clear, blue sky

270
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:19,445
goes on and on

271
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,115
The ocean

272
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:28,538
spans limitlessly

273
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,332
Please keep

274
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:37,296
that smile on your face forever

275
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,428
Or else I'll cry

276
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

277
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,227
It's all ok now.

278
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is inside

279
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,986
this hand

280
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:05,158
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

281
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,746
When you forget what happiness is

282
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,750
Just sing.

283
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,921
Light is born, and darkness was born

284
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

285
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,056
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

286
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,561
Hey, can you hear it?

287
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,815
You know! You know!

288
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,651
I feel like women battles
are incredible, or...

289
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,780
Women are scary.
Huh?

290
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,991
Hey-hey! This isn't the time to be
withdrawing, Shikamaru.

291
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:51,621
You're kind of a plain, or a lousy,
or an unimpressive guy, aren't you?

292
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,999
If you don't really put your whole heart
into it, things will get hairy for you.

293
00:22:55,083 --> 00:23:00,338
Next episode:
"Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru"

294
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,216
This is really, seriously bad!
