1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,563
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,817
I just want to convey

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,320
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,165
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:45,254
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:51,218
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you,

8
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,928
right?

9
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:57,308
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:04,231
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

11
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,026
In time,

12
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,198
we'll realize that it was everything

13
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:18,454
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

14
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,415
Trembling thoughts

15
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:28,506
swept into a vortex and melting away

16
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,934
The Leaf's Handsome Devil!

17
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,821
Blast!

18
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,783
No matter how many times you try...

19
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,913
it's the same!

20
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,642
I'll acknowledge you.

21
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,228
You're not only sharp...

22
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,063
You're also very determined...

23
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,360
In addition, I'm nice, too...

24
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,366
Striking a helpless woman
is against my policy...

25
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,784
But however I look at it,

26
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,328
you don't have the feel of
a helpless woman...

27
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,206
in your case!

28
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,133
Don't be getting full of yourself

29
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,636
just because you released
the Genjutsu, you little clod...!

30
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,223
She's still not completely bound.

31
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,100
Damn it...

32
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,061
I can't lose!

33
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,527
A little more...

34
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,467
What Chakra she has?!

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,302
Even if I bind her at point-blank range,

36
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,387
she still pushes back...

37
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,225
But, I'll get hammered
for sure if I let go now.

38
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,648
After all, I just have to put this
to rest with this Jutsu.

39
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,427
Hang in there, Akamaru!

40
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,507
Damn it... What's going on?!

41
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,455
Damn it!

42
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:48,223
One more...to go...

43
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,727
This guy's crazy strong...

44
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,191
Not a single hit with that
many shadow clones...

45
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,152
It's about time...

46
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,654
I've been eagerly waiting.

47
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:11,038
Lord Orochimaru's ambition...
The first step...

48
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,296
Sasuke...

49
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,140
Sasuke! What're you doing
with these guys?!

50
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,143
Come on! We're going home now!

51
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,274
Sasuke...

52
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,359
Hey...

53
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,330
Should we go home?

54
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,498
Yeah!

55
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,879
We've both made it to the top!

56
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,341
I want to fight you too.

57
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,055
Hey... We're going home.

58
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,021
Everyone's worried about you.

59
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,191
So...

60
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,868
Sasuke!

61
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:17,748
Please. Bring back Sasuke...!

62
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,710
You can hear my voice, can't you?!

63
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,675
Wait, Sasuke!

64
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,640
It's futile...

65
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,018
Die.

66
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,694
Who're you?

67
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,075
The rejuvenated...

68
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,828
Leaf Village's Handsome Devil...

69
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,337
Rock Lee!

70
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,358
B-Bushy Brow...?

71
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,948
Bushy Brow, you! What about your body...?

72
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,993
More importantly, Naruto. Go get Sasuke.

73
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,996
But...you...

74
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,583
Please leave this person to me!

75
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,549
This guy's...good...

76
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:55,887
Bushy Brow! Be careful!
He uses his own bones to attack.

77
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,857
Bones...you say...?

78
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:13,405
He's crazy strong...

79
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,292
What're you doing?! Please go, quickly!

80
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,253
Naruto...

81
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:32,049
You also promised Sakura
with a "nice-guy pose," right?!

82
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,180
I'll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!

83
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,474
It's a promise of a lifetime!

84
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,561
This person...I'll beat him!

85
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,439
I promise!

86
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,777
Right!

87
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,366
I won't let you!

88
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,873
Die.

89
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,587
Please don't ignore me!

90
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,256
Oh...

91
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,053
Bushy Brow...

92
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,556
You don't have the time to be inattentive!

93
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,396
Good response!

94
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,168
However...

95
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,423
If Sasuke is inside that coffin...

96
00:11:55,215 --> 00:12:00,178
It'd be totally impossible to take them
on with a Genin team...

97
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,141
We Jonin are in this plight...

98
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:09,771
We should organize a special team
and send them out for backup.

99
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,731
We can't do that...

100
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,569
Ever since Orochimaru's attack,

101
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,614
the Leaf is currently losing strength
as a great land.

102
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,869
You understand that the Jonin
and Chunin are being totally mobilized

103
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,789
in order to take out possible domestic
and international dangers.

104
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,006
Even if the Sharingan were to fall
into Orochimaru's hands...

105
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,346
We should now prioritize
avoiding war with other lands.

106
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:49,769
But... I'm sure the Orochimaru situation
isn't a problem that can be deferred forever.

107
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,982
If he regains power...
He'll promptly attack again...

108
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,984
I know...

109
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,488
I'm not such a fool.

110
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,867
I was sure to think about it and
measures have already been taken.

111
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,873
In here!

112
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,927
What's wrong, Guy?
You're on the brink of exhaustion.

113
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,428
Did something happen on your mission?

114
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:29,309
No... I took care of the mission
and ran back with all of my might...

115
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,313
More importantly...

116
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,985
Lee! What happened with Lee's surgery?!

117
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,909
It was a success.

118
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,289
He can start training starting tomorrow
if it's just for Jutsu.

119
00:13:55,877 --> 00:14:00,340
Well, bed rest for a while
would be best though.

120
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,343
Th-There's trouble, Lady Fifth Hokage.

121
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,346
Rock Lee is gone!

122
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,270
No!

123
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,426
Next will be the end.

124
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:58,356
Damn it... Last night while
I treated Genma and Raido?

125
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,860
Lee...

126
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,577
That fool... He went after them.

127
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,044
And...he must've been really flustered...

128
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,888
He took my bottle of sake for
a bottle of medicine by mistake...

129
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,935
SAKE

130
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,988
Sake?!

131
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,618
Uh...Uh-oh...

132
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,288
What's wrong, Guy?

133
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:02,462
Actually, when Lee drinks even
a little bit of alcohol...

134
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,888
Things get...so messy...

135
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,933
Get so messy?

136
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,269
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

137
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,418
He's agile... My kicks don't hit.

138
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,462
You're flexible to a surprising extent...

139
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,382
And you make unique movements, eh?

140
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,095
You're too...straight forward.

141
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,729
It's over...

142
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,398
Please wait!

143
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,412
I'm sorry.
It's about time for my medicine!

144
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,289
I have to be sure to drink it, so...

145
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,707
Excuse me a moment.

146
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,636
I've always disliked medicine.

147
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,229
It...happened before when
I took him to a restaurant

148
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,232
to celebrate his acquisition
of the "Hidden Lotus."

149
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,195
Lee mistook my sake for water...

150
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,617
As soon as he drank just a small cup...

151
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,582
of the sake, things got ugly...

152
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,542
Got ugly...?

153
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,467
After a silence that was like
right before a storm...

154
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,894
The moment I realized it,

155
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,229
the restaurant...

156
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,817
had gotten all messed up...

157
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,780
Medicine always tastes stran...

158
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:50,672
What...? What did this guy drink?

159
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,886
Messed up? What do you mean?

160
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,098
He's terribly...!

161
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,311
Lady Tsunade... Lee goes into

162
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,025
an incredible drunken frenzy!

163
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,610
Huh...?

164
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,915
Who the heck are you?! Hey!

165
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,460
Geez, who are you anyway?

166
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,130
Acting cool... So irritating...

167
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,344
Hence, he's a natural user of...

168
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,322
Drunken Fist!

169
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,548
Sasuke!

170
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,272
For the first time, I spoke to you

171
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,526
And you smiled

172
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,778
For the first time, I was able to speak

173
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

174
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,495
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

175
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:32,750
Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage

176
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,631
My clumsy attempts with words

177
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:44,345
You listened without turning away

178
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,810
No wonder I get carried away by you

179
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:57,900
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

180
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,611
I feel so sad

181
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,863
But...

182
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,990
For the first time, I spoke to you

183
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,868
And you smiled

184
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,787
For the first time, I was able to speak

185
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,540
In my own words

186
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,334
For the first time, I spoke to you

187
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,254
And you smiled

188
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,090
For the first time, I was able to speak

189
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,885
In my own words

190
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,973
For the first time, I spoke to you

191
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,816
You fell for it, didn't you?!

192
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,651
How about my strategy?

193
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,780
This is the Shinobi Secret
of reading the double bluff!

194
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,658
Guy Sensei! I did it once again! Yeah!

195
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:51,579
But, what's this?! The world is oddly...

196
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:57,335
f-floating,
and I've no inclination of losing!

197
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:01,339
Next episode: "The Beast Within."
