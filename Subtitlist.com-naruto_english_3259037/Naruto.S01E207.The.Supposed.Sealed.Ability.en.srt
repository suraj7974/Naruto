1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,882
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:13,139
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,289
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,384
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,266
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,315
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,780
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:17,077
into your hands

12
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:22,708
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,012
Kiba!

15
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,183
Naruto!

16
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,729
You okay, Kiba?

17
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,648
Yeah...

18
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,025
Is this also Genjutsu...?!

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,655
No one, including Akamaru,
can escape from Yakumo's Genjutsu.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,448
It's because...

21
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,993
we have an enlarged neural tube...
the cerebrum...

22
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,455
Guys, move away from the door!

23
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,124
Parasitic Insects.

24
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,642
Please, Sensei...
Tell me the truth.

25
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,521
If you don't...I'll rub you out...

26
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,023
I reached the decision
to seal your Genjutsu power

27
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:30,234
at my own discretion.

28
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,236
It has nothing to do with
the Third Hokage...

29
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,162
Vent your resentment...

30
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,666
The only one you should hate is me...

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,168
I heard...!

32
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,671
I heard you and
the Third Hokage talking

33
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,340
about trying to destroy
the Kurama Clan!

34
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,429
Yakumo, you've got the wrong idea.

35
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,722
You lie!

36
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,601
No way could my mother
and father die in just a fire!

37
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,861
My parents were killed...!

38
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,698
What?!

39
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,705
Shino...

40
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,629
What's this?!

41
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,589
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

42
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,510
All right!
I'm counting on you guys!

43
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,762
–Right!
–Right!

44
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,388
Now, I'm ready when you are...

45
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,768
One, two...

46
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,811
Charge!

47
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,690
Go!

48
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,862
N-Naruto...

49
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,287
Naruto?!

50
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,249
Kurenai Sensei!
What happened to your...?

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,169
Yakumo, did you do this...?

52
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,173
That person tried to eliminate me...

53
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,008
So she's just facing the consequences.

54
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,635
You're wrong!

55
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,554
Yakumo, you've
misunderstood something.

56
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:30,854
I heard everything about you and
Kurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.

57
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,064
Stop, Naruto!

58
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,318
Listen up.
Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers

59
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,613
because she cares about you!

60
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,782
What're you talking about?!

61
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,284
You're not the only one who's suffering!

62
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:49,957
Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all
this time and has suffered alone!

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,208
Stop!

64
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,963
The...truth...?

65
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,719
The Supposed Sealed Ability

66
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,727
Guy Sensei!

67
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,730
Hey, where is everyone?!

68
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,025
Shino and Hinata are standing
watch in the hallway,

69
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,777
but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto

70
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,447
are now inside the world
created by Yakumo's Genjutsu!

71
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,199
Huh? What do you mean?!

72
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,201
I'll explain...

73
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,120
Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.

74
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,166
No... I must now
explain the truth...

75
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,588
Nobody has taken such affectionate care
of Yakumo as Kurenai.

76
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:43,385
Kurenai's resolve was to get Yakumo
to give up on being a Shinobi...

77
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,224
Yakumo was completely in low spirits.

78
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,020
Lord Murakumo was also concerned...

79
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,982
Then one day, that incident occurred...

80
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,904
The residence of the head family
burned to the ground

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,824
and Yakumo stood motionless
in front of it...

82
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,786
I saw it at that time...

83
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,582
The form of a monster with
a face like a female demon

84
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,251
hovering in the flames...!

85
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:26,011
After learning of its identity...
I became frozen with terror.

86
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,604
What is...the truth?!

87
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,191
Sensei... What the heck is happening
to Yakumo...?

88
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,275
This is bad...!

89
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,237
Yakumo! You don't know...

90
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,739
You don't know anything!

91
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,251
Something's... Yes...

92
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,420
There is something...
in the recesses of my mind...

93
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,091
But... What is it...?
I can't remember...

94
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,761
Oh no...!

95
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,471
Naruto, stop that!

96
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,556
Huh?!

97
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,100
Naruto!

98
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,770
What is this thing?!
Damn it. Let me go!

99
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:40,419
All I want to do is live up to
everyone's expectations, and yours.

100
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,923
And yet...
Why does everyone get in my way?

101
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,137
I just want to become a Genjutsu user...

102
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,182
People have their respective
appropriate paths.

103
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,143
You probably have your own path.

104
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,227
That's right...

105
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,772
There's no need to force yourself
to become a Shinobi...

106
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,317
No... I don't want that!

107
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,569
Everyone may comfort me with words...

108
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,323
But I know.
I know they're disappointed in me.

109
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:14,786
I can't stand having to live
my whole life feeling that burden.

110
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,461
Yakumo, what's that...?

111
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,671
R-Run, Uroko!

112
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,481
Yakumo!

113
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,912
I remember...

114
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,206
Yakumo...?!

115
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,252
Yes...me...

116
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,546
The person inside me killed
my mother and father...!

117
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,050
I killed them with Genjutsu!

118
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,095
No, Yakumo!
That wasn't you...

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,890
You and that monster are different!

120
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,643
No, we're not different...

121
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,982
You see, that thing...
was living inside my heart.

122
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,823
Thanks... Kurenai Sensei...

123
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,286
Goodbye...

124
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,453
Stop!

125
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,039
Yakumo!

126
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,349
Wh-What's...that...?!

127
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,939
In order for us to get
a clear picture of the incident,

128
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:09,609
we first requested
a complete examination of Yakumo...

129
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,160
As a result, we learned the monster
that appeared at the time of the fire

130
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:24,583
was an Id Monster so to speak,
created by Yakumo's sub-consciousness.

131
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,547
An Id...Monster...

132
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,552
Then I made a direct appeal
to the Third Hokage...

133
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,473
Ultimately, Yakumo could
not endure the weight

134
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,518
of living up to our expectations
from the time she was little

135
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,105
and that triggered her sub-consciousness
to attempt to expunge everything.

136
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,235
Yakumo's sub-consciousness
will probably attempt to

137
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:58,492
expunge the Kurama Clan
and eventually the entire Leaf Village.

138
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,244
I cannot consent to that...

139
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,039
Despite such a risk,

140
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:10,462
taking the life of Yakumo who has
no awareness of evil cannot be allowed!

141
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,714
It'll be too late

142
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,551
once her sub-consciousness
completely awakens!

143
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:22,224
Then we just have to get her
to learn how to control it herself...

144
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,144
or seal her powers if that's not possible.

145
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,105
But...

146
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,733
Although slightly different
from Yakumo's case...

147
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:37,697
There's a precedent of a baby being used
to seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.

148
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,324
That's absurd...!

149
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,493
There isn't a Jutsu practitioner

150
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,121
who can seal the strong powers
Yakumo possesses...

151
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:49,084
There might be just one person
who can accomplish that...

152
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,005
However, it will become
a painful mission.

153
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,509
Hopefully, this person can teach her
how to control her powers...

154
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,885
But if it comes to sealing her powers,

155
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:04,182
the Jutsu practitioner will end up
erasing all the potential in the child...

156
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,144
The Jutsu practitioner will
have to live with the burden

157
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,939
of Yakumo's resentment
in place of the Kurama Clan...

158
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,737
The Third Hokage said that
and then cried.

159
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,158
The one who accepted that
painful mission was...

160
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,619
Yuhi Kurenai.

161
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,122
I see...

162
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,083
So that's what Kurenai Sensei
was talking about.

163
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,337
I...didn't know anything about Sensei...

164
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,676
I knew that Kurenai had sealed
Yakumo's powers...

165
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,886
But it's the first time I've heard

166
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,263
about the incident
her sub-consciousness caused.

167
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,309
Yes... The Third Hokage passed away

168
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,605
and at this point, it's a secret known only
to the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.

169
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:56,651
She made herself into the bad guy
and kept the secret, huh...?

170
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,070
Kurenai Sensei...!

171
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,615
You go, too!

172
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,450
–But...
–Sakura...

173
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,327
I'll take over things here...!

174
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,621
Guy Sensei...

175
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,831
You're concerned about Naruto
and the others, right?

176
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,334
-Go to them...!
-Right!

177
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,882
I leave Yakumo...to you...

178
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,473
What is it...?

179
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,017
I don't know... But...

180
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,894
This feeling...

181
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,230
It's somehow
entirely different from before...

182
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,152
My insects are acting strange.

183
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,115
What's going on inside?!
Is Kurenai Sensei okay?

184
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,245
It's powerful...

185
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,791
A massive Chakra beyond compare
is being produced...!

186
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,878
Naruto...

187
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:13,728
Why...? Why do you have
to take your own life...?

188
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,230
What...?!

189
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,107
What must be destroyed are the ones

190
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,151
who forced you to shoulder
a heavy burden

191
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:25,448
and on top of that,
tried to eliminate me...!

192
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,575
Who're you...?

193
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:34,374
I crept into an opening in the depths
of your mind and was nurtured.

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,210
My name is Id...!

195
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,351
She's finally awoken...

196
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,314
Kurenai Sensei,
what is that thing?

197
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,694
It happened soon after I was made
Yakumo's personal instructor.

198
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,699
It was when I had doubts about
the high level of Yakumo's Genjutsu

199
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,161
and looked into her deep psyche.

200
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,123
I discovered that thing!

201
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,403
I could only stand motionless
in front of that terrible figure.

202
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,908
It wasn't Yakumo whom
the Third Hokage said to eliminate...

203
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,410
It was her Id monster...

204
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,331
So that's what it was...?

205
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,711
This ominous ghastliness...
is more powerful than before.

206
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,880
But I must stop it from getting
into the real world,

207
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,049
even if we have to kill each other...!

208
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,677
Kill each other?!
I see...

209
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,595
She was that determined...

210
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,931
So that's why she quit Squad Eight.

211
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:19,354
I'll take your feelings into this body
and settle the score...

212
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,277
You jerk!

213
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,951
You're in the way. Move it!

214
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,413
Naruto!

215
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,963
I don't know
what the heck you are...

216
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,634
But Kiba, Shino, Hinata,
they're all waiting for Sensei's return!

217
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,845
Naruto...!

218
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,723
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

219
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,560
My Jutsu won't activate in this world...!

220
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:03,606
You are a thorn in my side...
I'll erase you first.

221
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,609
Look out!

222
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,156
Yakumo, you're the only one
who can defeat it now!

223
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,282
What...?

224
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:17,996
Listen, Yakumo... All people have
a fanged beast in their minds...

225
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,791
It always lives in the depths of
a person's mind

226
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,127
and will suddenly appear.

227
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,465
The power of the beast that
appears is enormous and

228
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:33,595
regardless of one's own will,
it can inadvertently hurt those around it.

229
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,808
But...if that monster can be tamed

230
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,352
and then controlled
with one's own power...

231
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,565
It becomes a magnificent power

232
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,068
and acts to make
your dreams come true.

233
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,323
Now, fight!

234
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,701
Abate by your own hand
the monster you created!

235
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,662
B-But...

236
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,166
Yakumo, only you can do this!

237
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,588
Die, boy...

238
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,467
Darkness in my mind, abate!

239
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,386
Die!

240
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,276
Why...?

241
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,657
I...served...you well...

242
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,639
Kurenai Sensei,
you're back to normal!

243
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,562
Kurenai...Sensei...

244
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:12,026
You did well, Yakumo...
You defeated your own darkness.

245
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,071
Sensei...

246
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,076
You did it, Yakumo...

247
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,813
Yakumo...

248
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:55,194
She knew exactly who was
really trying to save her...

249
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,614
–Kurenai Sensei!
–Sensei...

250
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,243
It's okay now!

251
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,786
Kurenai Sensei...

252
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,581
You'll go back to being
everyone's teacher, right?

253
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,917
That's right...

254
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,587
My final mission from
the Third Hokage is over...

255
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,089
–Sensei!
–Sensei!

256
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,553
That's great that things could
get back to normal...

257
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,888
Sakura...!

258
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,045
Naruto...?

259
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,006
I will too.

260
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,103
The Key to the rusted heart's door

261
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:16,067
Will always be smiling right near by

262
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,411
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

263
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,999
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

264
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,670
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

265
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:40,508
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

266
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:45,054
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

267
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:49,726
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

268
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,272
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

269
00:21:54,355 --> 00:22:01,154
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

270
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,700
The wind is probably testing our hearts

271
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:10,663
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

272
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:15,334
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

273
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:20,131
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

274
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,635
The Key to the rusted heart's door

275
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:30,391
Will always be smiling right near by

276
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,483
This isn't funny!

277
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,110
Why do we have to get all worn out
for someone like him?

278
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,279
Exactly! We were told to protect
the Beauty of Nature,

279
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,906
but he keeps getting in our way.
Is this some kind of joke?

280
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,408
Plus, he uses people as scapegoats
and shields.

281
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,994
He thinks it's only natural for
Shinobi to die in missions.

282
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,788
I can't take this anymore!

283
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,414
Me neither.
If it comes to this, then I'm...

284
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,374
– ...gonna use Rasengan!
– ...gonna use Gatsuuga!

285
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,795
– And beat up this client up so bad!
– And beat up this client up so bad!

286
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,547
Next time:
"The Weight of The Prized Artifact!"
