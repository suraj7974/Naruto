1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,804
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,868
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,579
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,082
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,503
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,177
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,615
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,412
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,553
Laughing Shino

17
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,849
Shino!
Let's rest a little!

18
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:43,062
I'm tired from doing nothing but
walk since this morning, believe it!

19
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,148
You're okay while
you can say you are tired.

20
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,860
It's because you still have
energy left to talk.

21
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,822
Nothing but quibbling as usual...

22
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:56,325
Man, I'm unlucky. To be stuck on a mission
alone with Shino.

23
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,542
Hey, old lady.

24
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,044
Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?

25
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,464
Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?

26
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,590
Yeah!

27
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,802
Then you'll be right there
once you cross this path.

28
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,179
Really? Thank goodness.

29
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,641
But exercise great caution...

30
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,059
Huh?

31
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,396
Dead people also laugh
in Motoyoshi Village...

32
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,440
It will be all over if
you're lured into laughing.

33
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,409
Naruto.

34
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,369
It's Motoyoshi Village.

35
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,540
We never imagined it at this time...

36
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,501
To think that in this village...

37
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,423
an incident too terrifying to
even talk about would occur...

38
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,803
In Mourning

39
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,444
I'm Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.

40
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,737
I'm Shino Aburame.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,655
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,575
Will
Getting right down to business...

43
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,830
This is the will of my father,
Tobei Kagetsu.

44
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,499
What's this?!

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,544
My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,797
shall inherit the entire
Kagetsu family estate...

47
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,759
HOWEVER...

48
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,512
A funeral is to be held tomorrow
in Motoyoshi Village

49
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,933
for the head of the Kagetsu family
that owns that stretch of mountains.

50
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,935
I'd like you two to go.

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,688
Funeral security, huh?
Naruto can't do it.

52
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,565
What do you mean?!

53
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,276
It's because you have
the most inappropriate face

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,028
in the Leaf Village.

55
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,948
Say what?!
I think so as well.

56
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,117
But there's nobody else.

57
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,454
So I reluctantly decided
to add Naruto.

58
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,916
You'll be the main guy
on this mission, Shino.

59
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,087
You're probably the best suited
for this mission.

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,171
Huh?

61
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,175
As it happens, there's one more important
mission in addition to security.

62
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,136
You'll understand when
you see the will.

63
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:26,392
However, in the event that Futa raises
his voice in laughter at the funeral,

64
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,228
he shall lose inheriting rights
and upon consultation,

65
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,106
the estate shall be divided up between
the bereaved family members excluding Futa.

66
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,734
This will doesn't make any sense at all...

67
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,195
An abundance of medicinal herbs
can be picked in the mountains

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,406
owned by the Kagetsu family.

69
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,282
I would have no trouble getting
by for the rest of my life

70
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,659
if I were to inherit the estate.

71
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:48,622
But all that will all go down the drain
just by laughing at the funeral!

72
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,792
There's no doubt that the relatives
will be in a frenzy

73
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,586
trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.

74
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,756
To be honest, I don't have the confidence
to withstand it.

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,099
But there is one salvation!

76
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,519
According to the will,
it's acceptable if I, the chief mourner,

77
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,603
were to appoint a substitute!

78
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,314
And so I commissioned the Leaf!

79
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,735
I asked for someone who
absolutely will not laugh!

80
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,612
This is no doubt the perfect mission
for Shino.

81
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,198
I've never seen
this guy laugh before.

82
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,285
Indeed, I leave it to you.

83
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,203
I understand.

84
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,833
Big Brother, dinner's ready.

85
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,335
This is my little sister Mai,
the youngest.

86
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,672
She lived together with
my father in this large home.

87
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,341
She was also the one at his deathbed
during his final moments.

88
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,636
Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.

89
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,388
Nice to meet you...

90
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,726
Let's eat!

91
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,188
Wait! First, I'll taste for poison.

92
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,689
Taste for poison...?!

93
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,233
I don't think there would be anyone
among the relatives

94
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,735
who would go that far...

95
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,654
But you can never be too careful.

96
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,698
You've got a point.

97
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,117
Will you be all right, Shino?

98
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,120
No problem.
Even if it did contain poison,

99
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,664
the Parasitic Insects in
my body will dissolve it for me.

100
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,627
Parasitic...Insects?

101
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,722
How is it?

102
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,977
It's all right...

103
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,816
Shino...laughed?!

104
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,288
He seems to be in very high spirits.
Which means the food is fine...

105
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,915
Don't eat!

106
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,961
Shino laughing like
this is definitely strange, believe it!

107
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,589
There's a laughing drug in this food!

108
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,303
Who cooked the food?
I did.

109
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,765
But the back door isn't locked...

110
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,101
So anyone could get in if they wanted to.

111
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,063
To think there would be
someone in the family

112
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,274
who would go so far as to poison!

113
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,611
Oh, no...The drug has gotten to the insects!

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,699
No good...
They can't dissolve the drug.

115
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,244
Then what will we do about
the funeral tomorrow?!

116
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,166
This is a sight that doesn't seem
of this world, believe it!

117
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,333
Naruto!

118
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,087
Even if we were to contact the village
now, we wouldn't be in time...

119
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,797
for the funeral...

120
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,551
So Naruto!

121
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,890
You... will have to participate in the
funeral as the chief mourner's substitute!

122
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,059
No way...

123
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,311
Naruto.

124
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,065
I'm very uneasy, but I'll be counting on you.

125
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm also very uneasy, believe it...

126
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,706
Will you knock it off?! I can't sleep!

127
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,086
You're early, Tsukiko.

128
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,380
You're already here, huh?

129
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,593
It's dad's funeral, after all.
I came here in great haste.

130
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,430
Who's that kid?

131
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,725
This is Naruto whom I've asked to
be my substitute as chief mourner

132
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,809
since I'm not feeling so well.

133
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:38,894
Nice to meet you!

134
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,981
That's how it's going to be,
so I will be leaving just with the greetings.

135
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,610
I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.

136
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,655
To think you can't inherit the estate
if you laugh at the funeral...

137
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,491
Be careful.

138
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,912
She's my immediate younger sister
in question, Tsukiko.

139
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,831
Five years ago,
she married into the next village over...

140
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:04,336
But she's probably the one
after this estate the most.

141
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,590
That kid will be a cinch.

142
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:15,347
Each and every one of them...
looks greedy...

143
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,065
What's that...?

144
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,618
The monk has arrived.

145
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,135
Why choose a monk like this,
of all people?

146
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,469
I have no knowledge of this!

147
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,389
It's a different person from
the monk at the meeting.

148
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,064
Don't laugh... Don't laugh...

149
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,027
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

150
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,238
Now then, allow me to begin.

151
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,667
What was that sound?

152
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,669
Wasn't it the wind blowing?

153
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,174
Naruto, did you not raise your voice
and laugh just now?

154
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,593
No, I didn't!
I didn't laugh at all, believe it!

155
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,762
Mai, you heard it, right?

156
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,640
I don't know... I only heard the sound of
barrels falling over.

157
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,810
Well, fine.

158
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,772
The funeral has only just begun.

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,483
There are still plenty of chances...

160
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,861
After all, the opponent is this kid
with a stupid look.

161
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,322
I'm saved...

162
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,704
Shino, huh? Thanks!

163
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,916
That was a close shave...

164
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,840
In order, please.

165
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,967
Then I'll go first.

166
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,436
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

167
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,773
No good... He won't laugh at that...

168
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,401
I'll give it one more push.

169
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,903
Don't laugh...!

170
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,863
I must not laugh!

171
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,074
This kid is nothing.

172
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,536
I'll kill him with laughter with
that technique of mine...

173
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,664
This guy also intends on
doing something, huh?

174
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,542
No matter what he does,
no way will I laugh!

175
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,964
Kiyoyasu!

176
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,842
–Kiyoyasu!
–Kiyoyasu is...

177
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,926
Here it comes...

178
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,848
Whatever he hits me with. I...!

179
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,268
I must not laugh!

180
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,229
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

181
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,192
A flower came out...

182
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,902
Don't laugh...!

183
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,114
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

184
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,708
Don't laugh, don't laugh, don't laugh...

185
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,918
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

186
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,589
I won't laugh...no matter what!

187
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,341
He's pretty tough...

188
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,387
But how long can he hold on for?

189
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,851
We'll make him laugh by the time
the funeral ends without fail!

190
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,361
That...old woman...

191
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,324
Dead people also laugh
in Motoyoshi Village...

192
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,744
It will be all over if you're lured
into laughing.

193
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,788
What's she doing in a place like this?

194
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,542
Who's there?!
Uh, oh!

195
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,755
Oh, it's you Mai...

196
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:41,905
With this, it's over!
We'll put this in everyone's tea!

197
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,241
But...

198
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,285
Everything will go well with this!

199
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,579
I don't know about that.

200
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,165
Who're you?!
Shino...

201
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,131
I heard everything...

202
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,686
How frustrating...

203
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,523
If this guy would just laugh,
I'd get some of the estate...

204
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,609
Thank you indeed for today.
Allow me to thank you all...

205
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,237
in place of the chief mourner.

206
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,906
With this, the mission is complete...

207
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,618
It looks like it will somehow
end all right.

208
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,705
Once the monk goes home,
the funeral will be over.

209
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,248
Please wait!

210
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:38,461
Please let my husband say
thank you as well. Okay, dear.

211
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,348
Hi! Thanks for coming today.

212
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,225
Huh?
Huh?

213
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,728
Wh-What's he going to do?!

214
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:59,441
It was a very nice funeral.
I was so moved!

215
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,820
It's tear-jerking.

216
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,911
That Tsukiko...
To think she would go this far.

217
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,581
Naruto, if you can get through this,
it will be over.

218
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,374
Please withstand it...!

219
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,837
It doesn't hurt at all!

220
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,049
I must remember something sad
at a time like this!

221
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,928
Why do I think of the Pervy Sage
at a time like this?!

222
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,972
All right, now is the time
to finish him off.

223
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,645
This is awful!
The tears are causing my face to collapse.

224
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,104
What're you talking about?

225
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,566
Your face...is right here!

226
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,361
N-No!

227
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,948
Oh, no...
Yes!

228
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,202
What?

229
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,003
D–Dad...

230
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,299
You're alive? Dad?!

231
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,843
Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!

232
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,762
Dad hates fighting!

233
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,181
I've thought up a good joke.

234
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,725
I've thought up a good joke, too.

235
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,687
Who're those kids...?
Where'd they come from?

236
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,314
I'd get dad to laugh, first!

237
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,650
I will be the first! You stay out of it!

238
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,152
Stop it! Fighting's wrong!

239
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:31,574
It's as Mai says.
Fighting's wrong! Wrong.

240
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,077
Futa! Tsukiko!

241
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,079
–Futa?!
–Tsukiko?!

242
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,248
N-Now that you mention it...

243
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,252
Yeah...They are indeed us
from our childhood!

244
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,716
Oh, fighting's wrong! A kettle's a kettle!

245
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,428
My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!

246
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,764
Groping is wrong!
Hot sake is where it's at.

247
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,892
My wife's secret stash is kept in a safe.

248
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,602
Between my legs...

249
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,271
Ding, dong, ding.

250
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,482
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.

251
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,278
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.

252
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,447
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.

253
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,116
–That's right...
–Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

254
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,326
–When we were kids...
–Ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.

255
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,036
–Dad made us laugh a lot
–Ding-dong-ding.

256
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,788
–with his silly jokes...
–Ding-dong.

257
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,123
–It's been a long time
–Ding. Ding.

258
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,250
–since I laughed at dad's jokes...
–Dong-dong-dong. Dong

259
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,379
–Dong-dong
–This is it! This is what I wanted to see!

260
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,680
Dad!

261
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,557
Then who's this?

262
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,898
The laughter stopped.

263
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,109
Shino!
I'm sorry, everyone!

264
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:52,697
But I didn't think you'd all come
if it weren't my funeral...

265
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,368
Mai helped me out a bunch
and this was the plan.

266
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,622
Is that really you, Dad? You're alive.

267
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,041
Why'd you do this?!

268
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,794
In the old days,
before we knew that

269
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,838
the medicinal herbs we could pick
in the mountains would be profitable...

270
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,341
We were poor...

271
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,676
But we were bursting with laughter.

272
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:21,684
However, we got rich from selling
the medicinal herbs at a high price.

273
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,728
And when we'd open our mouths,

274
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,939
we'd start saying,
"Money! Money! Money!"

275
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,692
And the smiles vanished from
everyone's faces.

276
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,864
I wanted everyone to remember
what's important.

277
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,493
I wanted to get back
the family's smiling faces!

278
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,912
If I wrote that ridiculous will,

279
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,040
everyone would do stupid things
trying to get Futa to laugh.

280
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:49,045
And then not only Futa,
but everyone would laugh and have fun...

281
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,965
Happiness isn't money!

282
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,760
It's living while getting along
with everyone and laughing!

283
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,265
I remember...

284
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,644
Sure enough, laughter is important.

285
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,229
That's right...

286
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:10,400
To be honest, I'm sick of living
at the mercy of money.

287
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,778
You liar! You're the one saying
money this and money that the most.

288
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,240
There are different kinds of "money,"
and what I was talking about was...

289
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,243
This bell.

290
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,386
Could that be...?

291
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,971
It's the laughing drug.

292
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,473
It's still at experimental stage, though.

293
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,727
If I made it okay to appoint
a substitute chief mourner,

294
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,398
Futa would summon someone
who definitely wouldn't laugh.

295
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,942
So I tested it out on that person first.

296
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,239
I was going to make everyone laugh
by putting this in everyone's tea

297
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,492
if nobody had laughed by
the end of the funeral.

298
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,161
But...

299
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,790
There's no point to laughter
using a drug...

300
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,585
It's because the people
wouldn't be laughing

301
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,545
from the bottom of their hearts.

302
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,635
Instead, they'd be crying in their hearts...

303
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,180
Like me right now!

304
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,063
So at the end of the day,
what happened with the mission?

305
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,106
It's probably a success.

306
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,778
It's because the Lady Hokage probably
knew about the real mission.

307
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,071
Say-say.

308
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,115
You transformed into that old man, right?

309
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,578
Then the "Between my legs,
ding-dong-ding" thing was something you...

310
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,081
Forget about that.

311
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,417
Absolutely forget about that.

312
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,004
O-Okay, got it.
Then, fine.

313
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,884
Sure enough, I...

314
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,137
I can't get used to this guy...

315
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,234
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

316
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:23,074
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

317
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,423
Yellow Moon.

318
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:45,263
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

319
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:50,560
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

320
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:57,442
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

321
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:04,407
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

322
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:11,080
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

323
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:17,879
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

324
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:24,719
A magical chord change, in a restless city

325
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:31,768
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

326
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,317
The mission this time around is
a commission from the Land of Greens

327
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,485
and is protection for
some traveling merchants.

328
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,904
This is just a D-rank mission.

329
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,238
Don't complain.

330
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,365
The castle lord there
is a benefactor of mine.

331
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,034
Make sure you do nothing wrong.

332
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,328
I could manage a mission like
that asleep, believe it.

333
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,412
Very well.

334
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,372
However, I've got an important reminder
for you.

335
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,707
Reminder?

336
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,334
Make sure you don't forget to take this
with you to the site.

337
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,752
That is all.

338
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,297
Next time:
"Open for Business!
The Leaf Moving Service."
