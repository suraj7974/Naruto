1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,594
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,019
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,902
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,995
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,999
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,258
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,010
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,891
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,851
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,520
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,945
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,369
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,584
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,630
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,243
Such intensity...

21
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:03,833
If I take a breath or move my eyes
I will be marked and killed –

22
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,417
that's what I'm feeling..

23
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,297
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad.

24
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,968
Facing a Jonin intent to kill...

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,138
This sensation is like having
my life held in limbo...

26
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:24,603
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!

27
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,273
Sasuke...

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,236
Don't worry. I'll protect
you all with my life.

29
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:38,534
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.

30
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,416
I don't know about that...

31
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:53,883
It's over.

32
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,081
Sensei! Behind you!!

33
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,630
Die!!

34
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,726
The Water Clone Jutsu...?

35
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,437
It can't be.

36
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,943
Don't move!

37
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,328
The Oath of Pain

38
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,385
It's over.

39
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,846
W-Wow!!

40
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,693
Did you say it's over?

41
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,154
You don't understand, do you?

42
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,451
You won't be able to beat me
just by making like a monkey...

43
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,161
No chance.

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,585
But, I must say you're good.

45
00:04:54,253 --> 00:05:00,342
My Water Clone Jutsu was
being copied at that point...

46
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,055
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.

47
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,894
By letting the clone
talk as if it were you,

48
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,023
you succeeded in distracting me.

49
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:20,988
And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu
to hide yourself to see what I was doing...

50
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,491
But...

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,203
I'm not a fool.

52
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,915
That one was a fake too!

53
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,848
Now!

54
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,936
Makibishi spikes...!

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,150
How foolish...!

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,070
Sensei!

57
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,615
Oh, I can't believe that
Kakashi Sensei got ...

58
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,825
kicked away like that...

59
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,788
His Taijutsu skills are also
extremely good.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,754
W-What's with this water...?
It's awfully heavy.

61
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,548
Fool!

62
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,133
It's the Water Prison Jutsu!

63
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,219
Darn it.

64
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,556
My temporary escape into the water...

65
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,058
was a huge mistake!

66
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,270
You're caught...

67
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,023
It's a special prison that makes
it impossible for you to escape!

68
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,486
It makes things harder
having you able to act.

69
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,280
Now...Kakashi.

70
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,616
I'll have to settle things with you later.

71
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,246
First, I will finish those guys off.

72
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,456
Water Clone Jutsu...

73
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,417
Didn't expect this level of skill...

74
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,433
You're acting big,
wearing a headband like a Ninja...

75
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,771
But...a real Ninja is one

76
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,859
who has hovered between
life and death numerous times.

77
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,610
In other words,

78
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,780
only those who are worth being listed
in my Bingo Book

79
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,241
deserve to be called Ninja.

80
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:35,247
Guys like you can't be called real Ninja.

81
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,082
He's disappeared again!

82
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,219
You're just a kid!

83
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,180
Naruto!

84
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,019
You three! Take Tazuna and run!

85
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,687
You have no chance against this guy!

86
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,815
As long as he has me trapped
in this Water Prison,

87
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,358
he won't be able to move from here.

88
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,319
And he shouldn't be able to use
the Water Clone Jutsu

89
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,779
if he's far enough away
from his real body.

90
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,948
In any case, just run for now!

91
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,576
Run away?

92
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,203
You've got to be kidding me.

93
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,665
That option was gone
from the moment you got caught.

94
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,168
Even if we ran,

95
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,922
without you, sooner or later
we'd be defeated by Zabuza...

96
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,882
and we'd all be destroyed.

97
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,761
Even if we were to reform
the Manji defense,

98
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,805
it would be impossible
to block his attacks.

99
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,557
In the end...

100
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,559
we'll have...

101
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,519
no options left.

102
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:44,983
In order for us to survive,
our only option is to rescue you.

103
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,652
We'll just have to do it!

104
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,252
There...!

105
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,711
Too easy.

106
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,887
Sasuke!

107
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,265
Sasuke...

108
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,439
T-This is the Jonin level... A real Ninja...

109
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,359
We've got to run... At this rate...

110
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,529
Seriously...! Seriously...!

111
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,322
We'll be killed!!

112
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,261
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!

113
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:00,517
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued...

114
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,188
I'll never be afraid or be a coward.

115
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:10,152
Are you hurt...scaredy cat?

116
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,780
I won't lose to Sasuke.

117
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,628
Can I borrow that
Leaf headband for a while?

118
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,297
This?

119
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:36,803
This is worn only by those who have
graduated from Ninja Academy.

120
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:42,768
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

121
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,356
Congratulations on your graduation.

122
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,066
That's because you're all squirts

123
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,319
who don't have the qualifications
to become Ninjas.

124
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,032
Missions are all risky assignments.

125
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,035
You pass!

126
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:06,124
I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!

127
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,002
I'm going to surpass the Hokage!

128
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,671
And so I'm going to get the entire Village

129
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,591
to acknowledge my existence!

130
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,843
That's right...

131
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,555
I am a Ninja now. And...

132
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,518
I decided that I was not going
to run anymore!

133
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,520
That I wouldn't run away...!

134
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,110
Y-You fool! Stop it!

135
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,322
Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!

136
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,325
Fool...

137
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,259
What are you thinking...
charging off on your own?!

138
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,469
Even Sasuke is no match for him...

139
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:04,182
No matter how hard we try,
we Genin are no match for him...

140
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,323
The headband...?!

141
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,926
Hey! You, with no brows...

142
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:46,141
Record in your Bingo Book...

143
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,352
about the man who will one day
become the Leaf Village's Hokage.

144
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,320
Leaf-style Ninja...

145
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,740
Naruto Uzumaki!!

146
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,162
Naruto...

147
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,627
When I first saw that little kid,
he seemed so unreliable...

148
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,755
Sasuke! Lend me your ear!

149
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,964
What is it?

150
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,633
I have a plan.

151
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,637
You want to discuss plans
under these circumstances...?

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,971
This guy...!

153
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,100
You are talking of teamwork?

154
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,021
W-What is this feeling...?

155
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,815
Was Naruto so...?

156
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,859
Now...

157
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,029
Let's get wild...

158
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,774
Now, let's get wild!

159
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,740
Such loud snorting,
but do you have a winning plan?

160
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,201
T-This isn't good...

161
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,621
What are you guys doing!
I told you to run!

162
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,832
It was obvious what was going to happen
once I was caught!

163
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:34,916
Hurry! Run!

164
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,337
Listen to me!
Our mission is to protect Tazuna!

165
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,922
Have you forgotten that?!

166
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,885
Old man...

167
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,391
Well...

168
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,061
This is a seed that I planted...

169
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,732
I can't say that
I want my life to be spared.

170
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,444
Sorry, you guys...

171
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,613
Fight as much as you want!

172
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,866
You hear that?

173
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,535
Are you ready?

174
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,922
You guys really haven't learned
anything, have you?

175
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,841
W-What?!

176
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,261
You're still playing at being Ninja?

177
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,848
When I was your age,

178
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,685
this hand was already
stained red with blood!

179
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,106
Zabuza, the Demon!

180
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,611
Ohh...? It seems that you've heard of me.

181
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:52,035
A long time ago, in the Mist Village,
often called the town of Blood Mist,

182
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,830
Ninja candidates faced
their biggest hurdle.

183
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,544
So you also know about
that graduation exam...

184
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,047
That graduation exam?

185
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,259
What is it...?

186
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,220
This graduation exam
that you're talking about...

187
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,687
The students killed each other.

188
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,021
What...?

189
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,821
Classmates who had shared rice
from the same pot

190
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,782
formed pairs and tried to kill each other.

191
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,535
It didn't end until one of them died.

192
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,417
Partners who used to talk about
each other's dreams and aspirations...

193
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,003
How cruel...

194
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,798
Ten years ago,

195
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,386
the Mist Village's graduation exam
was forced to undergo drastic reform.

196
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:58,309
That was because an evil demon had
appeared on the scene the previous year.

197
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,024
Reform?

198
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,155
What about the reform?

199
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,949
What had that evil demon done?

200
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,496
With no scruples or hesitation...

201
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,125
a young boy who didn't even have
the qualifications for being a Ninja,

202
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,422
annihilated over a hundred examinees.

203
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,269
That sure was...fun...

204
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,075
Sasuke!

205
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,095
Die!

206
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,682
Darn!

207
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,434
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

208
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:31,361
Ah...Shadow Clone Jutsu,
and there are quite a few of them.

209
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,510
Here I go!

210
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,156
It's impossible, after all...

211
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,659
There is no way that
you can defeat the guy!

212
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,000
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy!

213
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,501
Sasuke!

214
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,967
I see! So that's your plan, Naruto!

215
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,927
That's pretty good for you!

216
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,527
Demon Wind Shuriken,

217
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,778
Windmill of Shadows...

218
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,207
A Shuriken won't work on me.

219
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:27,894
I see. This time
it's aiming for my real body...

220
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,939
But... It's not so easy!

221
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,278
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow...!

222
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,573
This is... The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

223
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,118
A second Shuriken in his blind spot!

224
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,171
But...

225
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,800
Still too naïve...

226
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,386
He dodged it!!

227
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,693
Here it is!

228
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,582
Yes! The plan worked!!

229
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,461
That Zabuza had no clue
as to what I was thinking,

230
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,297
and I fooled him!

231
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,508
Ninja must be able
to see through the obvious.

232
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,720
Did you see that – the Leaf-style fighting
of Naruto Uzumaki?!

233
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,431
Kakashi Sensei, the rest is up to you.

234
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,434
Next episode:
"Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior!"

235
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,145
I'm going to kick butt once again!
