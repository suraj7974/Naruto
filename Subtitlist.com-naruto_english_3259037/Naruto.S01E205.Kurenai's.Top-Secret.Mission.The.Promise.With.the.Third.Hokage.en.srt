1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:06,590
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,472
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,366
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:38,956
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:44,795
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,801
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,224
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:04,315
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I'm not by your side

9
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,529
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

10
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:17,077
into your hands

11
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:23,209
I can feel it so close,

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:28,756
Our two hearts

13
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:47,149
This is my chance to show my master
the fruits of my training!

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,507
These two are under Genjutsu...

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,810
Yakumo?

16
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,812
Is that Yakumo?

17
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,789
So you were safe!

18
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,712
Help me!

19
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,301
It's okay now Yakumo.

20
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll protect you!

21
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,391
Kurenai Sensei!

22
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,903
Top-Secret Mission:
The Promise with the Third Hokage

23
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,199
The two who went in first
haven't come back, huh?

24
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,245
Sure enough, is Yakumo in
a state of awakening?

25
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,124
You two handle
Yakumo and Kurenai...

26
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

27
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,505
You handle the nuisance
that's heading this way.

28
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,840
Yes, sir!

29
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,853
What?!

30
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,108
Leave it to me...

31
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,364
That emblem...!

32
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,076
You're with the Kurama Clan...?!

33
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,038
Yuhi Kurenai...
Hand over Yakumo quietly.

34
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,416
What does the Kurama Clan
plan to do with Yakumo?!

35
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,877
This is a clan issue.

36
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,046
It doesn't concern you.

37
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,466
Yakumo is the child I've
taken custody of,

38
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,926
from the Third Hokage.

39
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,845
Then, by force...

40
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,478
No!

41
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,702
You can't escape now!

42
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,583
What's this?!

43
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,252
To think she'd make it look like
she got caught in a Genjutsu

44
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,295
and then trap us in
a Genjutsu...!

45
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,424
Damn it! Where'd she go...?

46
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,969
It hurts...

47
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,178
You okay...?!

48
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,847
Wha...?!

49
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,119
You jerk!

50
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,537
Oh, Naruto!

51
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,788
– Hey! Hold it.
– H-Hey!

52
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,500
Take this!

53
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,420
What?!

54
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,758
Ow-ow... Hm?!

55
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,976
This bean stalk is too damn big!

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,861
What?

57
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,573
I-I can't move...!

58
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,745
This is not good!

59
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,580
Naruto!

60
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,248
Die!

61
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,958
Shino!

62
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,628
What?!

63
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,382
Genjutsu doesn't work
on the insects...

64
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,467
Damn it.

65
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,719
Wh-What...?!

66
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,110
He vanished?!

67
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,365
There!

68
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,576
No matter where you hide,
you can't cover up your scent!

69
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,120
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
Man-Beast Clone!

70
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,289
Fang Over Fang!

71
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,296
Yes!

72
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,135
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

73
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,893
No chance a half-baked Genjutsu would
work on us fully trained Ninja!

74
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,270
Stop!

75
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,647
– Huh?
– Let go, let go! Let me go!

76
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,315
Jeez!

77
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,860
– Naruto!
– Let go!

78
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
Dispel!

79
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,289
What?! Sakura...

80
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,499
Morning...

81
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,085
It's because you charge right
into an enemy's Jutsu on your own.

82
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,838
Oh! Kurenai Sensei and Yakumo?!

83
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,801
Kurenai Sensei!

84
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,517
Who're these people?!

85
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:02,024
All four of them have been caught in
a Genjutsu and are unconscious.

86
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,317
Kurenai Sensei!

87
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:08,071
S-Sensei... Kurenai Sensei!

88
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,451
She's nowhere to be found!

89
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,245
Byakugan!

90
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,586
What is it?!

91
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,463
K-Kurenai Sensei has...

92
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,097
Another one...still...

93
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,066
Just like that...
To think they'd cast a Genjutsu on me.

94
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,609
Dispel!

95
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,402
What?! It won't wear off?!

96
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,875
It's Unkai who served as
the replacement leader

97
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,503
of the Kurama Clan
after my father died.

98
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,007
Unkai from the Kurama Clan...
I see.

99
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,468
Things won't go as they did
with the others, eh?

100
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,223
Kurenai Yuhi, Genjutsu user.

101
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,725
I'm embarrassed to be praised by you...

102
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,187
I'd like to avoid needless battle.

103
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,816
Hand over Yakumo.

104
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,611
Hang on tight.

105
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,406
You may very well be
Kurenai Yuhi,

106
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,368
but how do you intent
to fight within my Jutsu?!

107
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,877
Oh, no!

108
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,844
Damn you!

109
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,180
I smell blood!

110
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,812
Heh. I won't let you escape...

111
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,484
There!

112
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,371
Next, I'll pierce your heart...

113
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,374
Hand over Yakumo.
Why do you protect her?!

114
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,635
Kurenai Sensei!

115
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,026
I won't let you touch Kurenai Sensei!

116
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
Look out!

117
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,406
Wha...?! Not again!

118
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,619
Geez, when will you
ever learn, Naruto?!

119
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,828
Byakugan!

120
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,416
Naruto! The enemy's above you!

121
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,584
Huh?!

122
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,339
Byakugan, huh?!

123
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,966
If you're coming at me
with Genjutsu, then...

124
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,552
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

125
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,306
Go!

126
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,646
Clones, huh?!

127
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,816
Heh! Mine aren't just illusions.

128
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,067
Let's go!

129
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,235
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

130
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:40,325
U-zu-ma-ki!

131
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,161
Naruto Barrage!

132
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,090
I'll definitely get Yakumo...

133
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,678
Byakugan!

134
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,782
Yakumo has been sedated to calm
her nerves and is asleep now.

135
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,076
But it would be best for her

136
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,370
to have a complete examination
back at the village hospital.

137
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,957
It was a big help having
you here, Sakura.

138
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,210
You should also get
some first-aid treatment, Sensei.

139
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,088
Right... Thanks.

140
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,840
Okay, please show me.

141
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,475
They've been like this the whole time.

142
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,186
It doesn't look like they'll wake up
from the Genjutsu

143
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,770
for quite a while...

144
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,565
Well, I guess that serves
our interests better. Hm?

145
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,943
It's...!

146
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,531
Kurenai Sensei!

147
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,623
Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!

148
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,541
Y-Yes...

149
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,502
She's not okay!

150
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,711
Wha...?!

151
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,090
I gave her some first-aid treatment,
but she has a deep wound.

152
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,551
We must get back to the village quickly...

153
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,470
Don't worry about me.

154
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,805
I'm more concerned about
Yakumo's instability.

155
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,185
Yeah, their comrades could
very well return.

156
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,478
I'm also concerned about

157
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,899
how we haven't seen the three people
who were assigned to guard Yakumo.

158
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,026
All right!

159
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,238
Leave this to me and all of you
head back to the village

160
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,906
with Kurenai and Yakumo!

161
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,158
Organize a back-up unit.

162
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,244
Your opponents are practitioners
of Genjutsu.

163
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,079
Will you be okay alone?

164
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,830
What?

165
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,290
This fully...

166
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,750
...trained body!

167
00:13:55,043 --> 00:14:00,924
I won't be dazed by the likes
of the Kurama Clan's Genjutsu!

168
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,430
A pun?

169
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,399
Oh?

170
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,234
Are you awake?

171
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:29,619
Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei
for sealing your Genjutsu?!

172
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,000
That person hates me...

173
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,922
She didn't want to make me into
a practitioner of Genjutsu.

174
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,466
It's not like that!

175
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,884
Then...why?!

176
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,096
I'm sure she had some kind
of reason!

177
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,890
You would've been in trouble
had Kurenai Sensei

178
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,852
not risked her life to save you before!

179
00:14:54,686 --> 00:15:00,358
That was the Kurama Clan...
People from the same clan as me.

180
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,568
What?

181
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,529
What?! Why would people
from the same clan as you...?

182
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,121
Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei
back to the village?

183
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,584
I'm fine...
I can at least do that myself.

184
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,668
Kiba?!

185
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,087
Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!

186
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,757
Tell us the truth!

187
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,844
Isn't this incident and you
quitting our squad...

188
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,721
somehow related?

189
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,315
The Kurama Clan into
which Yakumo was born...

190
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,069
was once a force in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

191
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,530
as a family of Genjutsu users.

192
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,909
However, they had been brought
to ruin in recent years,

193
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,662
unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.

194
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,333
Then a rising star brimming with
talent appeared in the clan.

195
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,709
And that was Yakumo.

196
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,921
My parents and relatives placed
their hopes in me,

197
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,300
the only daughter of
the head family.

198
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,848
But I was in poor health and
my official entrance into the Academy

199
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,517
was not acknowledged.

200
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,270
I had wanted to live up
to the expectations

201
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,147
of my parents and the clan...

202
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,192
and I got really depressed.

203
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,116
My father saw me like that

204
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,494
and negotiated directly with
the Third Hokage for me.

205
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,458
The Third Hokage whom
Murakumo consulted

206
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,503
realized the high level of
Yakumo's latent power

207
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,256
and decided to leave her
in my custody.

208
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,843
By the order of the Third Hokage,

209
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,888
Kurenai Sensei became
my personal teacher.

210
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,974
But...

211
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,770
Y-Yakumo?!

212
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,358
Kurenai Sensei... She...!

213
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,894
Why?!

214
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,232
I don't know.

215
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,194
Maybe since I'm a Genjutsu user too,

216
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,822
I got jealous of the high level
of Yakumo's latent powers.

217
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,074
Jealous...?!

218
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,828
Genjutsu practitioners with
higher powers than mine

219
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,455
are not necessary in this village.

220
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,875
No way. You'd do that for
a reason like that...?

221
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,543
You understand, don't you?

222
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,171
A selfish person like me can't continue
to go on missions

223
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,090
with your lives entrusted to me.

224
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,135
I can't believe that!

225
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:19,682
It's not just her...
I'm a hindrance to the Leaf Village.

226
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,643
Wh-What do you mean?

227
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,729
Sure enough, I can't believe it.

228
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,525
Isn't Kurenai Sensei still hiding
something from us...?

229
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,862
I also...get that feeling.

230
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,489
Exactly.

231
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,575
It's because...

232
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,037
Kurenai Sensei's hand shook
with heartache

233
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,833
when she talked about events
in the past.

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,755
But the shaking stopped...
when she talked about her motive.

235
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,800
What do you mean?

236
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,635
That motive is a lie.

237
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,930
The heart is not affected by
a made-up story.

238
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,809
Then her being jealous of Yakumo...

239
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,020
Perhaps she's protecting someone.

240
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,357
Someone so important
Kurenai Sensei would protect?

241
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,818
That would be, for example...

242
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:21,619
I overheard Kurenai Sensei
and the Third Hokage talking.

243
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,507
Yakumo's powers probably
will not awaken for a long while.

244
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,888
I see. But the time will eventually come

245
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,931
when the dam bursts and
her powers will pour out.

246
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,102
That power of the Kurama Clan
will eventually threaten

247
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,480
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

248
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:55,069
At that time,
we'll have to eliminate it.

249
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:07,165
Even the Third Hokage was
involved with the sealing of my powers.

250
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,877
The Third Hokage would
never order something like that!

251
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,298
My parents died just before

252
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,300
I started training under
Kurenai Sensei.

253
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,551
What?!

254
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,970
There was a sudden fire.

255
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,516
It seems the fire spread quickly
and they couldn't be saved...

256
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,604
But my parents were even Jonin!

257
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,523
To think they would die
just in a fire.

258
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,859
And a fire in broad daylight
on top of that...

259
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,030
And although after that,
I was told there was no foul play...

260
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,159
the autopsy reports were
classified and sealed.

261
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,915
No way?!
It wasn't just an ordinary fire?

262
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,295
My parents were killed on
order of the Third Hokage...!

263
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,845
No way...!
No way could that ever be true!

264
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:09,978
The Key to the rusted heart's door

265
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:15,984
Will always be smiling right near by

266
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,244
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

267
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,915
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

268
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:35,586
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

269
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,425
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

270
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,388
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

271
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,726
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

272
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,105
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

273
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:58,860
I'll change it right away,

274
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,571
lighting it with all my feeling

275
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,450
The wind is probably testing our hearts

276
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:10,538
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

277
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:15,126
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

278
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:20,048
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

279
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,510
The Key to the rusted heart's door

280
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:30,975
Will always be smiling right near by

281
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,775
The story I heard from the girl.

282
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,610
The story I heard from
Kurenai Sensei.

283
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:45,114
Which one is true?
It's unlikely that they're all lying.

284
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,158
But I can say this.

285
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:51,037
There's no way the Third Hokage
would think about eliminating the girl.

286
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,163
For the time being,

287
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,956
I've got to get Sensei and
the others to the hospital quick...!

288
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,375
What's this?!

289
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,755
Next time: "Genjutsu or Reality?"
