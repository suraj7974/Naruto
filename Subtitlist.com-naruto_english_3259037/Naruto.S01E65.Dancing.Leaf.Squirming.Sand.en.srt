1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,351
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,311
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,961
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,176
The winner is Temari.

24
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,366
Oh, I'm tired...

25
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,915
Oh, what a waste!

26
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,710
Why?! He had a chance to
become a Chunin!

27
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,880
Shikamaru is Shikamaru...

28
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,680
Really... Does he or doesn't he
have the motivation?

29
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,725
Even I'm not sure about it.

30
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,232
But his intelligence and strategies
are no longer at the Genin level.

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,196
If it had been an actual mission
for a basic platoon,

32
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,492
the win was decided when
he captured Temari...

33
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,581
So, I suppose he won the competition,
but he lost the match...

34
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,460
It's unfortunate he shows no
signs of being motivated,

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,007
on the other hand,
he won't get too emotional

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,467
or fall into a panic.

37
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,052
And that's exactly why...

38
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,929
he'd be able to calmly pull back

39
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,599
if he viewed a situation
as totally hopeless.

40
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,477
That could be attributed to
calm judgment.

41
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,187
Shikamaru probably possesses...

42
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,150
the most important psychological

43
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,944
element required for a Chunin...

44
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,614
the disposition of a leader!

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,876
In order to evaluate someone
as a leader of a platoon...

46
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,547
it's much more important to
protect the platoon from danger,

47
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,841
than to carry out a mission.

48
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:39,011
Yeah...it'd hardly be worth mentioning
a completed mission

49
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,097
if everyone was annihilated.

50
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,391
The risks and the mission
should be put on a scale,

51
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,811
surviving should be thought of first,
and then action should be taken.

52
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,939
A person who can't do this isn't
qualified to become a Chunin.

53
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,193
Hyuga and Naruto from earlier
fail on that point.

54
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,535
Although they are all right
as insignificant Genin.

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,290
Well, I do feel like Shikamaru
gave up too soon too.

56
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,253
What do you think?

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,006
What do I feel...?

58
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,052
He has more of a chance
than Naruto, for sure!

59
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,428
Shoot...!

60
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,060
Why the heck did he give up!

61
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,938
Is he an idiot?!

62
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,523
This ticks me off!

63
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,735
I'm gonna really give him a lecture!

64
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,489
So the one that's gonna
become a Chunin is...

65
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,117
You idiot!

66
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,577
Shut up, super idiot!

67
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,623
Why the heck did you give up?!

68
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,085
Let's not talk about that anymore,
all right?

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,755
It's not all right! It was a match
you were close to winning!

70
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,383
– Let's just watch the next match.
– But you just gave up!

71
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,968
Unimaginable!

72
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,220
Simply unimaginable!

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,930
Huh? The next match?

74
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,063
Sasuke...!

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,277
Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand

76
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,949
At last, Uchiha's match is next.

77
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:28,245
-Oh, but who's this opponent Gaara?
-I wonder...

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,540
But compared to Uchiha,
he's nothing much.

79
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,169
Do you know?

80
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,130
I hear Uchiha's gonna
withdraw from this match.

81
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,590
Really?!

82
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,302
Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious
injury while training before the match...

83
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,220
Are you serious?

84
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,558
And to think I took time off
specifically to see this match!

85
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,268
I'm counting on you, come on!

86
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,774
As you'd expect, this match
will be won by Uchiha.

87
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,695
No way, I've got high hope
for the new one of the Sand.

88
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,239
He won't let this one slip by.

89
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,702
As they say about the world
of competition...

90
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,874
It's impossible to predict
what will occur...

91
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,121
Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,

92
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,206
he has not yet arrived at the arena.

93
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,252
Umm...it's unavoidable...

94
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,798
We can't make the guests
wait any longer.

95
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,591
Another ten minutes.

96
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,887
Why don't we wait just
another ten minutes?

97
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:09,972
But...

98
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,601
The guests are looking forward
to the next match above all else.

99
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,938
Cancelling it would be cruel.

100
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,484
Since it's come to this,
waiting another ten minutes wouldn't hurt.

101
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,363
Lord Hokage...?

102
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:27,906
Umm...

103
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,033
Uchiha, where are you!

104
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,910
What's keeping you?
Hurry up!

105
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,791
There is some truth to what
Kazekage says.

106
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,963
So shall we extend it for
ten minutes from now.

107
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,346
So...let Genma know of this.

108
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,182
Yes!

109
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,774
If it stays like this, Uchiha will really
be forced to withdraw.

110
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,574
I see...a ten-minute extension...

111
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,456
Sasuke...

112
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,380
Hey, isn't that...

113
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,355
Y-You are...

114
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:49,071
But, what's that idiot doing!
He's still not here?!

115
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,159
Sasuke...!

116
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,870
Please!

117
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,582
Good of the two of you to make it!

118
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,751
Come now, hurry into the arena!

119
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,339
Yeah!

120
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,469
-All right! Here we go!
-Oh! Yeah!

121
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,222
Most of the first round is finished,

122
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,350
and the only one left is
Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.

123
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,814
H-How about Naruto and
Neji's match...?!

124
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,275
Well, the interesting thing is...

125
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,988
That Hyuga lost...

126
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,623
Naruto beat Neji...

127
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,008
I see...

128
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,639
You did it!

129
00:09:58,974 --> 00:09:59,975
Naruto!

130
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,146
You're such a...
good guy really...

131
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,274
– What's going on with the next match!
– Let's get on with it!

132
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,942
Isn't Uchiha up yet?!

133
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,153
We want Uchiha! Uchiha!

134
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,321
Uchiha!

135
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,783
Hey, it's almost time.

136
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,827
Is he really gonna come?!

137
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,121
He'll come...

138
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,045
He'll definitely come!

139
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,679
Oh Sasuke, what's he doing!

140
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,308
What the heck is Uchiha doing?!

141
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,814
It seems the rumor that
he'd had a serious injury was true.

142
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,485
If there's a win by default,
then this match is mine.

143
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,074
Thirty more seconds...

144
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,535
Uchiha!

145
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,788
Uchiha!

146
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,713
Sasuke...please come!

147
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,423
Sasuke!

148
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,342
Hurry up and come!

149
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,677
It won't be good if it stays this way!

150
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,972
The time limit is up.

151
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,600
So this is it.

152
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,980
Because the time limit has expired,
the last match...

153
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,441
See... Here he is...

154
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,194
Well, I'm sorry we're late...

155
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,907
Sasu...

156
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,119
Your name?

157
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,459
Sasuke...Uchiha.

158
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,509
Sasuke...Uchiha.

159
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,928
Sasuke!

160
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,973
It looks like he made it in time.

161
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
Lee!

162
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,899
Darn... Causing others
this much trouble...

163
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,066
and thinking himself so important!

164
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,904
Huh! You're pretty late!

165
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,782
I thought you weren't coming
'cause you were scared to take me on!

166
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,119
Who the heck was it that
said he'd come for sure?

167
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,581
The first round...did you win?

168
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,707
Of course!

169
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,503
Don't get too carried away...

170
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,171
Loser!

171
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,265
Well, I know it's somewhat rude
to be showing up all flashy like this...

172
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,851
but was Sasuke...

173
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,270
disqualified?

174
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,653
So your habit of tardiness
rubbed off on him? Cripes...

175
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,113
And...what about it?

176
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,366
It's all right,

177
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,078
Sasuke's match
has been postponed anyway.

178
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,664
Your arrival was barely in time, but...

179
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,041
he hasn't been disqualified.

180
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,545
That's good to hear!

181
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,683
Don't lose to a guy like that!

182
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,518
Yeah...

183
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,401
I want to fight you too...

184
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,986
Sasuke!

185
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,865
I want...

186
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,868
to fight you too!

187
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,542
Yeah...

188
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,964
Yay, Sasuke!

189
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,299
Uchiha's match is gonna start!

190
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,343
Shikamaru gave it so much,
but already it's Sasuke...

191
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,012
Poor Shikamaru...

192
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,472
Hey, is that Uchiha?

193
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,518
I'm just second fiddle...

194
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,687
Well, I guess that's just
the way it goes...

195
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,273
I'm looking forward to it too.

196
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,486
Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.

197
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,571
What is?

198
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:09,284
Well, Naruto did beat that
Neji Hyuga and...

199
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,703
Sasuke is an elite member
of the Uchiha...

200
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,333
and it seems like everyone's
anxious to see Sasuke's match.

201
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:25,258
Sasuke will face that Gaara
of the Sand whom I couldn't beat...

202
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:31,056
And Naruto beat that Neji
that I had hoped to take down.

203
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,066
Why is it so...

204
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,655
Why am I so...

205
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,037
frustrated!

206
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,248
Lee...!

207
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,303
At last...

208
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,737
Gaara, come down here!

209
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,366
-Naruto! Let's go up!
-Yeah!

210
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,789
When we go up,
we'll leisurely take the stairs.

211
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,332
What's up with you!

212
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,584
Are you still upset that
I pushed you down?!

213
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,635
T-This isn't good...

214
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,263
It's been quite awhile
since I've seen Gaara like this.

215
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,890
H-Hey...Gaara.

216
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,226
Keep the strategy in mind...!

217
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,861
Don't talk to Gaara right now!

218
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,865
You'll be killed.

219
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,664
Right!

220
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,541
Let's go!

221
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,339
Hey, hurry up!

222
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,760
Nothing good's gonna happen
in your life if you panic.

223
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,888
What's wrong?

224
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,557
Huh?

225
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:55,492
Low-level tournaments like this
Chunin Examination are ideal

226
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,286
as gambling matches.

227
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,915
A number of feudal lords
are here for that purpose.

228
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,211
So...would you lose this match for us.

229
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,807
Hey, come on,
at least give us an answer.

230
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,271
Too scared to say anything...

231
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,981
H-Help!

232
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,610
S-Stop! Stop!

233
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,239
If those two in front of us
hadn't been there,

234
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,867
we probably would've been killed...

235
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,705
This is the first I've seen anyone
kill people without hesitation like that...

236
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,875
This isn't looking good
even for Sasuke.

237
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,711
Sasuke...

238
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,390
So now...at last...

239
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,815
Everyone makes mistakes

240
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:19,070
It's nothing to be ashamed about

241
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:24,325
Don't let this scar be for naught

242
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:30,039
Walk with a smile

243
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,969
Yes, breathe in the air

244
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,638
Lift your face to the sky and jump

245
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,558
If it rains, take a break

246
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,060
Go where the wind takes you

247
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,646
So many regrets

248
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,149
Don't let this scar be for naught

249
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,402
Let's go carve the badges
in our chest

250
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,195
Yes, it's Show Time,
life begins now.

251
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,492
Everyone makes mistakes

252
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:11,706
It's nothing to be ashamed about

253
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:17,003
Don't let this scar be for naught

254
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:22,258
Walk with a smile

255
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:27,555
Transform sadness into the wind

256
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:32,852
and continue to forge on

257
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:38,566
Forge on strong

258
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,622
Darn it!
What kind of guy is that?!

259
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,625
Gaara is totally not normal!

260
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,919
He doesn't even look at us.

261
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,213
If anyone fights with him like that...

262
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,924
Darn! Hey Shikamaru!
We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!

263
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,094
We've got to stop this fight,
no matter what!

264
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:11,307
Next time, "Bushy Brow's Jutsu:
Sasuke Style!"

265
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,811
If nothing's done,
Sasuke's a goner!
