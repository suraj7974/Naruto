1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,714
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,351
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,228
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,365
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,797
One more time

23
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,013
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!

24
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,358
There's nothing to worry about...

25
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,442
What?

26
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,698
Sasuke and I...

27
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,911
We didn't just get here late
for no reason.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,384
Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!
The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!

29
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,723
The third eye...

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,935
There is no doubt... That Jutsu is...!

31
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,813
Darn...Gaara...

32
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,901
Tora, Saru, Ne, Tatsu, Tori,
Inu, Ne...

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,573
Mi, Inu, Uma, Ushi, Tora, U, Tori...

34
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:40,452
Tatsu, Mi, Inu, Ne, Tora, Ushi, Saru...

35
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,207
Tatsu, Mi, Hitsuji, Saru...

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,419
Tori, Saru, I, Hitsuji, Uma...

37
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,171
Tatsu, Tora...

38
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,427
Tora, Saru, Ushi, Hitsuji, Ne, Uma...

39
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,556
Tora, Ushi, Ne, Tora, Tatsu...

40
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,310
Tori, Tatsu, Mi...

41
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,232
Hitsuji, Saru, Tori...

42
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:14,153
Tatsu, Tora, Hitsuji, Saru, Tori...

43
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,530
As I thought, it's no good.

44
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:21,285
I, Hitsuji, Uma, Tatsu, Tatsu,
Tatsu, Ushi, Ne...

45
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,080
Inu, I, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji, Uma...

46
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,167
Withdrawing like that...

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,670
I don't know what you're up to...

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,048
but the timing is perfect.

49
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,970
This thing of mine also takes time!

50
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,997
Hey, is something the matter?

51
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:08,999
No...

52
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,802
It must be my imagination...

53
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,012
Hurry up!

54
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,661
-Sensei...
-Hm?

55
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,873
What did you mean when you said
that you didn't get here late for nothing?

56
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,501
Hmm...

57
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,253
You want to know why?

58
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,464
Like I said, this isn't the time
to be talking about that!

59
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,717
Shut up and watch him.

60
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,183
'Cause you'll get a real surprise.

61
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,454
That idiot...

62
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:33,625
Gaara...we never know when
the signal is going to come!

63
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,255
Yeah...
I'm gonna tear him open.

64
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,718
That's how it comes out.
What?

65
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,345
The contents...

66
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,390
Lots and lots are coming out, right?

67
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,019
I'll give it all to you.

68
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,648
I'm always a good boy!

69
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,610
Yeah, let's do it.

70
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,822
Mother, I'm watching so...

71
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,788
Darn! He's totally useless,
no matter what we do now.

72
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,248
He's not even
abiding by the plan.

73
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,917
He looks like he's just going
to screw things up!

74
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,710
That Gaara!

75
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,299
Hey, hey, wouldn't it
be better if we flee...?

76
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,971
Plan...?

77
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,819
How's it going?

78
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,822
All preparations are proceeding
in accordance with the timeline.

79
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,826
Please hurry up with preparation
for Summoning.

80
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,370
I want to be sure we're able to
make our move at any time.

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,496
Understood!

82
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,541
All right, I'll leave that to you.

83
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,163
D-Don't tell me that...

84
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,375
The reason I decided to
train Sasuke was...

85
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,089
because he was like me.

86
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,024
A physical Activation?!

87
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,026
I see...

88
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,236
That's why he went through
the physical training

89
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,239
and increased his speed significantly...!

90
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,200
That's right!

91
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,998
Awesome...

92
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,958
The Chakra is clearly visible
to the naked eye...

93
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,294
What in the world is happening?!

94
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,714
Don't tell me that
he learned that Jutsu...!

95
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,843
So this is the Uchiha Clan...

96
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,977
Exactly...

97
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,939
W-What the heck is that?!

98
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,609
What a sound!
What's that technique?

99
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,486
That's just a jab...

100
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,029
Huh?!

101
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
However, it is the one used by
Leaf Village's number one technician.

102
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,912
That's the only original technique
of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi...

103
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,541
It's the special technique used
only for assassinations...

104
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,836
Its secret is in the speed of the jab,

105
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,506
and also the physical aptitude
that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,

106
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,009
the ability of the Chakra to
focus solely on the target,

107
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,472
and moreover the speed of
the jab makes a "chichichichichi" sound...

108
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,269
A unique sound attack similar
to the rumbling of a thousand birds.

109
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,864
And that's why that technique is called...

110
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,789
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

111
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,200
No way!

112
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,287
That Gaara's absolute protection is...

113
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,164
It's impossible...

114
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,666
Don't tell me...

115
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,046
Excellent work...

116
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,090
That's...

117
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,217
Kakashi's...

118
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,473
Chidori...
Also known as Lightning Blade.

119
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,975
Lightning Blade?

120
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,188
Lightning Blade is another name
for the Jutsu derived

121
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,608
from Kakashi's ability to cut through
lightning using that technique.

122
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,736
Huh? Cut through lightning?

123
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,907
Huh? That sounds fishy...

124
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,867
A-Awesome...

125
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,120
The real name of that technique
is Chidori...

126
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,501
The secret is the speed of his jab
that surpasses any human limitations

127
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,920
and the intensity of
the Chakra on his arm...

128
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,633
And that arm turns virtually
into the equivalent of the swing

129
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,927
of a celebrated sword that
cuts through everything.

130
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,723
But what a reckless technique...

131
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,725
That's not for you to say...

132
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,894
Right, Lee?

133
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,774
It's beyond my scope of
comprehension, but...

134
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,026
What an awesome technique!

135
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,448
I can understand it...

136
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,619
If it were me, if I made
a running start at that speed,

137
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,789
I wouldn't make a direct jab attack
on the opponent...

138
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,458
Or rather, I couldn't.

139
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,337
For an opponent,

140
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,631
a straight line attack just gives him
an easy chance to launch a counterblow.

141
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,637
And moreover, I don't have the eyes
to read that counterblow.

142
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,560
I envy you...Sasuke!

143
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,857
When I fought you once, I said...

144
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,484
Even if one understands visually,

145
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,820
it's meaningless unless
one can move physically...

146
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,406
I was filled with
a feeling of superiority.

147
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:25,370
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.

148
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,124
Moreover, you have...

149
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,711
the Sharingan!

150
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,672
I caught you!

151
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,220
Third Squadron.
We are ready any time.

152
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,057
All preparations are complete
on this end too.

153
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,769
Roger. Proceed with action
at the signal.

154
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,656
Looks like it's almost time.

155
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,834
The guy who was worrying about
Sasuke until just a moment ago...

156
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,298
is now jealous of him.

157
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,596
Sasuke...

158
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,017
This is the feeling!

159
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,189
Summoning Jutsu!

160
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,746
I've gotten stronger...

161
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,498
In order to become Hokage...

162
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,124
In order not to lose to anyone...

163
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,419
Sasuke!

164
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,338
In order not to lose to you.

165
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,553
I want...to fight you, too.

166
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,014
But you are...

167
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,017
Yeah...

168
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,748
What...? This warm thing...?

169
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,167
Mother...?

170
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,211
What is...?

171
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:54,477
Blood...my blood is...!

172
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,063
D-Don't tell me that...

173
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,162
D-Don't tell me that
Gaara is hurt?!

174
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
What is it?!

175
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,216
It's that thing's arm!

176
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,769
Darn! Doing something
careless like that...

177
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,734
Has the Perfect Possession happened?

178
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,404
I don't know.
He seems to be injured...

179
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,114
This has never happened before.

180
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,163
It gives me the chills
just to remember...

181
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,793
When I first saw that thing,
I wasn't able to eat...

182
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,297
I mean, visually it's totally...

183
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,841
What is...

184
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,176
this sensation?

185
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,884
He's hurt, after all...

186
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,095
The shell was broken when
his body was incomplete!

187
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,108
It's different! Those aren't the eyes!

188
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,570
W-What was that...
that look earlier on?!

189
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,960
What's this...?

190
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,796
I can't see...

191
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,298
Kakashi! This must be!

192
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,008
Yeah...a Genjutsu!

193
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,886
– Release!
– Release!

194
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,694
What's going on...?

195
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,071
Release!

196
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,909
Genjutsu!
Is Kabuto already moving?

197
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,037
In that case, it's just about time...

198
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,502
It's coming!

199
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,579
Shall we begin?!

200
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,177
It's the signal!

201
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,500
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!

202
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,770
Everyone makes mistakes

203
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:16,067
It's nothing to be ashamed about

204
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,322
Don't let this scar be for naught

205
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:26,995
Walk with a smile

206
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,715
Yes, breathe in the air

207
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,635
Lift your face to the sky and jump

208
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,303
If it rains, take a break

209
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,016
Go where the wind takes you

210
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,685
So many regrets

211
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,187
Don't let this scar be for naught

212
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,523
Let's go carve the badges in our chest

213
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,192
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

214
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:03,489
Everyone makes mistakes

215
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,745
It's nothing to be ashamed about

216
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:14,042
Don't let this scar be for naught

217
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,297
Walk with a smile

218
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,552
Transform sadness into the wind

219
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:29,807
and continue to forge on

220
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,646
Forge on strong

221
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,410
It got dark all of a sudden...

222
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,954
it feels so good.

223
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,915
I hear something in the distance.

224
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,124
Sakura's voice,

225
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,335
Kakashi Sensei's voice...

226
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,962
Scream? I just heard something loud.

227
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,423
I think I do, but...
Sasuke...

228
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,841
I got to watch his match!

229
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,929
But I really don't know
what's going on.

230
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,722
Next time: "Zero Hour!

231
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,057
The Destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!"

232
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,810
What in the world is going on?!
