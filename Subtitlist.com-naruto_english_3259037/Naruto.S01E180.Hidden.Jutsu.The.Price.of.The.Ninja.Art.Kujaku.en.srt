1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,554
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,743
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,495
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,999
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,420
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,329
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:49,610
♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?

17
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:54,698
Because I had a sad dream last night.

18
00:01:55,533 --> 00:02:01,330
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ♪

19
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:07,002
Swollen as I cried...

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,327
Hey!
Neji! Naruto!

21
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,164
What happened to those guys?

22
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,000
It seems they were attacked
by the Shinobi in question...

23
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,835
So he appeared again?

24
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,504
He took...he took Sumaru away.

25
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,174
What? He took Sumaru?!
Yeah!

26
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,887
Anyway, helping the guys who are
down comes first!

27
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,680
We'll split up and carry them!

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,391
Got it...
Roger!

29
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,358
Mizura...

30
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,531
Naruto!

31
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,577
They were attacked by
the Shinobi in the mask!

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,121
There are no external injuries...
They're just unconscious.

33
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,506
Umm... What about the others?

34
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,176
Lee and Tenten are carrying them
here now.

35
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,761
I see...

36
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,638
Then Sumaru as well...?

37
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,806
Oh... Uh...

38
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,725
He was taken away by
the masked Shinobi.

39
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,809
I'm sorry...

40
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,313
He escaped into the Valley of Death...

41
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,564
We couldn't go after him.

42
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
The Valley of Death?!

43
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,161
Did he inhale the gas from
the Valley of Death?

44
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,707
No... I put him into a state of
suspended animation beforehand,

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,125
so there was no effect on his body.

46
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,254
I understand using Sumaru
to lure that person...

47
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,049
But to use a child from our same village...

48
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,885
Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?

49
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,305
We're comrades who have
already dirtied our hands...

50
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,099
What're you doing talking nice now?!

51
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,435
We'll make those Hidden Leaf kids
believe that

52
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,231
Sumaru's kidnapping was
the work of that person...

53
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:37,695
After we've taken back the star,
we can leave the clean-up to them...

54
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,161
Hidden Jutsu:
The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku

55
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,128
Mizura isn't feeling well and
is taking a break from his training...

56
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:57,548
Byakugan!

57
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,638
What's this...?!

58
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,603
Mizura!

59
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,814
You okay?

60
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,190
You still need to rest...

61
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,235
I must not rest at a time like this...

62
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,573
I understand how you feel...

63
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,408
But you shouldn't push yourself too hard!

64
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,911
I'm fine... I can walk by myself...

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,552
Mizura! See, didn't I tell you?!

66
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,429
I'm okay by myself!

67
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,409
Mother... Father!

68
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,002
Mother! Father!

69
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,632
Do not cry... Sumaru...

70
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:27,596
Your parents protected the star
and protected the village admirably.

71
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,059
Sumaru... Look up at the sky and watch.

72
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,480
There is a treasure you can see only
in the Village Hidden in the Stars.

73
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,942
If you were born as a Shinobi,

74
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,862
for the sake of protecting this village,
for the sake of protecting the star,

75
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,322
become strong!

76
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,409
Like your father and your mother... Okay?

77
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,461
Lord...Hoshikage...

78
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,521
Yeah, this looks good!

79
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,278
Naruto...
Huh?

80
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,280
At this rate, Mizura will die!

81
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,327
I felt a Chakra disturbance
and looked into it.

82
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,956
Despite him lying quietly,

83
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,876
his Chakra was being activated
to the utmost limit.

84
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,130
If that keeps up, he'll be killed
by his own Chakra.

85
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,057
That could never be...!

86
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,435
There's no mistake...

87
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,811
But...!

88
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,646
It's because of the star training.

89
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,278
The star has the power
to activate Chakra.

90
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,658
However, many Shinobi are unable
to control the amplification,

91
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:15,204
their bodies break down
and it leads to death.

92
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,749
In the middle of this training,
Mizura also...

93
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,420
The Third Hoshikage terminated
training utilizing the star

94
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,714
due to the large amount of casualties.

95
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,300
Then why again?

96
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,719
Lord Akahoshi,
the current leader of the village,

97
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,640
decided to resume the training
half a year ago.

98
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,141
Something so dangerous!

99
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,476
We'll make him stop right now!

100
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,940
Those born and raised in this village
do not fear the star training!

101
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,608
Why would you...?

102
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,654
If they can complete the training
by themselves

103
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,114
and make every effort possible for
the village as a Hidden Star Shinobi...

104
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,285
Even if the body were to be destroyed,
they would be satisfied.

105
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,836
That's just...

106
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,647
Go!

107
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,279
Notice my Chakra... Natsuhi!

108
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:52,592
Hotarubi... Please protect the star,
protect Sumaru...

109
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,699
Akahoshi's Chakra...

110
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:49,024
Please use this until you get better...
I'm sure you will!

111
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,611
Thanks, Naruto...

112
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,577
But I won't...

113
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,550
It seems his condition has stabilized...

114
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,552
Everyone seems okay for the time being.

115
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,348
It still doesn't sit right with me...

116
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,811
Mizura and Hokuto, they're all thinking
earnestly of the village.

117
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,854
Especially that Sumaru guy.

118
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,107
He thinks of the village
more than anyone.

119
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,986
What do you mean...?

120
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,949
If it were for the sake
of protecting the village

121
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,784
and the special comrades around me...

122
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:46,748
I would've gotten impatient,
wanting to get strong quickly as well.

123
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,960
Yeah... That's right...

124
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,878
Yes...

125
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,632
Well, this isn't the time to
be saying stuff like that.

126
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,718
The unforgivable one is that star thief!

127
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:04,433
But, there wouldn't be any suffering
from training if they didn't use the star.

128
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,143
I think so, too.

129
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,606
If they have the star, everyone would train
for the sake of the village.

130
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,733
But if they do train,
then their bodies get...

131
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,987
Geez, I don't know what to do!

132
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:23,034
Our mission is to protect the star.
Our first priority is to get back the star.

133
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,954
We shouldn't be meddling in
the matters that follow!

134
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,497
That's right...

135
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,957
Okay.

136
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,667
Got it!

137
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,504
Lee and Tenten, you guys search
around the village chief once more!

138
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,672
What? Again?

139
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,552
Why did the flying Shinobi escape
to the dangerous Valley of Death?

140
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,970
Even though he got the star,

141
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,638
why did he go so far as
to take Sumaru away?

142
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,099
Come to think of it... Why is that?

143
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,145
The quality of Chakra of
the one who took the star

144
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,563
and the one who took Sumaru away
were completely different.

145
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,648
What?!
Say what?!

146
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,068
That's right...
There are two masked Shinobi!

147
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,279
What does that mean?

148
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,909
In my opinion, there's more to
this mission than meets the eye.

149
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:23,011
As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku,
Lady Natsuhi.

150
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,857
Where is he...? Where's Sumaru?!

151
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,277
Before that, I'll have you return
the star to me...

152
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,404
I'll trade it for Sumaru!

153
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,782
The star first!
I refuse!

154
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,244
Then I'll take it back by force
if I have to!

155
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,746
What's so funny?!

156
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,209
Akahoshi...
You're no competition to me.

157
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,503
Even after you left the village,

158
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,173
a few of us who were interested
continued training in secret!

159
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,468
You think you have completed
the star training

160
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,678
by training on your own?

161
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,807
Verify with your own eyes whether
or not I'm no competition!

162
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,977
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

163
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,436
Beast!

164
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,027
Such a folly... I have no choice.

165
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,072
Ninja Art: Kujaku... Beast!

166
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,412
Wha...?!

167
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,422
To think she'd be this tough...

168
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,925
Yotaka! Shisou!

169
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,095
– Go!
– Yes, sir!

170
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,807
What're you thinking, Akahoshi?!

171
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,979
I'll have you play along with me
a little while longer...Lady Natsuhi.

172
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,316
Huh? What is it?

173
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,694
A flow of massive Chakra...
Is it him?!

174
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,738
No mistake!

175
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,156
Oh?! Who is it?!

176
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,117
Our helper from the Leaf...

177
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,370
The Shinobi who seized the star
has appeared!

178
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,664
Lord Akahoshi is now delaying
that person...

179
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,333
Please fight with us!

180
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,877
All right! Let's hurry!

181
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,509
The enemy's power is mighty
and Lord Akahoshi alone cannot...

182
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,303
It's all he can do to delay the enemy.

183
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,805
Right. Leave it to us!

184
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,354
It seems nobody's here.

185
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,565
It seems they've gone out...

186
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,984
There's a faint presence
inside the residence.

187
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,029
Now's our chance. Let's infiltrate!

188
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,948
Right!
Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!

189
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,867
What?! Lee?

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,661
Since when could you use Ninjutsu...?

191
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,207
Tenten! It's okay. There's nobody in here!

192
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,251
Hey, that's not Ninjutsu!

193
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,970
Kind of...
Suspicious, eh?

194
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,400
Yikes!

195
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,901
Uh...uh, oh...

196
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,621
Well... I guess I can do it later.

197
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,508
It seems to be a medical room...

198
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,845
Somebody's being laid down in a bed.
I wonder who it is?

199
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,890
That's...!

200
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,810
Sumaru!

201
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,611
Why did you make Sumaru and
the others do that star training?

202
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,365
You should've been told by
the Third Hoshikage

203
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,325
about how dangerous that training is!

204
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,788
You yourself...are the answer to that!

205
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,251
What?!
That Chakra is wonderful!

206
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,211
It would make for great fighting strength

207
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,256
if we had one hundred, no,
even ten Shinobi like you!

208
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,176
The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages
would be no match for us

209
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,469
even if they all ganged up on us!

210
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,679
It's still not too late.

211
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,433
Let's make this village into
an invincible Hidden Star Village!

212
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,607
It hurts... It hurts...

213
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,985
My body feels like it is on fire!
Help me...

214
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,654
I must train... Star training...

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,159
– That's enough... That's enough.
– For the sake of Hidden Star Village...

216
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,328
There's no need to do
such painful training!

217
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,792
That sorrow must not be repeated...

218
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,337
If you're saying you're going to
continue this any further...!

219
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,680
W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!

220
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,186
You can't do it! Natsuhi!

221
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,856
Sumaru, who is more important
than your life, is in my hands!

222
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,203
There he is!
He's moving in on Akahoshi!

223
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,206
All right!
I won't let him get away this time.

224
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,042
Wait! He's not an opponent
you can take on from the front.

225
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,295
I've got a plan.
A plan...?

226
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,007
I'll stop his Chakra,
so I leave the rest to you!

227
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,886
Indeed, the situation will get worse
if we're too slow.

228
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,306
Got it! Be careful, Naruto!

229
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,724
All right! Let's go!

230
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,644
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

231
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,482
– Let's go!
– Let's go!

232
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:10,942
You again?!

233
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,039
It's more than I imagined.

234
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,584
It's impossible from the front, after all.

235
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,546
What?!

236
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,506
Where's the real body?!

237
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,426
Oh, no!

238
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,887
I get it.

239
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,014
When controlling massive Chakra,

240
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,434
less attention is paid to the area around
the main body in spite of everything...

241
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,977
Good thinking, Naruto!

242
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,064
He... He did it...

243
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,244
A woman...?!

244
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,667
The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it...

245
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,837
I can find the star if I take the time...

246
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,924
But now's my only chance
to defeat Natsuhi!

247
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:20,887
As long as she interferes, I won't be able
to carry out my ambitions!

248
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,015
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

249
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,350
Beast!

250
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,269
Naruto! Look out!

251
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,023
Shoot!

252
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,401
Naruto!

253
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,789
Something the matter, Mizura...?

254
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,999
No... It's nothing...

255
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,169
Naruto...

256
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,839
Mother...

257
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:16,567
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

258
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,700
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

259
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,548
Yellow Moon.

260
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:45,513
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

261
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:50,768
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

262
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:57,567
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

263
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:04,532
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

264
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:11,330
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

265
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:18,087
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

266
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:25,011
A magical chord change, in a restless city

267
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,976
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

268
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,651
Everybody, I just realized
something important!

269
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:41,736
What is it all of the sudden?

270
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,946
Sumaru was being captured
by Akahoshi!

271
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,366
Which means that the culprit who attacked
everyone was Akahoshi!

272
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,202
And?
Believe it or not!

273
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,622
One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.

274
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,582
Neji said that long time ago, remember?

275
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,793
Excellent, Neji.
You are a sharp one!

276
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,294
Can we move on?

277
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time:
"Hoshikage: The Buried Truth"
