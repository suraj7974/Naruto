1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,979
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,356
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,736
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,531
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:35,870
For no single one,

7
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,498
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:45,004
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,383
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,135
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,220
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,308
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,768
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,728
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,987
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,203
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,584
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,254
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,053
You have to think when using Jutsu.

21
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,514
They can be used against you.

22
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:43,604
Also, don't get caught
in an obvious trap, you fool.

23
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,359
A Ninja must see
through deception...got it?

24
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,529
I know that!

25
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,157
You know, you say that because
you don't get it. Listen up.

26
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,495
Your movements are wasteful.

27
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,789
Now!

28
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,836
He finally dropped his guard!

29
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,921
You're so...

30
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,093
No way!

31
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,762
You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.

32
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,900
Damn! Another substitution...?

33
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,987
He must have found out my location
with those Shuriken!

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,949
He purposely lowered his guard!
Serves me right...

35
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,784
I fell for the trap.

36
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,744
So he's over there, eh...

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,083
Sasuke...Where are you...?!

38
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,544
Don't tell me,
Kakashi Sensei already...

39
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,296
No!

40
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,840
That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!

41
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,678
Safe! He didn't notice me.

42
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,638
Sakura, behind you.

43
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,931
Huh?!

44
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,398
What's up with that "A Ninja must see
through deception" stuff?!

45
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,235
Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!

46
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,578
I fell for it again!

47
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,665
You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision

48
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,649
What was that?! Huh?!

49
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,651
Hold on! Where's Sensei?!

50
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,402
Huh?! What's going on?!

51
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,196
Huh?! What's what?!

52
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,156
Sakura...

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,991
Sasuke?!

54
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,203
Sa...Saku...ra...

55
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,747
P-Please...help...me...

56
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,760
Maybe I went a bit overboard...

57
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,389
But it's really something
she should notice...

58
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,350
Was that voice...Sakura's...?

59
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,021
Shinobi Battle Skill #2, Genjutsu.

60
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,316
Sakura was easily lured.

61
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,568
Genjutsu, huh...?

62
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:40,948
An illusory mind-controlling technique.
I'm not surprised she got lured.

63
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,074
However...

64
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,911
I'm different from them.

65
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:53,627
Why don't you say that after
you get a bell...Sasuke?

66
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,532
It's no use just using
straightforward attacks.

67
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,911
A trap?!

68
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,249
What?!

69
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,597
This guy's...?!

70
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,605
What a guy.

71
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,024
There's no time
to read "Make-Out Paradise."

72
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,655
What...?
I...?!

73
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:10,746
That's right! I saw Sasuke on
the verge of dying and I...

74
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,500
Sasuke!
Don't die and leave me here!!

75
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,543
Where are you?!

76
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,054
So that's what it looks like
behind the logs.

77
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,602
Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!

78
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,607
A Ninja must see through deception...eh?

79
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,948
Well! I'll acknowledge that
you're different from those two.

80
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,868
Horse!

81
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,495
Tiger!

82
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,456
Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,210
What?! That's not a Jutsu
that a Genin can do...

84
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,671
He shouldn't have
enough Chakra yet!

85
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,897
He's gone!
Is he behind me?! No, above me?!

86
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,566
Where is he?!

87
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,025
I'm under you!!

88
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,863
Wha...?!

89
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,365
Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.

90
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,751
Shinobi Battle Skill #3, Ninjutsu.

91
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,921
How's that? You can't move, heh?

92
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:49,761
Although, you're...already starting
to make your mark.

93
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,805
But, oh well.

94
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,018
They do say that the nail that sticks up
gets hammered down, so...

95
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,730
Damn it!

96
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't have to naively take those bells.
I'll just eat in secret right now!

97
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
Let's eat!!

98
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,909
Hey.

99
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,871
I was just joking...

100
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,164
Too late!

101
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,710
Darn it...! Is there this much of
a difference in strength...?

102
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,263
Sakura...

103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,726
This time it's a freshly severed head?!

104
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,523
What's up with her?

105
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,617
Sasuke?

106
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,079
-You're okay!
-Hey, cut it out! Don't cling to me!

107
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,795
There's not much time left until noon.
I'm going.

108
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,590
Sasuke, you're still going
after the bells?!

109
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,718
I was able to touch them last time.
Next time I'll be able to take them.

110
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,097
What?!
I-I see.

111
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,933
Sure enough,
you're awesome, Sasuke.

112
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,521
There's no way I can take
the bells from Sensei.

113
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,692
At this rate, I'll face
separation from Sasuke...

114
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,364
Uh...say. There's really no time left...

115
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,617
So let's just take it easy and
try again next time.

116
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:03,228
I'm the only one
who can kill that man.

117
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:11,695
Huh...? What?
You mean Sensei?

118
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,157
At that time...I was crying.

119
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,743
Crying...?

120
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,495
My...

121
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,499
What...? What is it...?

122
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:30,464
I'm an avenger. I must become stronger
than that man...

123
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,633
I don't have time for setbacks here...

124
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,266
...to kill a certain man!

125
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,563
Damn it...I wasted my time talking.

126
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,566
Sasuke...

127
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:02,037
Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling...

128
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,415
By the way, about this exercise...

129
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:10,170
Well! There's no need for you guys
to go back to the Academy.

130
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:16,468
What? I... All I did was lay unconscious.

131
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,011
Is that okay?

132
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,348
Love is victorious!! Cha!!

133
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,768
Yahooooo!

134
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,437
Then, then!
That means the three of us...

135
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,190
Yes. The three of you...

136
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,026
must quit being Ninja!!

137
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,163
N-No way!

138
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,917
Kakashi hasn't passed
a single person this whole time...

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,544
Iruka...

140
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:57,384
Even I don't know if it's good for
those kids to become Shinobi right away...

141
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:02,055
However...
Kakashi's judgments were correct...

142
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,435
Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!

143
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,604
Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to
take the bells.

144
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,066
But why do we have to be told to "quit"?!

145
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,029
That's because you're all squirts who
don't have the qualifications to become Ninja.

146
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,369
-Oh!
-Sasuke!

147
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,873
I'm saying you're squirts.

148
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,793
Don't step on Sasuke!!

149
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,759
Are you kids thinking that
being a Ninja is easy? Huh?

150
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:47,726
Why do you think you're doing
this exercise in teams?

151
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,936
Huh?! What do you mean?

152
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,771
Put simply...

153
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,650
it's as if you guys have no
understanding of the answer to this test.

154
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,652
Answer...?

155
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:02,365
Yes. The answer that determines
passing or failing of this test.

156
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,328
That's...what I've wanted to ask
about for a while now.

157
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,832
Man, are you guys brainless or what?

158
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,544
Don't you get the meaning of
the three-man squad?!

159
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:19,341
Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!

160
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,052
That's...teamwork!

161
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,847
You mean, working together?

162
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:30,143
Exactly. But it's too late even
if you realize that now.

163
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,062
You might've been able to...

164
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,314
take the bells if the three of you
had come at me...

165
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,025
Well, it's too bad.

166
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,027
Now wait a minute.

167
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,822
Why use teamwork if
there were only two bells?

168
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,743
If the three of us were to desperately go
take the bells with one having to hold back,

169
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,037
that wouldn't be teamwork.
That'd create internal discord.

170
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,789
Of course!

171
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,501
This is a test set up to purposely
place you against each other.

172
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,965
It's under just such conditions
where one's own interests aren't the issue.

173
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:05,303
The intention was to select those
who could prioritize teamwork...

174
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,056
Despite this, you fools...

175
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,224
Sakura!

176
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,812
You were only concerned with Sasuke and
you didn't even know where he was.

177
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,439
And you didn't care for Naruto who was
right in front of your eyes...

178
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,275
Naruto!

179
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,944
All you do is run solo...

180
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:27,158
You labeled the other two as hindrances
and acted on your own...

181
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,703
Missions are carried out in squads!

182
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,998
There's no mistaking that Ninjas need
unsurpassed individual skills...

183
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,043
But "teamwork" is considered
more important than that.

184
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:43,049
Individual actions that disrupt teamwork
throw the team into crisis and lead to death...

185
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,634
For example...

186
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,181
"Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies..."

187
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,851
What?! What?! Whaaat?!

188
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,937
Is what will...happen.

189
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,026
Oh, I was so surpised.

190
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,321
On top of having a hostage taken,

191
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,115
you're faced with two impossible choices
and end up being killed.

192
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,494
Every mission is
a life-risking assignment.

193
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,416
Look at this...

194
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,461
The many names engraved
on this stone...

195
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,507
These are all Ninjas who are called
heroes in the village.

196
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,220
That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!

197
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,849
I've decided now to get
my name engraved there, too!

198
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,687
A hero! A hero!
I'm not going to die like a dog!

199
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,149
But...they're not just ordinary heroes.

200
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:45,403
No kidding. Then, what kind
of heroes are they?

201
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,699
Hey! Hey!

202
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,618
They are heroes
who were killed in action.

203
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,621
Killed in action?

204
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,832
It means they died
performing a mission.

205
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,468
This is a memorial.

206
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,764
The names of my friends
are also engraved here...

207
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,364
I'll give you guys one more chance!

208
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,576
However, after noon it'll be
a harsher battle to take the bell.

209
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,995
Those who want to take on
the challenge can eat lunch.

210
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,540
However, don't let Naruto have any.

211
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,837
It's punishment for breaking the rules and
attempting to eat lunch on your own.

212
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,881
If someone lets him eat...

213
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,217
that person will be disqualified
on the spot.

214
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:57,142
I make the rules, here. Got it?!

215
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,603
I must be going.

216
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,605
Listen to me, Iruka.

217
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,399
What?

218
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,653
No matter what the result,
don't hold it against Kakashi...

219
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,323
Alright.

220
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:31,468
I'm okay with not eating lunch!
No sweat at all!

221
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,679
No sweat...

222
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060
Here.

223
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:47,066
H-Hey, Sasuke.
Sensei just said...!

224
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,737
It's okay.
There's no sign of him now.

225
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,782
The three of us are going to go
take the bells together.

226
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,660
It'll be trouble for me
if he becomes a hindrance, so...

227
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,954
Sasuke...

228
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,467
Sakura...

229
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,559
Thanks...

230
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,896
Don't thank me.
Just hurry up and eat.

231
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,731
But...

232
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:31,152
I'm on...a diet...
I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.

233
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,154
So you don't need to worry.

234
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,156
But...

235
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,367
See...

236
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,576
Wha...?!

237
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,579
Hurry it up.
We don't know when he'll be back...

238
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,666
It's just this one time.

239
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,836
Okay? You got it?!

240
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,046
I got it.

241
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,473
You three!

242
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,350
Yiiikes!

243
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:09,482
You defied the rules so that
means you know what's coming...

244
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,323
Do you have...something to say?

245
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,705
But you see...

246
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,039
What?!

247
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,502
But! But! But!
You said, Sensei!

248
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,170
These guys...

249
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,173
We're a three-man squad, right?

250
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,887
That's right!
The three of us are one, so...!

251
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
That's right! That's right!
That's right!

252
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,475
That's right!

253
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,729
The three of you are one, eh...

254
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,237
You pass!

255
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,448
-What?!
-Whaaat?!

256
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,243
You pass!

257
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,372
We passed?! Why?!

258
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,334
You guys are the first.

259
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:14,339
Up until now, it was always just dunces
who would meekly listen to what I said.

260
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,010
A Ninja must see through deception...

261
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,720
In the world of Ninja,

262
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,265
those who break rules and codes
are branded as garbage...

263
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,600
But...

264
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,022
Those who don't cherish their friends are
garbage worse than that.

265
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,658
He's... He's...kinda...cool...

266
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,285
That's it for the exercise...

267
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,912
Everyone passes!

268
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,998
Group Seven starts their mission
tomorrow!

269
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,959
Yes, Sir!

270
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,590
I did it!! I'm a Ninja!
Ninja! Ninja!

271
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,717
Let's go home.

272
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,766
Cha!

273
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,726
I...

274
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,438
knew this is how it'd turn out!

275
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,986
Untie the rope!

276
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,708
Oh, please! It'd been nothing but
blah missions until now.

277
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,251
And just when I thought I'd finally
gotten an awesome mission,

278
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,045
to think it'd be bodyguarding
this old man.

279
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,507
He mocks the heck out of me,
calling me a brat.

280
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,550
I'll tell him a thing or two.

281
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:10,264
Someday I'll be...
Hey, are you listening?!

282
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:14,477
Next episode: "A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!"

283
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,479
Don't miss me kick butt!
