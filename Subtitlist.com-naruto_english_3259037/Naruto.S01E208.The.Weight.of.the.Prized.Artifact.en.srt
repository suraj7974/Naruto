1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,882
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,414
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,217
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,224
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,315
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,780
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:17,077
into your hands

12
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:22,958
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,426
More to the right!

15
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,511
The Weight of the Prized Artifact!

16
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,554
Okay! Okay!

17
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,519
There it is! That's it!

18
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,854
But...

19
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,149
A teacup like this a treasure, huh...?

20
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,445
A delivery mission?

21
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,198
No, it's delivery protection
to be exact.

22
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,700
There's a higher risk of danger
than a regular delivery.

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,580
The Beauty of Nature is a treasure
of national importance so to speak.

24
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,793
In monetary value, you could buy
one or two mountains with its value.

25
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,294
For real...?

26
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:10,339
I'd like you to deliver it safely
to Kale Avenue

27
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,341
where it will be put on exhibition.

28
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,014
At any rate, what's with
that humongous safe...?

29
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,267
You're late.

30
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,435
Kiba...

31
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,397
Lady Tsunade told me to come
as pursuit personnel

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
just in case something happens
to the delivery item...

33
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,528
Have you heard anything else?

34
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,614
Nothing special other than
it's an incredible treasure...

35
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,162
No Trespassing
Hey, you with the stupid look.

36
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:44,999
Huh?

37
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:50,379
Can't you see
the "no trespassing" sign, huh?!

38
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:56,010
No, we came here on a delivery mission
from Lady Tsunade for that thing.

39
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,722
That's right!
Here's the paperwork.

40
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:00,806
Huh...?

41
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,767
Look out.
It's going to fall!

42
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,816
Run, Naruto!

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,903
Hey, what're you doing, bro?

44
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,322
Hm? What're you doing?!
Stop it, quickly!

45
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,619
You came on a mission, didn't you?!
Get to work, you idiots!

46
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,703
H-Hey!

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,124
Even if you die, don't knock it over!

48
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,505
All right!

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,929
All right!

50
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:41,805
That was close...

51
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,935
S-So what should we do with this, bro?

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,561
Die.

53
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,980
You jerk...

54
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,242
As for you brother, what kind
of person are you?!

55
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,079
We were just about to die!

56
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,455
Huh?

57
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,334
Ninja are supposed to risk their lives
on a commissioned mission, right?

58
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,045
Just a minute, buddy!

59
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,838
I'm not your buddy!

60
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,592
I'm your client on this mission, Shinemon.

61
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,012
Come on...
Get a move on if you're not dead.

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,142
Akamaru, Fang over Fang!

63
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,604
No, I'll pound him
with my Rasengan!

64
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,273
Don't get so serious!

65
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,236
Hey! What's the deal?!
Are you guys not fired up?!

66
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,822
Jeez. Getting all
uselessly carried away.

67
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,282
You'll get no sympathy
if you get all tired later on!

68
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,161
This here is not like you guys, this here!

69
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,130
So you got too carried away
and dropped it?

70
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,970
I'm so sorry!

71
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,141
Jeez... Well, we've got the time,

72
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,560
so I guess all we can do
is go down and get it.

73
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,023
No... It seems we don't
have that much time.

74
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,149
Huh?

75
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,783
Wh-What do we do, Kiba?!

76
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,578
If we took the roundabout way,
we'd never make it in time!

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,621
All right!

78
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,291
All right?
What're you going to do, buddy?!

79
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,210
Let's bungee jump!

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
Why me...?!

81
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,179
Die like you just don't care!
I'll pick up your bones for you!

82
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,520
I did it!

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,397
No way?!

84
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,237
That was a close one.

85
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,948
Idiot! Naruto, behind you, behind you!

86
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,409
Huh? What?

87
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,503
No way!

88
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,518
That was a close one...

89
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,520
Y-You...

90
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,023
You got a problem? Huh?

91
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,485
A Ninja expects to lose his life
on a mission, right?!

92
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,948
Buddy, you want to try dying once...?

93
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,076
Don't stop me, Kiba!

94
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,204
I'll pound him no matter what
with my Rasengan!

95
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,248
S-Stop it! Calm down, Naruto!

96
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,917
I'm really sorry!

97
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,479
Hey, act more natural.

98
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,689
You idiot...

99
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,774
I am acting natural,
no matter how you look at it...!

100
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,484
No way... Totally unnatural...

101
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,904
Just a minute, you guys.

102
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,285
Jeez...

103
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,371
It seems there's something
very valuable in there...

104
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,499
If you like,
we could carry it for you instead.

105
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,002
Now... Hand it over here.

106
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,712
We'll carry it for you with care.

107
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,921
N-No...

108
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,008
It's not really anything valuable.

109
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,177
I mean, how should I put it...right?

110
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,266
That's right. It's not like that at all.
Right, buddy?

111
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,519
What're you guys talking about?!
It's extremely valuable.

112
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:01,899
Have you forgotten that there's
a national treasure-class relic inside?!

113
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,483
It's the Beauty of Nature!

114
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,737
It's the Beauty of Nature
more valuable than human life!

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,072
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!

116
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,825
Wh-What're you saying?!

117
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,785
Hey, buddy, do you understand
the situation?!

118
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,121
Shut up! Situation?
You gotta be kidding!

119
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:20,209
I absolutely won't forgive anyone
who insults the Beauty of Nature!

120
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,795
So... A treasure more valuable
than life, huh...?

121
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,924
Then you won't have a problem
with being killed, right?

122
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:34,056
Oh, sorry... I must be going
as I've got cram school today.

123
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,021
Run!

124
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,023
–Hey, hold it!
–Hey, hold it!

125
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,778
I'll take care of things here.
You escape with Shinemon, Kiba!

126
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,488
Right! Come on!

127
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,500
Others have popped up!

128
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,502
What're you doing escaping with me?!

129
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,380
Do something quickly, you idiot!

130
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,590
Jeez, what a jerk...!

131
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,260
You go on ahead!

132
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,222
Okay... Let's go, Akamaru!

133
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,192
A battle has started again, huh?

134
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,237
Yes. A battle has started again.

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,447
It's a sad thing.

136
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,783
Yes. It's a sad thing.

137
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,454
H-Hey!

138
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,587
You're late, you idiots.

139
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,340
I'll get you, no matter what!

140
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,843
Akamaru, Fang Over Fang!
Fang Over Fang!

141
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,762
I-It's a joke, man! A joke!

142
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,285
At last we've nailed down the location
of the treasured Beauty of Nature...

143
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,051
Something coming!

144
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,598
Buddy, you stay right here!

145
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,099
R-Right...!

146
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,103
Stop hiding and come on out!

147
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,903
A smoke screen.
That's a good idea...!

148
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,072
What're you doing
getting impressed, you idiot?!

149
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,406
Do something, quickly!

150
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,075
We know!

151
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,036
Let's go, Kiba!
Yeah!

152
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,788
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

153
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,125
Now, let's tear it up, Akamaru!

154
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,339
Since our vision has been sealed,
we'll just use scent!

155
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,091
Let's show them, Akamaru!

156
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,803
Where are you hiding?!

157
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,811
The Beauty of Nature is mine.

158
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,187
Oh no!

159
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,606
Let's go, Akamaru!

160
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,566
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:

161
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,027
Man Beast Clone!

162
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,406
Fang Over Fang!

163
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,913
Then...we'll do this! Akamaru!

164
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,875
Dynamic Marking!

165
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,588
Whoa! What's this?!

166
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,507
Buddy, what's the matter?!

167
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,050
S-Something's salty!

168
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,427
I'm coming!

169
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,013
Naruto, where are you?!

170
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,807
Get over here now, you idiot!

171
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,270
You're late, Naruto!

172
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,537
You okay, buddy?

173
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,748
Naruto...

174
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:37,340
Spraying piss?!
I'll pound you guys for sure!

175
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,719
Taking back the treasure comes first!

176
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,637
That's right!

177
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,975
Oh man! I knew I should've
taken charge of it!

178
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,936
If we trace the scent of
Akamaru's Dynamic Marking,

179
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,563
it should work out, but...

180
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,610
I see, Akamaru...
They're still not far?

181
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,070
All right, let's go!

182
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,411
We did it... We finally did it!

183
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,334
-What're you doing?
-Shut up!

184
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,796
They came to take this back!
Let's get out of here!

185
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,049
You won't get away!

186
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,509
Hold it!

187
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,136
Impertinent! Go!

188
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,474
We'll handle things here.

189
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,435
So you go after him!

190
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,229
–Right!
–Let's go, Kiba!

191
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,563
Right!

192
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,942
Hold it!

193
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,452
You won't get away, you jerk!

194
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,288
It ends here! See you later!

195
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,012
Let's hurry!

196
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,848
I won't hand it over...!

197
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,100
Let go!

198
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,648
Boy, I was going to let you
slide by with your life, but...

199
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,155
Give it back...

200
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:29,619
The Beauty of Nature...
Give it back...!

201
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,214
Haven't you
misunderstood something?

202
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,425
You'll let me off with my life?

203
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,136
That Beauty of Nature...

204
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:51,933
is a super first-rate treasure
more precious than human life...

205
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:57,939
The question of my life
was never of a concern!

206
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,859
Don't make light of me! Got that?!

207
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,115
You okay, buddy?!

208
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,171
Jeez, you Genin are really useless.

209
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,883
You're all beaten up yourself, buddy!

210
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,302
Y-You jerk!

211
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,640
Damn it! I'll put an end
to things here at once!

212
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,857
Everything's over!

213
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,485
We'll be in a fix
if we don't hurry, Naruto!

214
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,612
Let's get a move on, brother!

215
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,742
Buddy!

216
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,828
Quick! Take the Beauty of Nature
to a safe location.

217
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,414
No way, what're you saying?!

218
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,000
You'll get crushed if you don't hurry.

219
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,252
Wh-What're you guys looking at?!

220
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,463
Take the Beauty of Nature while you can...

221
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,798
What're you saying?!

222
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,801
Hurry!

223
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,188
Buddy! You okay?!

224
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,530
Oh! The Beauty of Nature!

225
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,704
Don't move, buddy!
Gently, hold out your hand!

226
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,587
Idiot, what're you doing?!

227
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,506
Just hurry up and come this way!

228
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,676
You guys are the idiots!
Forget about me.

229
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,177
If you're Ninja,
do something about

230
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,221
the Beauty of Nature
rather than my life!

231
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,434
Naruto, let's just forget
about this guy!

232
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,061
He should just die like
a dog on his own!

233
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,563
Let's hurry and get out of here!

234
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,732
Yeah, do as you like!

235
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,503
The Beauty of Nature...

236
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,467
Brother!

237
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,269
Am I...going to die...?

238
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,025
We were just about to die!

239
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,401
Huh?

240
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,904
Ninja are supposed to
risk their lives

241
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,322
on a commissioned mission, right?

242
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,284
Come on...
Get a move on if you're not dead.

243
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,417
It's the Beauty of Nature!

244
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,670
It's the Beauty of Nature,
more valuable than human life!

245
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,589
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!

246
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,133
I'm gonna...just like this...

247
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,099
Haven't you misunderstood something?

248
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,435
You'll let me off with my life?

249
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,021
That Beauty of Nature...

250
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,777
is a super first-rate treasure
more precious than human life...

251
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:36,366
The question of my life
was never a concern!

252
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,703
Heck no...

253
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,708
I don't want to die!

254
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,015
There's nothing in this world
more valuable than life!

255
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,331
Nice...bungee jump...

256
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,304
Now then, what shall I do now?

257
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,889
Y-Yeah...

258
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,975
Sure enough...
without the treasure...

259
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:50,690
Don't mope like that.
That's why you guys are useless.

260
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,611
But there's no point without
the treasure after all!

261
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,322
Huh? If there isn't one,
then I just have to make one.

262
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,909
Make...? You say that
like it's easy, but...

263
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,416
That's a picture of you, buddy.

264
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,960
The creator of the dauntless artifact...

265
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,005
Beauty of Nature ...
Shinemon, the living national treasure?

266
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,591
So basically...?

267
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:22,513
That means you made
the Beauty of Nature, buddy?!

268
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:26,142
But, you're...the client...

269
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,644
You got a problem

270
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,147
with the client being the creator
and a living national treasure?

271
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,858
But no matter how you look at it...

272
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,112
This here's not like you guys!
This here!

273
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,323
Well, you know...

274
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,077
It means my life rather than
the treasure was the correct answer.

275
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,873
You do pretty good work for Genin.

276
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,041
Thanks for the help.

277
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,585
Now then, I guess I'll hurry

278
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,546
and make a masterpiece to
exceed the Beauty of Nature!

279
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,186
The Key to the rusted heart's door

280
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:16,192
Will always be smiling right near by

281
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,619
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

282
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

283
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,878
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

284
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:40,550
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

285
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,596
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

286
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,018
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

287
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:54,397
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

288
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

289
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,992
The wind is probably testing our hearts

290
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,705
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

291
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,376
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

292
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,173
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

293
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,761
The Key to the rusted heart's door

294
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:31,392
Will always be smiling right near by

295
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,360
Your mission is to take that Ninja Dropout
we caught all the way to the capital.

296
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,820
What's a Ninja Dropout?

297
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,489
It's a gang of thieves consisting
of Rogue Ninja,

298
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,783
who don't consider themselves
Shinobi anymore.

299
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,702
I can't forgive them for using
their Shinobi powers for evil.

300
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,537
So, well, you can figure out
the rest by now.

301
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,247
In other words, there is a possibility

302
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,999
that they will come to save one of their own.

303
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,209
Exactly.

304
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,796
You are assigned to the mission
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!

305
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,880
Roger!

306
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,965
Next time:
"The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts"
