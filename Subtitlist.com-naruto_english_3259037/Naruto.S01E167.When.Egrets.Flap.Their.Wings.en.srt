1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and
gather the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long
way to go on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards
the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,361
There was something beyond
that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,823
What's this? Where does this water...?

16
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,569
What's the matter, Naruto?!

17
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,280
Get a hold of yourself, please!

18
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,247
Naruto!

19
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,000
They all look like they're having fun.

20
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,752
Naruto!

21
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,589
Naruto...

22
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,760
Hey, you jerk...

23
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,859
This is...that lake from before...

24
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,571
Naruto...

25
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,698
I see...

26
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,619
The person who was calling my name
earlier was you, right, Chishima?

27
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,289
Are you hurt?

28
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,665
I should be asking you that, Chishima.

29
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,167
You shouldn't be moving
with that injury.

30
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,502
I'm fine.

31
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,880
More importantly,
we need to find Lady Toki.

32
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh yeah, that's right...

33
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,051
Where the hell did that Moso go?

34
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,262
I'm right here...

35
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,682
Moso...!
Lady Toki...!

36
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:49,521
Chishima, I'm sorry for having
deceived you for so long...

37
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,360
That's all right, I already had
a sense that maybe...

38
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,863
You guys know too many
of this land's secrets...

39
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:02,618
I'll have you guys embrace those secrets
as you plunge headfirst into hell...

40
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,004
Is that your real face?

41
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,173
My name is Hoki.

42
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,883
I'm a Wandering Ninja.

43
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,553
I'm not about to let you get in
the way of my taking this peaceful land,

44
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,681
which I have finally managed to snatch!

45
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,976
Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!

46
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,129
Chishima!

47
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,214
Chishima!

48
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,053
Please, hang in there!

49
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,765
Are you...all right?

50
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,686
I'm so relieved...
Chishima!

51
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,732
Lady Toki... I have fond memories...

52
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,319
of playing here at this lake...

53
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,156
with you and Lord Sagi.

54
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,869
In those days,

55
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,206
the Land of Bird was tranquil,
gentle and warm...

56
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:37,212
Use your strength, Lady Toki...
to restore the Land of Birds...

57
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,424
to the way it was in those days...

58
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,260
Chishima...

59
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,971
Hang in there!

60
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,433
Naruto, I beg you...

61
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,852
help Lady Toki...

62
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,855
help my friend...

63
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,192
Sure thing.
If a Leaf Ninja promises something,

64
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,278
he will complete it to the very end.

65
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,031
Promise me...

66
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:10,245
You must...
you must... protect Lady Toki...

67
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,750
You have feelings for her, don't you?

68
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,463
That ramen...was delicious...

69
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,674
I'll treat you to some again...

70
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:29,139
Thank you... Naruto...

71
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,646
Chishima!

72
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,113
Chishima!

73
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,077
Chishima...!

74
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,664
That guy was nothing more

75
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,376
than just another
convenient servant, after all.

76
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,627
Shut up!

77
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,048
He loved the Land of Birds
with all his might...

78
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,553
Chishima, who staked his life trying
to protect the country he loved...

79
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:14,852
I will not...forgive you,
no matter what!

80
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,189
You may say that
you won't forgive me,

81
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,651
but what exactly do
you think you can do?!

82
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,530
Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!

83
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,998
Die!

84
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,268
How annoyingly persistent!

85
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,988
Gentle Fist!

86
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,708
That was careless,
Copy Ninja Kakashi Hatake...

87
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,170
The reputation of the Wandering Ninja
will be upgraded

88
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,423
if I take you, who possess
the Sharingan, down...

89
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,058
What...? A Substitution...

90
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,144
Sorry to disappoint you.

91
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,980
I don't need to use the Sharingan
on the likes of you...

92
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,863
This way!
Naruto!

93
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,538
If we follow this...
Yes, we should be able
to reach Naruto.

94
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,468
Unfortunately, I cannot allow you
to avenge the blood of the fallen.

95
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,679
The least I can do for you,
out of charity,

96
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,181
is send you to the same place
your father and brother are.

97
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,351
I don't care.

98
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,063
Why don't you just kill me
in one stroke?

99
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,816
You know when to give up, huh?

100
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,447
They're all dead.
I'm the only one left in this world.

101
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,494
Now that I am unable to take revenge,

102
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,038
I have no more reason to live.

103
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,291
You're a courageous girl,
aren't you?

104
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,004
All right, I'll grant your wish.

105
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,464
Resign yourself!

106
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,021
Wake up.

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,947
Save Toki... Save my little sister...

108
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,410
I entrusted the future of
the Land of Birds to my younger sister

109
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,953
and gave her the watch.

110
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,416
But Toki became obsessed
with her desire for revenge.

111
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,253
I, a dead soul, cannot change
my younger sister's heart

112
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,130
which is stalled in time.

113
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,299
I'm begging you,

114
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:37,137
please make my younger sister's time
begin to move again towards the future.

115
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,017
What was that just now?

116
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,191
Die!

117
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,029
What?

118
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,407
Hold it!

119
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,250
What?

120
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,337
Hold it!

121
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,306
Naruto!

122
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,978
I met your elder brother in
a dream a little while ago.

123
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,271
Elder Brother?

124
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,401
It wasn't the wish of
your elder brother Sagi

125
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,735
that you avenge his death.

126
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,697
He wanted to leave the care
of this land in your hands.

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,576
But...
For Chishima's sake too...

128
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,162
you must make this
Land of Bird a great country...

129
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,376
That's why you must live, Toki...

130
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,336
Naruto...

131
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,300
It doesn't make any difference to me.

132
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,095
The two of you are going
to die here in any case.

133
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,316
Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?

134
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,026
What...

135
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,781
But a person with an impure heart,
with a heart bent on revenge,

136
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,074
cannot govern this land.

137
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,912
The reason this was such
a wonderful country was because

138
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:30,750
Chishima and Sagi and Toki's hearts
were all connected.

139
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,795
Even if you use dirty tricks
to gain status,

140
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,007
you will never be able to control
the hearts of the people...

141
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,425
Speak for yourself, squirt!

142
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,304
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

143
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,063
You Leaf Village greenhorn!

144
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,942
I'll send you down into hell first
to meet up with the others!

145
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,529
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

146
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,204
– It ain't gonna be that easy!
– It ain't gonna be that easy!

147
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,541
– Then try to spot the real McCoy!
– Then try to spot the real McCoy!

148
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,210
What...!

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,128
Let's go!

150
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,151
– Damn, which is the real one?
– Damn, which is the real one?

151
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,084
Naruto, hang in there...

152
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,047
I wouldn't have thought the real McCoy
would come straight out

153
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,340
when using Shadow Clones...

154
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,385
I was hoping you'd let me
have some fun...

155
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,804
So that was your caliber,
after all, huh.

156
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,934
Those without power should
hurry up and die!

157
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,565
Better not underestimate me!
The battle is not yet won!

158
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,153
You impertinent little...!

159
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,533
Now!

160
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,995
U-zu-ma-ki...

161
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,041
The real McCoy is... Over here!
Uzumaki Barrage!

162
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,844
I did it!
Chishima!

163
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,852
Chishima... Don't die, Chishima!

164
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,399
Don't...leave me...all alone!

165
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,918
Open your eyes...

166
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,421
Please!

167
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,025
Lady Toki...

168
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,903
Chishima...!

169
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,697
Lady Toki...

170
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,662
I'm so relieved!

171
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,623
Thank you, Naruto!

172
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,876
I was just carrying out my mission.

173
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,252
More importantly...

174
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,299
Make that guy pay dearly for
his crimes, okay.

175
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,968
Yes.

176
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,263
I'm sure that Sagi is happy
about this too.

177
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,267
You met...you met Elder Brother Sagi...

178
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,354
Yeah, in a dream.

179
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,272
But even if it was in a dream,

180
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,233
it doesn't change the fact that
he asked me to do something.

181
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,194
What did Elder Brother say to you?

182
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,907
Well, he said something about
starting up your time again.

183
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,951
My time?

184
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,829
He said he wanted you to forget
about things like revenge

185
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,373
and instead live for the future.

186
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,297
Elder Brother...

187
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,299
Hey!

188
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,760
Naruto...

189
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,222
Kakashi Sensei, Neji, Tenten!

190
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,112
Gimme a break...
I can't get paid my extra money
now that Moso,

191
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,531
the guy who signs the paycheck,
got nabbed...

192
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,658
Come on, resign yourself...
But...

193
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,662
It looks like the Wandering Ninja
are going to get a really stiff sentence.

194
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,292
Yeah... And Toki was finally able to
break the curse of seeking revenge...

195
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,377
Hey, it's gonna start!

196
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,173
Down on your knees!

197
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,807
Ohhh...wow...

198
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,111
I must apologize for having
deceived everyone

199
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,821
by using my brother's name fraudulently,

200
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,741
and claiming
the title of feudal lord.

201
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,076
In a case such as this,

202
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,247
it may well be proper to hand over
the title of feudal lord to someone else.

203
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,876
However, if you will forgive me,

204
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,628
I would like to ask you to
allow me to work

205
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,421
on behalf of Land of Birds
as your lord.

206
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,383
For my deceased father Owashi,
and brother Sagi...

207
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:18,765
And for my dear friend Chishima
who loves this country so dearly...

208
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,891
Lady Toki...

209
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,061
As long as there is breath in my body,

210
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,355
I would like to work positively
to rebuild this country.

211
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,899
She's doing an excellent job, isn't she?

212
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,567
Toki, awesome!

213
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,071
As you wish, Lady Toki...

214
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,533
It appears that
you all agree too, correct?

215
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,952
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

216
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,247
Thank you...

217
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,459
To Komei...for accepting me
as your feudal lord...to everyone...

218
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,754
And to the young Ninja who taught me

219
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,300
what it is that I should really
stake my life on...

220
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,094
You're embarrassing me...

221
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,431
Land of Birds

222
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,560
Please take the best of care
along the road now.

223
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,644
Fare thee well.

224
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,856
Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?

225
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,108
Thank you, Naruto.

226
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,570
Please come back to visit
again soon.

227
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,240
Sure, next time I'd love
to visit without a mission.

228
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,578
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Be well...

229
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,704
See you...

230
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,840
Toki...she was really kind
and gorgeous too, wasn't she?

231
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,134
I'm certain that the Land of Birds
will become a wonderful land again,

232
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,136
just like it was in the old days.
Yeah.

233
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,890
By the way, Naruto...
did you really meet Sagi's ghost?

234
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,100
You gotta be kidding.

235
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,812
There's no such things as ghosts...
that was all in a dream.

236
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,690
I'm not so sure it was just a dream.

237
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,026
Wh-What the heck are you
talking about?!

238
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,739
Do you remember that Cursed Warrior
we cornered the very first time?

239
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,699
Uh, yeah.

240
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,993
Yeah, he was empty inside.

241
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,631
Th-This...?

242
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,469
The inside of it is empty.

243
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,222
Yeah, but that was just sort
of gimmick, right?

244
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,599
Some kind of string or piece
of wire or something...

245
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,186
No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.

246
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,730
Now that you mention it,

247
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,524
you said there was no sign of life,
right, Neji?

248
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:38,655
Yeah...I didn't feel a speck of life
from that Cursed Warrior.

249
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,448
In other words, there was
a ghost there.

250
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,662
So that was a real ghost, after all?!

251
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,622
Calm down, Naruto.

252
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,957
That's not true...
That's not true!

253
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,212
Tell me that's not true!

254
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,197
The wind blows, Ah...

255
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,659
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

256
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,537
What should be brought along?

257
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,165
Assemble them into a piece.

258
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,378
There is no second chance, never

259
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,380
How foolish it is to throw away

260
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,299
Acting so innocently, Ah...

261
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,343
The images.

262
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,100
It probably will not end

263
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,939
It probably will not end

264
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,111
Burn that love-filled heart,

265
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,364
Sail across a thousand dreams

266
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,242
Running freely

267
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,829
To take hold of the world in hand

268
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,041
The clouds scatter

269
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,127
The sun sets yet again

270
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,925
The solo parade begins to move.

271
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,345
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

272
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,766
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

273
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,274
– Pork!
– Chicken!

274
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,609
– Beef!
– What, is this a guessing game?

275
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,902
– Bean sprouts!
– Spinach!

276
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,028
– Green onions!
– I got it! It's Stir-fried Beef & Vegetables!

277
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,112
– Egg!
– Nori!

278
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,197
Seaweed!

279
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,865
Umm...Stir-fried Beef, vegetable,
and seaweed in egg sauté?!

280
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:46,824
– Menma!
– Char-siu!

281
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,826
Naruto!
I got it, ramen! It's ramen, isn't it?!

282
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,036
Wrong answer!

283
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,162
Sakura, you're so slow to get it!

284
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,872
You should know
if we've said it this far.

285
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,625
Miso-tonkotsu ramen with char-siu
and eggs on top.

286
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,834
Isn't that right?!

287
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,628
Like heck I'd get it, Cha!

288
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,881
Next time:
"Mix It! Stretch it! Boil it up!
Burn Copper Pot! Burn!"
