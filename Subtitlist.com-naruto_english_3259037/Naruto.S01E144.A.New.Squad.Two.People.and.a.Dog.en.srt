1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:15,683
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,904
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,837
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,420
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,387
– Sumptuous meal!
– Sumptuous meal!

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,808
I feel a little thrown off balance.

22
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,102
Let's regroup, everybody!

23
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,896
Go!

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,989
I'm itchy, Elder Brother.

25
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,742
Yeah, itchy...
Huh?!

26
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,421
My punches aren't having
any effect whatsoever.

27
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,304
Naruto...

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,765
This doesn't look good.

29
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,850
Again!

30
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,774
Huh?

31
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,038
I-It itches, Elder Brother.

32
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,500
Yeah...feels like I'm getting a rash.

33
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,003
D-Damn!

34
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,847
I'm not done yet!

35
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,309
Stop it, Naruto!
It's futile...

36
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,520
– You won't swagger like that for long!
– You won't swagger like that for long!

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,326
This feels so good!

38
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,373
What's up with those guys anyway?

39
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,752
You're an idiot brat as always.

40
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,504
You have it hard, don't you?

41
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,965
Having to go on a mission
with that failure of a brat.

42
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,718
Don't you, Iruka?

43
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,929
Why, Mizuki?!

44
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,309
I'm asking you, please stop
this kind of foolishness!

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,436
Are you intending to betray
your comrades from the village again?

46
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,982
Comrades?
That's right!

47
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,192
Your comrades from the Leaf Village

48
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,069
with whom you shared
both pleasures and pain!

49
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,320
You can understand that, can't you?

50
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,697
Comrades...huh?

51
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,920
As usual, you are naïve, aren't you...Iruka?

52
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,715
What I believe in is power!

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,679
Don't think you can shackle me with
such vague bonds like that of comrades!

54
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,305
Mizuki...

55
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,600
I will soon get my hands
on the ultimate power!

56
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,936
Lord Orochimaru's power!

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,150
Orochimaru?!

58
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,903
Then I'll teach you a lesson!

59
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,239
About how meaningless it is...

60
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,117
that thing you and the other Leaf guys
describe as camaraderie or whatever!

61
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,785
Mizuki...

62
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,622
You were an excellent Shinobi despite
having committed that crime, you...

63
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,749
Don't talk so knowingly!

64
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,635
Damn! They're dodging all my attacks!

65
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:07,057
Iruka, if you insist so much,
why don't you show me?

66
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,729
What degree of feeling
you really have for your comrades...

67
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,191
I wonder whether you'll really
be able to stop me?

68
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,444
Come!
Wait!

69
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,656
Naruto! Forget about these guys!
Pursue Mizuki!

70
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,743
Damn...!

71
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,788
I'm gonna settle this later without fail!

72
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,046
Elder Brother, that guy went off.

73
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,382
They all went off, didn't they?

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,887
Elder Brother, could this be
a game of hide-and-go-seek?

75
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,181
Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek!

76
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,851
So does that mean we're "It"?

77
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,773
Those jerks!

78
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,984
Making us "It" without even deciding
by scissors-paper-rock!

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,612
– Let's go, Raijin!
– Okay!

80
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,323
A New Squad! Two People and a Dog?!

81
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,620
Over here...Iruka.

82
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,292
Hurry, Naruto!

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,044
Don't be fooled this time!

84
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,798
Shut up! It's 100 years too soon
to be arguing with me!

85
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,508
I'm telling you,

86
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,761
if you dilly-dally the situation's gonna
get really troublesome again!

87
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,096
What?!

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,890
Found you!

89
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,357
Good job, huh, Elder Brother!
Yeah!

90
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:43,320
I don't have time to be
dealing with these guys!

91
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,449
Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun,
but aren't you getting hungry?

92
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,203
You're really something,
aren't you, Raijin?

93
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,708
Leave some for your Elder Brother!

94
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,627
Of course, I will!

95
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,963
Hey, you idiot brothers!

96
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,047
– Huh?
– Huh?

97
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,716
This is no time to be eating!

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,554
I'm telling you, it's foolhardy
to be fighting these guys!

99
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,765
I already know that!

100
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,771
Mizuki! Where are you?!

101
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,650
What's the matter...Iruka?

102
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,112
Weren't you gonna stop me?

103
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,828
Stop this foolishness, Mizuki!

104
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,290
Come on out, Mizuki!

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,890
Always be aware of an attack from behind...

106
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,350
For a Shinobi, isn't that a basic rule?

107
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,367
Nicely done, Iruka.

108
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,831
Pretty good!

109
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,084
Always read behind the surface
of your enemy's bluffs...

110
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,379
For a Shinobi isn't that a basic rule?

111
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,841
That's my line!

112
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,932
What's that?
A Smoke Bomb?

113
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,059
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

114
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,606
– Come on over! Catch us if you can!
– Come on over! Catch us if you can!

115
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,983
Elder Brother, they're increasing!
They're increasing!

116
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,070
Raijin, this must be
super hide-and-go-seek, don't you think?

117
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,113
Yeah. That's right!

118
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,034
A decoy strategy, huh?
You thought it through.

119
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,162
We can buy some time this way.

120
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,538
All right, now's our chance...

121
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,999
– Super, super hide-and-go-seek!
– Super, super hide-and-go-seek!

122
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,443
There are,
there are two Old Lady Tsunades!

123
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,487
You're talking about
the idiotic strength, huh?

124
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,826
Haven't you come to your senses yet?!

125
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,952
Shut up!

126
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,124
Why are you so obsessed with power!

127
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,459
Because that, if anything, is everything!

128
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,297
Reconsider, Mizuki! It isn't too late yet!

129
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,258
You are naive!

130
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,592
Don't you understand the situation?!

131
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,225
What's the matter?
Come on and attack, Iruka!

132
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,311
You're not my enemy!

133
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,687
You're my comrade from the same village!

134
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,398
I told you, I'm tired of that kind of
song and dance!

135
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:10,360
And moreover... you're my colleagu!

136
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,823
You're a member of the same family
that inherited the same Will of Fire!

137
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,326
Will of Fire, huh?

138
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,910
Yes, that's right.

139
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,080
Therefore, please stop
the foolishness, Mizuki!

140
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,958
It irks me most when
you say things like that!

141
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,335
Mizuki!

142
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,881
Since we're old acquaintances
I was gonna kill you quickly.

143
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,257
But now I've decided against that.

144
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,926
You're gonna have some fun...

145
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
I'll give you a taste of how it feels

146
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,556
to be killed slowly by
your so-called comrade!

147
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,695
Hey, Naruto... How long are you
planning to be like that?

148
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,199
It's just a matter of time till
those guys find you!

149
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,871
I found you!

150
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,873
What?! They found us!

151
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,085
All right! This is it!

152
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,462
Hide-and-go-seek!
Hide-and-go-seek!

153
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,547
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

154
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,470
Elder Brother,
super hide-and-go-seek again?

155
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,472
I'm getting bored with this.

156
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,477
Shadow Clone again?!

157
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,105
As always, you have no new tricks, huh!

158
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,440
Just leave it to me!

159
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,691
All right! Go!

160
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,819
– Okay!
– Go!

161
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,655
Wh-What?!

162
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,865
What kind of game is this?

163
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,539
Wow, they're going so fast.

164
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,500
I see... Not bad.

165
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,421
I-I feel sick... Elder Brother.

166
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,214
I'm woozy...

167
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,924
Now! Catch them!

168
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,095
Huh?!

169
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,515
You jerks...

170
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,434
What do you think you're doing?

171
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,437
The preparation's done!

172
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,898
Here it goes!
You fatso Herculean brothers!

173
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,994
Concentrate... I must concentrate...

174
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,629
Stop putting on airs!

175
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,673
A guy like you, who's weaker than me!

176
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah! That's right, isn't it?!

177
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,430
You always excelled over
anything I did, didn't you...?

178
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,225
I was always being helped by you,
wasn't I?

179
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,272
One year has passed already, hasn't it?

180
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,445
It's not so easy to laugh,
hiding your sadness.

181
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:04,326
Your teacher told me that
you are the center of the laughter.

182
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,245
I'm not sad at all!

183
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,915
It's an honor for Shinobi
to die during their missions!

184
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,334
My dad and mom...

185
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,922
are heroes who protected this village
from the Demon Fox!

186
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,341
And I am the child of those heroes.

187
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,511
That's why I'm not sad
even though I'm alone...

188
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,556
These tears are from the happiness...

189
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,099
Enough already.

190
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:35,857
I'm always aware that
you are feeling lonely.

191
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,445
But you are not alone.

192
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,118
All of Leaf's Shinobi
have the "Will of Fire."

193
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,371
"Will of Fire"?

194
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,124
It means the will to protect the Leaf.

195
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,878
As long as you have the Will of Fire,

196
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,840
you and people in this village
are all family.

197
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,262
Iruka, I wonder if you have that.

198
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,767
Yeah.

199
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,149
Huh...?

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,905
Who's that over there?

201
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,249
Mizuki...

202
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,293
What are you doing there?

203
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:41,172
Well, I heard that Iruka
was depressed these days...

204
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,759
I was worried and came to look for him.

205
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,680
Everybody's...worried about you, Iruka.

206
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,350
Everybody's waiting over there.
Come on and play with us!

207
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,065
It's all right... Go on.

208
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,664
The Mizuki that I idolized was kind...

209
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,710
And he was a guy who was more
thoughtful of his friends than anyone else.

210
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,128
Yet...

211
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,715
Please remember! Mizuki!

212
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,177
You really are...

213
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,638
an idiot, aren't you?!

214
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,061
L-Let go...

215
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,981
Here it goes...
S-Stop please!

216
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,652
I-I feel sick...

217
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,785
– Huh?
– Eh?

218
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,745
What?

219
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,459
Elder Brother, don't tell me that you...

220
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,672
Sorry, Raijin... I squashed...

221
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,132
our lunch!

222
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,634
What?!

223
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:20,355
Stay still, guys! Now take this...!

224
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,525
– Give us back our lunch!
– Give us back our lunch!

225
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,651
What?!

226
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,451
H-He's done it, huh...

227
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,506
It doesn't look like you understand me,
so let me explain.

228
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,760
The real reason I was kind to you...

229
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,347
Because it made me happy
more than anything

230
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,307
to see you in your misery!

231
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,898
Hey, Iruka!

232
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,193
We're gonna go play soccer right now.

233
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,529
Come join us, Iruka!

234
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,032
Sure! Okay!

235
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,577
I wonder if Iruka's okay

236
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,371
after all those things
that happened to him...

237
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,582
That's why we need to try to cheer him up!

238
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,544
Why...only him...

239
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,675
Everybody makes a fuss about him

240
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,927
just because of his parents
getting killed by Nine-Tail...

241
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,389
Serves you right...

242
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,061
Even Lord Hokage?!

243
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,611
Why...why is it?!

244
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,491
Who is it over there?

245
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,621
All right...

246
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,791
I'm gonna try to gain the favor
of Lord Hokage too...

247
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,251
sWhat are you doing over there?

248
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:09,714
Well, I heard that Iruka has been
depressed recently so...

249
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,675
You're lying!

250
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,677
Treating a guy who's weaker
than oneself with disdain

251
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,847
is the most pleasurable
feeling of all, Iruka.

252
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,559
You weren't that way in the past!

253
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,604
That's why I've been telling you...
you're naïve!

254
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,733
That kind of naiveté leads to fatal mistakes
on the battleground.

255
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,279
On the battleground, it's all about
how many enemies you can kill!

256
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,201
If you throw a Kunai blindly
in a bamboo grove,

257
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,287
all that will happen is that it'll bounce off
and its path will be errant.

258
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,081
If you're gonna take aim...
make it straight!

259
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,300
Don't think I'm gonna get fooled twice
with the same bait!

260
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,346
Damn... I'm at a disadvantage if
we fight in a place like this!

261
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,355
Mizuki...

262
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,526
You...

263
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,363
Mizuki!

264
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,616
I told you, it's useless...

265
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,208
If the path is going to be errant,

266
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,044
then one just needs to calculate
the path of the Kunai when throwing it!

267
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,216
So you've finally gotten serious, huh?

268
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,926
Follow me!

269
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,477
Where is this?

270
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,858
Looks like you're finally conscious.

271
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,819
You jerk...

272
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,364
You ruined our meal...

273
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,159
Don't even think
we're gonna let you leave here alive!

274
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm going for his stomach!

275
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,959
I'm going for his head!

276
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,922
– One, two...
– One, two...

277
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,174
– Three!
– Three!

278
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,592
Huh?
Huh?!

279
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,524
Wh-What is going on?

280
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,487
Gimme a break, what are you doing?!

281
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,157
Wh-Who's that?

282
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,623
It's too much of a drag
to tell you my name, however...!

283
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,085
The most powerful support squad
assigned to this mission!

284
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,297
The most powerful trio from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

285
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,800
We're Ino-Shika-Cho!

286
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:19,320
Crappy news pass us by

287
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,532
And you become speechless

288
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,579
My voice is way too soft

289
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,874
So you don't answer

290
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,547
You're crying Crying alone

291
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,635
What can I do? I'm crying too

292
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,929
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

293
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:50,560
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

294
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,313
Yeah

295
00:21:54,397 --> 00:22:00,111
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

296
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,698
Yeah

297
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:09,495
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

298
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,999
Yeah

299
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:18,921
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

300
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:25,219
Yeah

301
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,985
What's with these guys?!
They have super ridiculous strength!

302
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,154
To think they can resist

303
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,697
Shadow Possession Jutsu
to this extent on sheer power!

304
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,325
If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now,
we'll be in a hairy spot!

305
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,161
Our only choice is to
settle this right away.

306
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,996
Are you guys ready?

307
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,289
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

308
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,959
Then let's go! This is our trump card!

309
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:01,380
Next episode,
"A New Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!"
