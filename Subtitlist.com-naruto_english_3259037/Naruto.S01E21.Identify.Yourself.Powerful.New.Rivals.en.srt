1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:16,267
<=title>

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,936
Running like a fugitive,

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

5
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

6
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,698
My throat dry like it's withering

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,036
For no single one,

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,498
To none does belong,

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,171
This time is ours, right now...

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,008
Unraveling the pain,

11
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,885
Unraveling our hearts,

12
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

13
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,807
Stifling our breath,

14
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,601
Reaching for beyond,

15
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

16
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:09,695
In fighting and in love

17
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

18
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:16,827
Yes, we are on the way

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:22,917
I wanna rock...

20
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,921
Rockin' my heart

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,931
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,810
Why do you think we came all
the way here to Leaf Village?

23
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,937
P-Please listen to me, Gaara.

24
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,565
T-They lashed out first...

25
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,025
Shut up!

26
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,196
I'll kill you.

27
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,241
U-Understood, I was wrong.

28
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,160
I-I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry.

29
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,705
I'm sorry about that...

30
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,085
This guy...has a nasty look.

31
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,879
To think he was able to hit
that Kankuro

32
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,965
with a tiny rock with great ease.

33
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,592
This guy's...good.

34
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,516
Let's go.

35
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,143
We didn't come here
to play around.

36
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,520
I know.

37
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,438
Hold it!

38
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,649
What is it?

39
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,401
Judging from your headbands,

40
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,570
you're Ninjas from the Village
Hidden in the Sand, right?

41
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,825
Without question, the Land of Fire and
the Land of Wind are allied nations.

42
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,660
But the arbitrary coming and
going of Shinobi

43
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,453
is supposed to
be prohibited by the treaty.

44
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,539
State your purpose!

45
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,874
Depending on circumstances...

46
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,334
Hmph! So this is what they mean

47
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,878
by the darkest place being
under the candlestick.

48
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,504
Don't you know anything about it?

49
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,965
My permit!

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,971
As you say, we're Sand Village Genins
from the Land of Wind.

51
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,641
We came to this village to
take the Chunin Exam.

52
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,228
Chunin Exam...?

53
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,691
Identify Yourself:
Powerful New Rivals

54
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,946
What is the Chunin Exam anyways?

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,949
You really don't know
anything, do you?

56
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:24,622
Bro, if you pass the exam,
you can become a Chunin from a Genin!

57
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,666
I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,084
Heh!

59
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,087
Hey! You there...

60
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,631
What's your name?

61
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,591
Huh? M-Me?

62
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,594
No! The gourd next to you!

63
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,307
I'm Gaara of the desert...

64
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,851
I have an interest in you as well...

65
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,478
What's your name?

66
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,481
Sasuke Uchiha.

67
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,907
Say! Say! What about me?
What about me?

68
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,867
Not interested.

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,374
Heh! Things have gotten interesting.

70
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,920
Konohamaru, do I look weak?

71
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,798
Compared to Sasuke, yes...

72
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,718
Sasuke, I won't lose to you!

73
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,261
What's gotten into you,
all of a sudden?!

74
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,180
What do you think?

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,266
I don't think they're anything special.

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,061
But the black-haired one from Leaf Village
and the gourd from the Sand Village...

77
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,896
those two need to be checked.

78
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:37,903
Now then, in conjunction
with beginning the Chunin Exam,

79
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:42,157
let us first have those in charge
of the rookie Genin come forward.

80
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,162
Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma...

81
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,791
So? Are there any Genin from
your squads

82
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,628
you wish to recommend
for these exams?

83
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,631
It goes without saying,

84
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:02,261
but if it's a Genin who has carried out
eight or more formal missions,

85
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,597
you can recommend them
for the exams if you wish.

86
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,891
Well, as a general rule,

87
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:12,438
having carried out more than twice
that amount of missions is appropriate.

88
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,106
There's no need to hear this...

89
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,983
It's too soon for them.

90
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,028
Then, you first Kakashi.

91
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,114
The Kakashi-led Group Seven...

92
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,535
Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.
Sakura Haruno.

93
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:33,625
I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these
three for the Chunin Exam.

94
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,379
The Kurenai-led Group Eight...

95
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,884
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,
Shino Aburame.

96
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,971
These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,
recommend the same.

97
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,349
The Asuma-led Group Ten...

98
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,979
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,
Choji Akimichi.

99
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,901
These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,
recommend the same.

100
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,195
All three recommended...

101
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,905
To think rookies will be
in the Chunin Exam...

102
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,114
Hasn't it been five years
since that's happened?

103
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,534
Wait a minute!

104
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,453
What is it, Iruka?

105
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,039
Lord Hokage, please let me
say one thing.

106
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,874
This may be presumptuous,

107
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,460
but as for the nine names
that were given,

108
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,004
I was in charge of them at the Academy.

109
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,132
Admittedly, they were all students
with ability,

110
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,300
but it's too soon...!

111
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,471
They should be tested after
having gained more experience!

112
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,976
I became a Chunin when I was
six years younger than Naruto is now.

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,937
Naruto is different from you!

114
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,273
Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!

115
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,443
They always do nothing but complain
about important missions...

116
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,613
Teaching them a lesson
once would be fun.

117
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,116
Trying to crush them
would be interesting, too.

118
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,826
W-What did you say?!

119
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,287
Well, joking aside...

120
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,206
Iruka Sensei...

121
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,668
I understand what you want to say.

122
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,170
It's aggravating, I know.
However...

123
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,505
Kakashi...

124
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,714
Don't do it.

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,053
Stay out of this!
They're not your students anymore!

126
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,722
Now they're my subordinates!

127
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,894
Man...troublesome people.

128
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,694
B-But the Chunin Exam
is also known as...

129
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,653
Iruka...

130
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,490
I understand your point.

131
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,534
Master Hokage...

132
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,745
Therefore, I have decided to conduct

133
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,957
a special preliminary exam
for these rookie Genins.

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,459
P-Preliminary exam...?!

135
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,888
Say! Say! Say!

136
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,890
Why is it that he's the one who
always calls us out,

137
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,516
and then makes us wait?!

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,059
That's right! That's right!

139
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,644
What's he going to do about
the feelings of a maiden

140
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,939
who accidentally overslept and resigned
herself to no blow-drying?!

141
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,068
I overslept, so I haven't washed my face
and didn't brush my teeth.

142
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,531
Y-You...That's dirty.

143
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:13,994
Why're these guys so hyper
first thing in the morning?!

144
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,498
Hey, good morning, folks!

145
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,336
Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life...

146
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,879
Right! That's a lie!!

147
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,423
Uh, well...

148
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,928
This is sudden, but I recommended
you guys for the Chunin Exam, so...

149
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,180
Here, these are your applications.

150
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,890
Chunin Exam...

151
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,352
That being said, the recommendations
are not compulsory.

152
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,189
You guys are free to decide whether
you take the Exam or not.

153
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,733
All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!

154
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,735
Hey, cut it out. Get away already...

155
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,697
Only those who want to take the Exam,
sign that application and

156
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:55,535
come to Room 301 of the Academy
at 3:00 p.m. five days from now...

157
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,703
That's it!

158
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,041
Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!

159
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,965
Chunin Exams, eh...

160
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,885
I bet lots of strong guys would be there...

161
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,221
For example, that guy!

162
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,808
And this guy!

163
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,317
Okaaay! I won't lose to
anybody no matter what!

164
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:32,948
If I take the first place, the path to
the Hokage is right there!

165
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,160
Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto
will be the Hokage...

166
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,663
I'll just retire my elderly self at once.

167
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,789
Yaaaay!

168
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,003
I might be able to fight him.

169
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,846
I...don't want to...

170
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,057
Here I can't...

171
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,393
keep up with Sasuke,
and not even with Naruto...

172
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,312
The Chunin Exam, no way...

173
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,963
Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!

174
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,426
Sure. I don't have any missions today,
so I'll play with you guys!

175
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,969
Yaaay!

176
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,846
Oh!

177
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,355
Leader! Konohamaru!

178
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,482
What're you going to do with Moegi?!

179
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,650
Hey, you! Let Moegi go!

180
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,573
Darn!
Let's follow them, Konohamaru!

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,408
-Y-Yeah!
-W-Wait!

182
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,923
Chunin Exams, eh...

183
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,549
Yo.

184
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,552
S-Sasuke, what's up?

185
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,055
How about we go for a little walk?

186
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,974
No way! For real?!

187
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,980
Well well... So you can keep up
at this speed, eh?

188
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,067
Wait for me! Moegi!

189
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,323
Bro, where'd you go?

190
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,325
I think we are lost.

191
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,786
Nooo! Let me go!

192
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,374
Even the strongly fortified
Village Hidden in the Leaf...

193
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,877
is mine if I slip in the
middle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.

194
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,256
That was fast...

195
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,675
Hey! You fat old man!

196
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,718
What're you going to do with Moegi?

197
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,804
What am I going to do, you ask?

198
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,640
You want to know?

199
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,599
Wha...?!

200
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,767
Don't move!

201
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,602
If you do,
the brat's dead meat!

202
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:11,565
Y-You. Why're you doing this?!

203
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,942
I want the first Hokage's
Scroll of Sealing!

204
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,027
If you bring it to me,
I'll return the brat!

205
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,989
Scroll of Sealing...

206
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,033
Umm...

207
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,869
Sasuke...

208
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,912
What's up, all of a sudden?

209
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,622
Sakura...

210
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,252
Give up on the Chunin Exam...
It's too early for you.

211
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,671
Is it...?

212
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,797
I thought so...

213
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,842
The Chunin Exam is
a gathering of top dogs...

214
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,179
You might die if you're not careful...

215
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,097
Sasuke...

216
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,641
So you're worried about me, right?

217
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,768
Yeah...kind of...

218
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,355
What a display of affection, eh?

219
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,608
Get lost! If you don't want to die.

220
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,568
Don't talk as if you know everything!

221
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,489
Don't make me angry!

222
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,698
Sasuke!

223
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,285
Don't take me lightly!

224
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,208
Sasuke!

225
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,097
Sasuke?

226
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,099
Sasuke!

227
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,434
Sasuke!!

228
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,023
What're you doing?

229
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,025
Hurry up and bring me
the Scroll of Sealing!

230
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,529
What'll happen...if I say, heck no?

231
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,198
You don't care what happens
to this brat?

232
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,577
Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens
to that bunch of straw, I say.

233
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,955
Wha...?!
When did he do that?!

234
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,085
I've taken Moegi back from you,
thank you!

235
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,088
As expected great leader!
Moegi respects you.

236
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,715
Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh...?

237
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,510
You don't know when to give up!

238
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,266
Naruto!

239
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,351
Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!

240
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,145
Konohamaru, I was scared.

241
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,648
Oh, there-there...

242
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,358
Leader, did you catch him?

243
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,321
Yup, as you can see! Huh? What?!

244
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,032
Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!

245
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,076
Dang it! When did he switch?!

246
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,911
I see...

247
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,043
If you don't want to turn out
like this,

248
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,380
you'll give up on
the Chunin Exam, too.

249
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,258
Sasuke, don't die...!

250
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,469
Big mistake if you think
I'd say that.

251
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,763
I was aware of this Genjutsu
right from the start!

252
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,764
What?!

253
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,183
The real Sasuke wouldn't do
something like

254
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,561
invite me to go for a walk!

255
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,730
Don't make me say
such frustrating things!

256
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,984
That kind of elementary Genjutsu
won't work on me!

257
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,194
Did you say elementary...?

258
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,362
That's right!

259
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,740
Incidentally, I've seen through that
you're also an illusion

260
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,576
and aren't really here!

261
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,662
I don't know about...

262
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,705
that!

263
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,462
See?

264
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,382
Just what I'd expect of
Kakashi's subordinate.

265
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,344
However, this will become reality
in the Chunin Exam!

266
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,929
I wonder if you can endure that...?

267
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,642
I'm not scared!
I'll take them on anytime!

268
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,937
The Chunin Exam isn't...
The Chunin Exam isn't...!

269
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,232
I'm still not sure if I can do it...

270
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,992
That was a stupid thing to do...

271
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,835
How was it?

272
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,338
We went to the trouble of having
a special preliminary exam,

273
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:07,092
but all nine of the rookies passed.

274
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:13,056
As you say, it appears their skills
have definitely improved.

275
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,937
Well, the actual Chunin Exam
won't just end at this, but...

276
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,732
Hey, have you heard?

277
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,150
Rookies are going to be
in the Chunin Exam

278
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,695
for the first time in five years.

279
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,238
No way.

280
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,658
It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills
or something anyway.

281
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,159
No...

282
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:37,163
The story is that three among them
are that Kakashi's unit.

283
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,124
That's interesting...

284
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,584
Well, be that as it may...

285
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,463
That's a sad story...

286
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,095
Sakura, you're late!

287
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,931
Yeah...sorry...

288
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,107
Morning, Sasuke.

289
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,150
Yeah...

290
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,737
Something's strange about Sakura.

291
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,996
So, are you sure you're going
to attempt taking

292
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,581
the Chunin Exam with that skill?

293
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,500
May it'd be best if you runts quit.

294
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,170
You're green-assed brats, after all.

295
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,882
Please let us through.

296
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,637
That's...mean...

297
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,557
What did you say?!

298
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,019
Listen!
We're being nice to you!

299
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,480
The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.

300
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,107
Many times have we seen
people quit Shinobi

301
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,861
as well as people who were
disabled for life

302
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,155
just because they took this Exam.

303
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,992
Also, a Chunin is at the level
of a unit leader.

304
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,203
Mission failures,
death of subordinates,

305
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,622
it's all part of the
responsibilities of a leader!

306
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,791
A brat such as this a Chunin?

307
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:08,588
What's so bad about weeding out
those who won't pass anyway?!

308
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,590
A just argument.

309
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,051
However, you will let me through.

310
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,598
And could you also immediately
undo this barrier created with Genjutsu?

311
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,559
I have business on the third floor.

312
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,895
What's this guy talking about...?

313
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:24,979
I don't know...

314
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,066
-Well, well...
-So you noticed, eh?

315
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,110
How about it, Sakura?

316
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,738
You should've been
the first one to realize it.

317
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,991
Your analytical strength and
Genjutsu know-how

318
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,453
has improved the most in our squad, so...

319
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,038
Sasuke...

320
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,666
Thank you...

321
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,419
Of course. I realized it ages ago!

322
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,421
You see, this is the second floor!

323
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,673
Yup!

324
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,805
Well, not bad...
But all you've done is to catch on.

325
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,640
Right?!

326
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,193
H-He's fast!

327
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,903
This person...

328
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,781
He's a different person from
when he was getting punched before!

329
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,909
He stopped my kick...

330
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,786
What's with that Chakra in his arm?

331
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,582
Hey, this isn't what you promised.

332
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,000
You were the one who said

333
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,003
you didn't want to carelessly
attract attention and be watched.

334
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:30,962
But...

335
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,465
Oh boy...
This again...

336
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,926
This guy...

337
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,429
The marks where he was hit
are disappearing.

338
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,097
Was he faking?

339
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,896
My name's Rock Lee.
Your name's Sakura, right...?

340
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,064
Huh?

341
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:55,236
Please go out with me!
I'll protect you until I die!

342
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,157
Absolutely...not.

343
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,576
Huh?

344
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,621
You're...too intense.

345
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,917
Hey, you there.

346
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,418
Identify yourself.

347
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,297
Dang it! Again?

348
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,924
It's always about Sasuke!

349
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,677
When asking someone his name,
give your own name first.

350
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,972
You're...a rookie, right?
How old are you?

351
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,017
I'm not obliged to answer.

352
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,101
What...?

353
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,854
Cute.

354
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,027
Too intense, huh...

355
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,280
Uninterested, huh...

356
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,660
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!

357
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,623
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats.

358
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,877
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.

359
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,836
Yeah...

360
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,675
It appears this year's test-takers
will be amusing...

361
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,970
For us proctors too, eh.

362
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,432
Good grief...

363
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:10,395
This Chunin Exam...
is full of monsters.

364
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,250
Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes
and bushy eyebrows.

365
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,877
Oh! It's you!

366
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,129
You're the overly intense guy
who just got rejected by Sakura.

367
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,298
What's with your bizarre
green jumpsuit?

368
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,510
What? You want to challenge me,
bushy-browed bumpkin?

369
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,181
I'll teach you that it's a million years
too soon to be doing that.

370
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:14,685
Next episode:
"Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!"

371
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,230
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!

372
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,315
