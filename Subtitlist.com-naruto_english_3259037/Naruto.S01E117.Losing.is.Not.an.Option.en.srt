1
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:20,730
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,941
I just want to convey

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,362
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:34,160
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:39,165
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,502
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:51,260
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you,

8
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,762
right?

9
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,141
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,561
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,273
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,067
In time,

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:12,239
we'll realize that it was everything

14
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:18,454
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,540
Trembling thoughts

16
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:28,589
swept into a vortex and melting away

17
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,278
Heh! It's over...

18
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:59,161
Losing is not an Option

19
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,789
What?!

20
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,173
Just barely... That was a close one.

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,177
But...I was able to throw it off
just a little.

22
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,388
There's no mistake.

23
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,642
He's now realized the secret
of the Byakugan.

24
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,063
What's the meaning of this? How?!

25
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,112
How was he able to throw it

26
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,531
a whole six inches from his vital point?!

27
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,541
I see... That Chakra!

28
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,836
He was emitting Chakra the whole time

29
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,963
and covered the area surrounding him!

30
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,426
And in a wide range to that extent.

31
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,470
No wonder he was able
to detect the arrow and

32
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:02,182
throw off the trajectory of it.

33
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:10,566
But constantly emitting that
much Chakra is a death throe...

34
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,236
If he doesn't go that far, he can't dodge.

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,530
In other words, there's no mistake.

36
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,574
It's as I hypothesized...

37
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,870
The arrow earlier was
totally invisible to him!

38
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,207
He doesn't carry out useless attacks...

39
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,878
And from the results,
he accurately examines the information.

40
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,513
And...he's also discovered
the weakness of my eyes...

41
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,973
Impressive.

42
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,312
Of all the enemies I've fought until now,

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,730
this guy's the strongest!

44
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,902
He has 360-degree sight.

45
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,656
And he unfailingly detects attacks

46
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,910
that penetrate the roughly
150-feeot circumference around him.

47
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,204
But for some reason,

48
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,873
there were Kunai Knives
he couldn't evade completely.

49
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,378
Why couldn't he evade them?

50
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,507
Because he couldn't see them!

51
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,595
In other words, even his Visual Jutsu
has a slight blind spot!

52
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:27,351
Being unable to see Kunai Knives entering
that blind spot, he's unable to react.

53
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,812
So he was dealing with attacks
from the blind spot

54
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,731
with that defense technique.

55
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,486
And I analyzed all the attacks
I carried out

56
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,196
and grasped them perfectly.

57
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,158
Right behind his first thoracic vertebra...

58
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,412
there exists a blind spot expanding
from a very small point.

59
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,719
Indeed, if he moves and
doesn't stabilize the blind spot,

60
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,513
it becomes difficult to aim there
with an arrow.

61
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,017
But such a trick...doesn't fool me!

62
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,480
Gentle Fist is pointless if
you don't come close to your enemy.

63
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:18,944
And you can't afford to think about
approaching me at this point.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,947
It's about how to escape now...

65
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:26,410
Though whether you struggle or not,
you're going to die anyway.

66
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,335
It seems you only
have a little Chakra left.

67
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,381
The fate of the small fry character
in an easy game

68
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,925
is to be destroyed right away!

69
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,513
It's useless!

70
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,333
A thread?!

71
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,295
I see, with this thread...

72
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,469
This time, the trajectory was thrown off
slightly by the trees, huh?

73
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,645
If that's the case...

74
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,107
I'll add some rotation this time.

75
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,526
So even if it hits a tree,

76
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,029
it'll just cut through and the trajectory
won't be thrown off.

77
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,490
And as before...

78
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,869
I'll control the arrow up until
150 feet away from him

79
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,163
using a thread with Chakra
flowing through.

80
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,415
I'll take aim at the moving target...

81
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,543
and plunge the arrow into
the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!

82
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,883
He's still standing up?

83
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,512
He's strong... He's much stronger than me.

84
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,474
I hardly have any Chakra left now.

85
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,352
I probably won't be able to evade
his next attack completely.

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,771
Is this it?

87
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,484
I'll win no matter what!

88
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,618
Naruto... I wonder what you'd do.

89
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,080
I've had enough.

90
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,960
I can't dodge it anyway.

91
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,261
He's stopped moving... Has he given up?

92
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,723
But just to make doubly sure...

93
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:39,436
Maximum destructive power
with 120% accuracy.

94
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,417
I've got him!

95
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,986
This is it.

96
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,697
Gentle Fist!

97
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,609
Wh-What? He still...?!

98
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,072
No! My attack just now
should've made the kill.

99
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,242
Substance with Chakra base...

100
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,828
It's meaningless against Gentle Fist.

101
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,788
Gentle Fist...

102
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,790
I see, in his final moments,

103
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,501
he funneled the last Chakra
through the thread!

104
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,012
Eight crows...

105
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,725
Again I couldn't see one of them.

106
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,105
What happened to him?

107
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,949
He damaged several of my internal organs.

108
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,035
But...I can still move.

109
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,129
You failure...

110
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:18,887
I told you... I don't know when to quit!

111
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,643
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?

112
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,940
Because I was called...a failure!

113
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,988
But if you're going to say it's futile,
you don't have to do anything!

114
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:42,452
After I become the Hokage,
I'll change Hyuga!

115
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,997
The Ninjutsu that you're good at, huh?

116
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,874
I was careless...

117
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:55,048
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu I stunk at.

118
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,096
Don't be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,

119
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,558
and how it can't be changed!

120
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,060
Unlike me,

121
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,021
you're not a failure.

122
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,152
Naruto...

123
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,613
Now it's become the three of us...

124
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,241
Don't worry about such things.

125
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,577
Both Choji and Neji will
catch up right away.

126
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,708
Choji had the trump card.

127
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,753
And I've fought Neji
in the Chunin exam, so I know...

128
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,714
Know what?

129
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,179
That he's...a true genius. Believe it!

130
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,184
I cannot lose...

131
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,437
Whether he's an enemy
much stronger than me...

132
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,647
or even if this body should fail me...

133
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,108
I cannot lose!

134
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,114
I have a reason why I cannot lose!

135
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,129
I've had a hard time of it this time.

136
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,052
I played too long...

137
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,625
I can't build up Chakra...

138
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,503
How? You should've been instantly killed!

139
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,088
How come you're alive?!

140
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,174
I couldn't completely evade it anyway.

141
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,928
So I was prepared to deliberately
take the hit.

142
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,141
And I knew of my own weakness
much more than you do...

143
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,813
There were eight crows, huh?

144
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,441
This Byakugan has a blind spot.

145
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:23,196
However, if I knew that your attack
would only come from there...

146
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,700
I could release my Chakra just
to that blind spot and detect the attack.

147
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,827
It's not so difficult to make

148
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,789
a move of just a few inches
to throw off the aim.

149
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,084
I'd suffer a serious injury,
but instant death can be avoided.

150
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,299
So you took the hit deliberately...?

151
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,135
It doesn't change the fact
that you're going to die here.

152
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,971
How can you go that far?!

153
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,477
"Of all the enemies,"
you're the strongest I've ever fought...

154
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,065
But, there's a reason why I cannot lose.

155
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:08,074
Of all those I've ever fought,
the strongest one said this to me...

156
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,874
-Unlike me...you are not a failure!
-Unlike me...you are not a failure!

157
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,293
He said that.

158
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,714
I've been called a genius all along.

159
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,800
So I cannot lose.

160
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,261
And for the sake of those guys who believe

161
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,765
that this humdrum and small me
is a genius!

162
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,194
"The fate of the small fry character
in a game is to be destroyed right away."

163
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,196
You said that, didn't you?

164
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,667
Look at this situation!

165
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:05,840
Things like fate,
isn't determined by someone!

166
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,222
I wonder...

167
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,684
You also look like you're going to die!

168
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,110
Neji, live.

169
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,529
More than anyone in the clan,

170
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,073
you're the man loved most
by the Hyuga ability...

171
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,872
I cannot die so easily.

172
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,587
Even if you act tough,
you can't stem the current now...

173
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:50,051
Master Sasuke ran to
the Sound Village by his own wish.

174
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,978
Sasuke is now in the darkness...

175
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,403
No...

176
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,781
Naruto...

177
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,577
You've got better eyes than me.

178
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:23,001
There's a person who can find him
in the darkness and save him.

179
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,464
Master Sasuke belongs to Lord Orochimaru.

180
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,636
No matter who it may be, they can't save...
He can save him!

181
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:45,732
Because...Naruto...you...

182
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,654
You saved me from the darkness!

183
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,417
Talking rubbish until the end...

184
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,004
But...

185
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,885
I haven't been pushed this far
since Kimimaro.

186
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,478
Damn it...

187
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,176
Everyone...

188
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,142
I'll leave the rest...

189
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,102
to you.

190
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,272
For the first time, I spoke to you

191
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,484
And you smiled

192
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,736
For the first time, I was able to speak

193
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

194
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,286
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

195
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,750
Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage

196
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:38,631
My clumsy attempts with words

197
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:44,345
You listened without turning away

198
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:50,727
No wonder I get carried away by you

199
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,816
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

200
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,486
I feel so sad

201
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,821
But...

202
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,948
For the first time, I spoke to you

203
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,868
And you smiled

204
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,787
For the first time, I was able to speak

205
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,957
In my own words

206
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,418
For the first time, I spoke to you

207
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,254
And you smiled

208
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,882
For the first time, I was able to speak

209
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,885
In my own words

210
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:28,931
For the first time, I spoke to you

211
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,902
Yahoo! The enemies are quite close!

212
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,071
All right! We'll catch up in a burst!

213
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,447
Speaking in terms of number,
we've got more!

214
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,324
If things go well,
we can get him back next!

215
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,910
Yeah! I don't feel like losing
with four against two!

216
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,828
-Four against two?
-That's twice the opponents' number!

217
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,955
Say-say. Were there four of us?

218
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,542
Are you an idiot?!
Me, Akamaru, Shikamaru, and you!

219
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,295
No matter how you count, there are four!

220
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,632
