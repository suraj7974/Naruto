1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,437
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,536
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,623
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,049
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,218
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,182
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,933
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,196
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,286
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,334
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,630
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:38,098
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Ibiki Morino,

21
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:42,353
proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.

22
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,400
You, from Hidden Sound Village!

23
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,488
No doing as you please
before the Exam!

24
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,657
You want to be failed
at the get go?!

25
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:02,122
Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,
so we flipped out...despite ourselves.

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,044
Hmph.This is a good opportunity,
so I'll say this.

27
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,296
There will be no battles,
competitions and the like

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,674
without the permission
of the proctors!

29
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,759
And even if you get permission,

30
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,887
actions that could lead to the death
of an opponent will not be permitted.

31
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,767
Any pig that screws with me
will be disqualified immediately.

32
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:22,852
Got it?!

33
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:30,150
This Exam looks to be easy!

34
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:37,324
Now then, we will start
the first test of the Chunin Exam!

35
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,243
Turn in your applications,

36
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,704
take one of these number cards
in exchange,

37
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,540
and sit in the seat
matching that number!

38
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,751
After that, we will hand out
the paper for the written test!

39
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,880
Written...? Paper...?

40
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,840
Paper...

41
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,555
A paper test?!

42
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,519
Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!

43
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:22,620
Everyone's seats are all scattered...
What should I do?

44
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,789
He's deflated, deflated...

45
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,667
It's the worst type of test for Naruto...

46
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,670
Naruto...

47
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,759
Oh! You are Hinata...!
Since when have you...?

48
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,972
L-Let's both do our best.

49
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,891
Y-Yeah.

50
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,436
I didn't notice her at all.

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,272
Hinata has no presence at all...

52
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:56,695
There are several important
rules to this first test.

53
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,743
I will take no questions,
so listen well accordingly!

54
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,205
Rules? No questions will be taken...?

55
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,707
First off is the first rule!

56
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,462
You are given ten points
each from the start!

57
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,048
The written test has
ten problems in all!

58
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,424
Each problem is one point.

59
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,387
And, this test is a
point deduction system.

60
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,140
You are deducted one point for
each problem you get wrong!

61
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,769
If you get three wrong,
you'll have seven points!

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,981
If I get ten wrong,
I'll have zero points...

63
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,483
The second rule.

64
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,068
Pass or failure will be determined

65
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,195
by the total points of
the three-person teams.

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,120
W-Wait a minute!

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,914
What do you mean...
total points of the teams?

68
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,332
Shut up!

69
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,292
There's a perfectly
good reason for this!

70
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,627
Shut up and listen!

71
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,170
Reason...?

72
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,631
If you've got it,
here is the most important next rule!

73
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,217
Those who are deemed by
the sentinels

74
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,972
as having committed an act of
cheating or something similar to that...

75
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,352
will have two points deducted
for each act.

76
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,312
What...?
Oh!

77
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,897
In other words...

78
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,275
there may be those who will be
dismissed during this test

79
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,320
without waiting for test grading.

80
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,367
This means they're deducting points

81
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,786
from things other
than the written test problems.

82
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,831
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating...

83
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,792
will bring ruin upon yourselves.

84
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,378
I'll check you anytime.

85
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,340
If you aspire to become
a Chunin at all,

86
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,428
know that Shinobi should act
like exemplary Shinobi.

87
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,807
Relax...!
Yes...yes!

88
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:52,561
Naruto aside,
Sasuke and I are okay!

89
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,398
Even if Naruto gets zero points...
if we cover that...

90
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:01,111
And, in the case of even one person
on the team getting zero points...

91
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,615
Everyone on that team will fail!

92
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,159
Wha...?!
What did he say...?!

93
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,622
I feel two menacing stares...

94
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,624
Naruto?

95
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,753
By the way, the last problem will
be given forty-five minutes

96
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,588
after the start of the test!

97
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,091
The time for the test is one hour.

98
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,720
Begin!

99
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,647
Could it...

100
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,233
Could it be that,
the fat is really on the fire now...?

101
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,194
Naruto...!
Just don't get zero points!

102
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:49,743
Naruto isn't getting jitters
from the get go, is he...?

103
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,703
This is bad...

104
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,251
As if!

105
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,547
I know I've cleared many obstacles
like this before...

106
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,257
At times like this, one should
look at all the problems

107
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,134
without feeling pressed
or making a fuss!

108
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,302
And then with utmost effort

109
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,097
I should tackle the problems that look
easy to understand!

110
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,101
Let's see, the first problem...
is a code text, eh...

111
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,019
Excellent, I say!

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,859
Next! Next!
Let's see...the second problem...

113
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,530
The parabola B in the diagram illustrates
the greatest possible distance

114
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:31,076
Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken
from a tree seven meters high...

115
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,038
Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's
character inferred

116
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,708
from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,503
also answer the longest firing range
in battle on flat ground

118
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,339
and explain your basis.

119
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:49,011
T-This is an...integrated problem based
on predictions

120
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:53,974
of uncertain conditions and
dynamic energy analysis application...!

121
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,727
There's no way
Naruto can solve this!

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,524
I mean... hardly anyone except me
can solve this problem!

123
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,278
Okay, next!
Next!

124
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,619
These other problems...
are nothing but difficult ones.

125
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,671
I see...

126
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't...understand even
one of these problems.

127
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,473
Oh, no, this is bad!

128
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,016
For real! For real!

129
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,395
What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:53,367
If about ten of all fifty-one teams
are able to pass,

131
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,703
it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself
and get a considerable amount of points.

132
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,998
It's like a system inviting cheating...

133
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,461
I hope Sasuke and Naruto
won't panic and cheat.

134
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,259
It's okay...
Naruto's not that much of an idiot...

135
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,843
I know that...

136
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,973
Don't panic...

137
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,059
For now, all there is to do is to be
very, very cautious...

138
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,521
and cheat without being found out!

139
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,944
No! No! I can't, that's no good,
no good!

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,280
I can't tread on such thin ice!

141
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,575
At any rate, this elaborate fuss...

142
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,413
It's like a trick assuming
that we're going to cheat.

143
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,874
They probably check with that paper...

144
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,337
Somebody got nailed.

145
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,383
Cheating deducts two points.

146
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,303
Two-point deduction, huh...

147
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,474
Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment
the cheating was discovered...

148
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,360
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating

149
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,363
will bring ruin upon themselves.

150
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,534
Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.

151
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,912
I see, so that's how it is, eh.

152
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,915
This wasn't just an achievement test!

153
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,625
The real aim was...

154
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,463
a test to see the ability
for intensive information collection

155
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,632
with the full use of deception
and concealment techniques.

156
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,221
"Shinobi should read
the double bluff," eh...

157
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,807
In other words, the true intention
of the proctor is...

158
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,603
if you're going to cheat,
not "awkward cheating,"

159
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:49,274
but "like exemplary Shinobi",
don't get caught.

160
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:53,028
Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness
of the point deduction system,

161
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:58,825
the lenience of only deducting two points
for each discovery of cheating makes sense.

162
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,952
In other words,

163
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,206
what's being tested here is how
we can gather the correct answers

164
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,918
without having our cheating detected
by the proctors or

165
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,213
by the one being cheated on.

166
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,174
Realize it quick, Naruto!

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,134
It'll turn into a fatal mistake!

168
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,594
Realize it!

169
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,937
This is bad. Believe it...

170
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:33,693
If the purpose of this test is seeing
the ability to gather information...

171
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,698
then there should be someone
in this classroom somewhere...

172
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,159
who knows the answers
to the problems!

173
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,834
So Gaara has also started, eh...

174
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,087
Hmph...I'm counting on you, Crow.

175
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:12,441
Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!
Next is problem four!

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,494
Judging from this rhythm...

177
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,581
The stroke order...
and the number of strokes...

178
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,792
I see.

179
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,144
Okay! Please tell me.

180
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,066
Eight, huh.

181
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,538
Lee, if you can see it,
wear your headband!

182
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,353
Time is rapidly going by!

183
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,523
Oh, man! I'm afraid all there
is to do is cheat...

184
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,609
But, if I'm discovered,

185
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,737
it'll be trouble for Sakura
and Sasuke.

186
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,865
On the other hand,
if I get zero points...

187
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,077
Sakura and Sasuke will be
my companions in failure.

188
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,745
Naruto...

189
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:55,710
I'll show you...my test.

190
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,795
Huh...?

191
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,423
What is Hinata saying...?

192
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,677
W-Why would she do
such a thing for me?

193
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,890
Could it be...some kind of trickery?

194
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,021
But Hinata is not one to do
something like that...

195
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:20,527
No... But she might've been coaxed into
attempting to trap me by Kiba and others...

196
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,405
Hinata, let me ask you one thing!

197
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,700
Huh?!
Why would you show me?

198
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,498
Uh...uh...actually...

199
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,503
I...I...

200
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:48,013
I don't want you, Naruto...
to leave at this stage...

201
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,479
Y-You see...
the nine of us are the only rookies...

202
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,858
and I have many anxieties about
what's to come, so!

203
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,823
I get it now! I was kind of
strangely suspicious of you!

204
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,747
Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!

205
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,749
Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...

206
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,930
W-What was that?
I was about to turn...

207
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,770
W-What was that for, sir?!

208
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,523
You made five mistakes. You fail!

209
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,901
N-No way...

210
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:47,864
His two buddies, both of you get out
of the classroom, right now.

211
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,337
#23 fails!

212
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,547
#43 and #27 fail!

213
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,259
Noooo!

214
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:13,640
Hey, hey! Do you have proof that
I cheated five whole times?!

215
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:18,144
Really, are you guys properly checking
this number of people...?

216
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,482
Listen up...

217
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:28,363
Even among us Chunin, we're elite
who were selected for this Exam.

218
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,033
We don't overlook you blinking once...

219
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,745
In a matter of speaking,
this strength is the proof.

220
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,001
Naruto...?

221
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,588
Hurry...Look...

222
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,653
Hinata... You don't get it, do you?

223
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,738
What...?

224
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,743
An awesome ninja like me
won't cheat. Believe it!

225
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,121
N-Naruto.

226
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,581
B-But...

227
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,711
Also, if something went wrong,

228
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:29,758
you'd be in a hot spot for
helping me cheat, right?!

229
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,343
\What?!
Naruto...

230
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,143
I'm...sorry...
I-I did something uncalled for...

231
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,937
Nah, it's okay.

232
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,692
I...went and acted big.

233
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,696
What should I do?
I'm extremely stupid.

234
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,994
Byakugan!

235
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,915
Sharingan!

236
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,043
I'll copy all his movements!

237
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,756
My hand is moving fluently...

238
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,008
I hit the jackpot straight away
with this guy.

239
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,764
Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.

240
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,141
I'm acknowledging that your smarts

241
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,728
and the width of your forehead
are exceptional.

242
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,147
So you should thank me.

243
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,108
Thank me for getting to be
the target for this Jutsu.

244
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,860
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

245
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,622
So Ino...started using that Jutsu...

246
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,501
There's no countering that spell of Ino's...

247
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:54,759
Sakura, I let myself move
into your mind for just a little bit.

248
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,263
I have to memorize the answers quick.

249
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,516
I've got to pass these answers
to Shikamaru and Choji.

250
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,310
#59! Fails!

251
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,313
#33! #9!

252
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,275
This is the thirteenth group to fail.

253
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,236
#41 fails.

254
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,489
#35, #62 fails!

255
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,824
No way!

256
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,537
That brat...

257
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:28,209
He coolly proceeds through this
ruckus without moving an eyelash.

258
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,546
Very well done considering he's new.

259
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,394
The optic nerves are connected...

260
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,397
The third eye...open!

261
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,332
Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...

262
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,791
Dang it...!

263
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,643
Excuse me.

264
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,144
What is it?

265
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,104
I need to go to the bathroom...

266
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,901
We will accompany you
to the bathroom.

267
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,153
I see...

268
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,789
Anyhow...the proctors are
nothing so special!

269
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:52,001
They don't realize that the proctors
have increased by one...

270
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,128
Eh, don't you think so...

271
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,381
Crow...?

272
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,097
Forty minutes have passed
since the test started...

273
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,557
Twenty minutes left...huh...

274
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,518
Since it's come to this,

275
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,022
it's the last problem to be given
forty-five minutes after the start of the test.

276
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,902
All there is to do is bet on this.
Believe it!

277
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,914
Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life
once I get it wrong?!

278
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,791
Really? Really? Really?

279
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,542
If I don't take it, I'll fail with
my comrades immediately?

280
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,461
No way, no way, no way.

281
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,296
The hopeless rule for problem ten!

282
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,006
Not good, not good, not good.

283
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,425
No way can I choose which one!

284
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,260
What to do, do, do, do.

285
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,721
This is seriously, seriously bad!

286
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,599
Bad, bad, bad, bad.

287
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,937
