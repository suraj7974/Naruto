1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,504
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,593
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,847
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,117
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,351
Look, Papa!

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,062
What is it, Kunihisa?

17
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,315
Look, it's sparkly and pretty.

18
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,858
That's right, Kunihisa.

19
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:55,032
Even though it's so pretty,
how can it have no value...

20
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,078
That's horrible, isn't it, Papa?

21
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,458
Impossible!
Celebirty Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!

22
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,420
A-Are you serious, Grandma Tsunade!

23
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,297
Calm down!

24
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,217
Sorry, I'll calm down.

25
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,640
Since he is an important person,

26
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,600
I believe there is no one appropriate
for the job other than you.

27
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:26,939
Finally... Finally a mission
appropriate for my abilities.

28
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,069
Guarding an important person...
It has such a nice ring to it!

29
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,698
Listen seriously!

30
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,993
Gotcha.

31
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,038
Okay, about this mission...

32
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,707
Shizune.

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,791
Yes!

34
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,880
The details are written in
those documents.

35
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,466
His name's Kunihisa,
he lives in the capital.

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,011
He's the heir of
an old acquaintance of mine.

37
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,971
Your acquaintance, Grandma Tsunade?

38
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,766
Yes, his father's name is Kunijiro.

39
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,186
He made his fortune in one generation.
He's a successful jeweler.

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,482
The heir of a jeweler...

41
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,238
Hey, Papa?

42
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,949
Is this real, too?

43
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,161
Of course it's real, little Kuni.

44
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:26,332
So, is that and that and this
and the one over there too?!

45
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,375
Of course, little Kuni!

46
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,337
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

47
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,259
Suddenly my motivation is boosted!

48
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,304
I'll do it! I'll do that mission!

49
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,307
So where is this Kunihisa at,
Grandma Tsunade?!

50
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,268
Come in!

51
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,147
– Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
– Wow! What's this brat?

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,733
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

53
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,443
Ninja?

54
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,196
Don't add that question mark at
the end of your sentence, don't!

55
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,323
So it must be you!

56
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,786
You are the kid who's going with Kunihisa
to play be a-Ninja-for-a-day...

57
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,497
I'll leave him to you, then.

58
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,293
What? Be a Ninja for a day...?

59
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,713
My little Kuni really admires Ninja,

60
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,841
and he aggravates me by saying
nothing but Ninja everyday.

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,471
Grandma Tsunade!

62
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,640
Wasn't this
the guarding-important-person mission?!

63
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,017
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,894
I did say he's an important person,

65
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,813
but didn't say a word about
guarding him.

66
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,731
I was fooled! Grandma!

67
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:33,816
Naruto Uzumaki!

68
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,904
I order you to play be
a-Ninja-for-a-day with Kunihisa!

69
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,865
Damn... That's a dirty trick, Grandma!

70
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,784
Oh, there's one more thing.

71
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,829
I added your regular missions
as a service.

72
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:51,792
Oh, that's cruel, Grandma Tsunade!

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,968
Clean the pond, repair the bridge,
get rid of the savage pig,

74
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,012
and...

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,268
It turns out that babysitting is just added
to the regular D-rank missions!

76
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,854
Ninja, Ninja.

77
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,153
Watch this, Kunihisa!

78
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,572
I'll teach you the awesomeness
of a Ninja.

79
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,497
Hey, awesome Naruto! Awesome!

80
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,084
It's "be-a-Ninja-for-a-day," isn't it?

81
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,795
So Kunihisa, you gather garbage
from over there, too.

82
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,088
Okay!

83
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,883
Oh, that's right.
Don't go into the marsh.

84
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,342
This marsh is bottomless,

85
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,971
so once you're caught,
you can't get out.

86
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,765
Huh, what?

87
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,142
– Oh, no, Young Master is in trouble!
– Naruto!

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,145
What are you doing?!

89
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,648
You fool! I'll save you,
so you stay right there!

90
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,108
Fool! I'll be fine.

91
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,735
You'll be fine?

92
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,820
I can handle this kind of simple task
with my Ninjutsu.

93
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,864
Ninjutsu?

94
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,617
– Oh no! Young Master!
– Oh, no!

95
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,456
Alligator snapping turtle, Piranha, Toad!

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,957
Money Style:

97
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,377
Help Me Jutsu!

98
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:18,796
What?!

99
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,715
– Yay!
– Mine!

100
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,884
Wha...?! Wh-Wh-Wha...?!

101
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,435
I'm fine!

102
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,357
What are you guys doing?!

103
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,319
If you want money hurry up
and rescue me.

104
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,034
What good would increasing
the victims do?

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,750
Hey, Kunihisa.

106
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:57,876
Huh?

107
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,964
Who are they?

108
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,423
Oh, them...

109
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:09,471
Papa employs them and
they protect me if I get into trouble.

110
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,515
Really.

111
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,976
That's right, for example...

112
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,812
There!

113
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,028
See!

114
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,072
What do you mean "see"?!

115
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,033
Is it okay?

116
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,161
I said it's okay!

117
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,080
Really, really okay?

118
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,168
What are you so freaked out about?
It's okay!

119
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,796
But still, it's scary!

120
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,632
Cut the bull and come here now!

121
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,717
R-Right!

122
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,344
But just before that...

123
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,306
Ninja Art: Scapegoat Jutsu!

124
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,479
See? It's fine.
C'mere, quick!

125
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,443
If I get on it next,
I think it might break...

126
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,069
Let's check out a bunch more.

127
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,745
I'm not finished yet! More of you!

128
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,871
Go!

129
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,212
What the...?!

130
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,219
Just as I thought.

131
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,598
I thought I was gonna die.

132
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,017
What were you doing, Kunihisa?!

133
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,855
What would have happened if
I'd got on the bridge like that?

134
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,149
C'mon you!

135
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,526
Okay everyone, your compensation!

136
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,028
Here!

137
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,906
I'm telling you, stop that!

138
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,911
That kid...
He's got money, huh, Big Brother.

139
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,415
Yeah... And his main guard
is a single Genin.

140
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,585
Big Brother, it's decided.

141
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,254
Yeah.

142
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,220
What's next?

143
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,640
Get rid of the savage pig
who appears in the field ahead.

144
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,309
Okay! I'll do my best!

145
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,437
What the...?!

146
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,939
A savage pig...?

147
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,067
More like a monster!

148
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,151
Crap!

149
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,820
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

150
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,072
That's cool!

151
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,912
Naruto!

152
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,456
Okay! It's my turn this time!

153
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,211
F-Fool! What are you doing?
Hurry up and escape!

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,216
Here I go!
Ninja Art: Money Clone Jutsu!

155
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,095
Money Clone?!

156
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,766
Huh?!

157
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,727
Hey, you ugly savage pig!

158
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,230
Starting now,
I, Kunihisa, will punish you!

159
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,650
Go!

160
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,698
Go! Get him! There!

161
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:23,415
What, nobody wants to eat your meat!
You dummy!

162
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,011
He ordered all of this!
What?!

163
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,764
I didn't want to,
but he forced me to...

164
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,057
Huh? W-Wait...

165
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,351
That's a lie. It's a misunderstanding!

166
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,771
Those are false charges!

167
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,321
Forgive me! Naruto...

168
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,532
I... How should I put this...?

169
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,494
really hate guys like you!

170
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,705
Why are you getting so testy?

171
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,084
Geez, poor people just can't help
that they have short tempers...

172
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,382
This'll put you back in a good mood.

173
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,050
Take as much as you want!

174
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,218
Enough already!

175
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,262
I'm telling you to stop
doing stuff like that!

176
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,347
Why?

177
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,433
It's a big mistake to think that
anything can be resolved with money!

178
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,561
There are times when you have
to use your own power!

179
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,525
There hasn't been anything that
I couldn't do with money so far!

180
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,403
You... Are you always like this?

181
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,072
With that personality,
you can't make friends!

182
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,783
It's okay 'cause
I can buy friends with money!

183
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,951
What...?

184
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,579
You... Buy friends? You mean...

185
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,250
If I give 'em money,
everybody will be my friend!

186
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,585
Kunihisa...

187
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,089
That's why I hate country Ninjas.

188
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,259
They're cheap and stink of poverty...

189
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,803
Stupid!

190
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,724
Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!

191
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,567
Running made me hungry.

192
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,153
Take this and buy a boxed lunch!

193
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,822
There's nothing like a store
to buy lunch around here.

194
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,283
Well, snacks will be fine!

195
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,618
There's no convenient store
or candy shop...

196
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:28,081
You're useless!
This is why I hate the country!

197
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,253
Stupid Naruto.

198
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
What's that?

199
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,801
Oh, Young Master!

200
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,096
Oh!

201
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,600
Little fish, little fish!

202
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,061
Let's eat!

203
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,191
The kid must be stupid to get
caught in this cheap trick.

204
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,317
Don't you agree, Bro?

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,401
Yeah!

206
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,038
Huh? Naruto?!

207
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,374
Aw man,
you're really high maintenance.

208
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,792
Those two guys just now...

209
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,794
They were going to catch you!

210
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,590
They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever...

211
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,800
Whatever...?

212
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,262
I'm often a target,
because I have money.

213
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
Often a target...? You...

214
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,477
More importantly,
I want to eat more fish!

215
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,479
Go find a shop and buy some.

216
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,734
You... Still think you can do
anything with money?

217
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,821
All right, watch this!

218
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,995
Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!

219
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:50,956
How's that?!

220
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,460
You can just get things using
your own power without using money.

221
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,798
Even... without using money?

222
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,009
Damn!

223
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,929
He attacked us by surprise,
that cowardly bastard.

224
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,806
I'll give it back to him doubled!

225
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,599
Well, wait...

226
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,394
If we do it thoughtlessly,
we'll just get creamed again.

227
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,271
So what do we do?

228
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,855
We'll use that thing.

229
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,190
That thing...?

230
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,865
Look close at the movement
of the fish...

231
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,785
Aim for the instant when
they fall after jumping up.

232
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,245
Don't get hasty.

233
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,831
Now!

234
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,541
Oh!

235
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,334
That was close!

236
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,878
O-One more time, Naruto!

237
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,172
I'll get the Kunai knife,
so one more time!

238
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,008
Master Kunihisa!

239
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,677
– It's deep over there!
– Please be careful!

240
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,762
I know, I know...

241
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,182
Where did it go?

242
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,602
I think it's in this area, but...

243
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,523
I won't let you get away this time!

244
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,984
You guys...

245
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,904
We hired these guys with
the money you threw away.

246
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,241
It means that now,
they're on our side...

247
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,995
Hey, you guys! I'll pay you double
what those guys did!

248
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,788
So be on my side...

249
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,915
Wh-What the...?

250
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,713
Looks like you've run out of money.

251
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,092
How about you guys over there?
Wanna join us?

252
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,220
We'll pay up stacks of money.

253
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,724
Humph! These guys have been
with me for a long time.

254
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,100
That paltry sum won't...

255
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,146
We're not going along with
your selfish acts any longer!

256
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,440
Y-You guys?!

257
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,362
No! I don't like it!

258
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,823
Annoying brat. I'll have to tie you up
so you won't move.

259
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,248
What are you doing, Kunihisa?!

260
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,876
Naruto, I... I...

261
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
It's fine already!

262
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:07,300
Hey you... I'll pay you double what
you get for your mission.

263
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,303
Won't you hand that brat over to us?

264
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,724
We're just going to demand
ransom money from his parents is all.

265
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,478
We won't kill him.
Relax and hand him over.

266
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,983
I-It's not enough?
Here, how about this?

267
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,819
Naruto...

268
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,821
Kunihisa! Ride on my back!

269
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,030
O-Okay.

270
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:35,412
S-Still not enough, huh? Here!
That's all of it! Take it!

271
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,455
Like I said...

272
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,168
It's a big mistake to think
you can obtain anything with money!

273
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,795
Crap!

274
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,171
After them!

275
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,884
Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.

276
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,969
Okay!

277
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,890
Damn! I can't move
with him on my back!

278
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,899
I can't see the bottom, Naruto...

279
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,445
Go!

280
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,075
Okay! You go on ahead.

281
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,785
What?! Go on ahead?!

282
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,332
There he is! Let's get him!

283
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,459
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

284
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,085
Wh-What are you doing?!

285
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,795
It's okay! Hurry up and jump!

286
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,383
I-I can't... I'm scared, Naruto!

287
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,343
It's not scary, c'mon!

288
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,095
I can't... I'm scared...!

289
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,266
-Damn it!
-Do it!

290
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,728
Naruto!

291
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,856
Well, you're coming with me!

292
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,066
Hurry! Kunihisa!

293
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,151
B-But.....

294
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,696
It's okay... You can definitely do this!
Believe it!

295
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,157
Prepare yourself!

296
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,078
No way!

297
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,581
Go Kunihisa!

298
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,291
Oh, Big Brother!

299
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,509
Huh?! Kunihisa?!

300
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,555
It hurts!

301
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm going to clean those guys out
and then I'll be right over!

302
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,353
So wait a second!

303
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,273
D-Daruto...

304
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,571
D-Darudo!

305
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,367
The wall's collapsing... Escape!

306
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,745
How long are you guys gonna be
on top of me!

307
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,539
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

308
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,792
Wh-Wh-What's going on?!

309
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,795
I have to go to him!

310
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,591
There are times when you have
to use your own power!

311
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,095
Use my own...power!

312
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,561
You can just get things using
your own power with out using money.

313
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,230
Even without money...

314
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,774
with my own power!

315
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,862
I can...do this!

316
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,032
Just one step short!

317
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,202
Naruto!

318
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,288
Kunihisa!

319
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,254
No! A little bit more!

320
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,341
– We did it!
– We did it!

321
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,759
All right!

322
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,808
I-It hurts but...
I'm scared but...

323
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,518
I...!

324
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,564
You... What a face?!

325
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,318
Kunihisa...

326
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,322
You did a good job!

327
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,829
Darudo!

328
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,707
Wha...?!
Hold on, don't drip snot!

329
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,001
But Naruto!

330
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,794
Stop it!

331
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,217
Well... See ya!

332
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,429
Yeah! Next time you come play
at my house, Naruto!

333
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,473
Okay!

334
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,560
Really... You took great care of him.
Thank you!

335
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,770
Yeah, well...

336
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,314
Well then...

337
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,398
Yes...

338
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,325
Papa, Papa!

339
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,369
What is it, little Kuni?

340
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,829
Look, it's sparkly and pretty...

341
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,917
But it has no value,
it's just a marble, little Kuni.

342
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,711
That's true, Papa...

343
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,755
But...

344
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,802
As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter
whether it's valueless, right?

345
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,738
The wind blows, Ah...

346
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,575
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

347
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,120
What should be brought along?

348
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,123
Assemble them into a piece.

349
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,085
There is no second chance, never

350
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,796
How foolish it is to throw away

351
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,091
Acting so innocently, Ah...

352
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,676
The images.

353
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:49,017
It probably will not end

354
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,314
It probably will not end

355
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,069
Burn that love-filled heart,

356
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,197
Sail across a thousand dreams

357
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,117
Running freely

358
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

359
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,999
The clouds scatter

360
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,044
The sun sets yet again

361
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:22,550
The solo parade begins to move.

362
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

363
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,265
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

364
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,735
All right, I'm fired up!
Our mission this time is a treasure hunt!

365
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,447
But your recent low mission
success rate concerns me.

366
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,658
No need to worry.
We've got a map, so it'll be a cinch!

367
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:48,743
I've thought about it, you see...

368
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,369
No need to think, believe it!

369
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,163
If you fail this mission...

370
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,539
It'll be okay, I tell you!

371
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,167
You'll all start over again
from the Academy!

372
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,835
What?!

373
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,547
Next time: "The Treasure Hunt is On!"
