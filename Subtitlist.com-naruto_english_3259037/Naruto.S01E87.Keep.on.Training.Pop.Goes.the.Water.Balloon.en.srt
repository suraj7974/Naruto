1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,811
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,324
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,711
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,645
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,149
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,861
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,118
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,292
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,838
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,140
I've done it!
The water is turning!

21
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,061
It seems it's going to be easier
than I thought to break it.

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,317
Then I'll go take a little rest
until it's done...with this.

23
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,528
Hey! What is that?!

24
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:56,242
I need it to kill the time.
And also to get some sleep.

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,621
Huh! The way it's going,
it won't even be an afternoon nap!

26
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,334
Is that so...?
Call me when it is broken.

27
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,044
Just wait!

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,049
If it keeps up like this,
I'll learn it within today!

29
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,059
Keep on Training!
Pop Goes the Water Balloon

30
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:40,035
Oh man! Why doesn't it break!

31
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,581
Huh? Are you done with it?

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,504
Ah...well, it's almost done
or how should I call it.

33
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,631
Oh boy...

34
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,427
It seems like I went beyond
an afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.

35
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,931
Hey, hey...how do I break it?

36
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,606
Didn't I tell you I can't give
a detailed explanation until it's broken?

37
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,735
All right, I understand...

38
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,073
Naturally, you're supposed to realize it
through trial and error

39
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,910
when mastering a Jutsu, but...

40
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,119
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,332
I guess I'll teach you just
a tiny bit on the Jutsu...

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,002
You, try rotating the water!

43
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh, okay.

44
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:42,348
Right or left...which direction did you
imagine when you rotate it?

45
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,185
Hmm...well, to the left...

46
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,646
Hey, come over here.

47
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,813
Okay...

48
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,488
Huh, I thought so...

49
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,324
W-What?

50
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,994
You are in fact a right-rotation type.

51
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,621
Right?

52
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,414
In order to build up Chakra,

53
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,542
it is necessary to blend the energy...

54
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:15,005
Chakra
Spiritual energy Physical energy
So everybody unconsciously builds up
Chakra inside the body by rotating it.

55
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,717
Right Left
Whether the rotation at that point
is to the right or to the left

56
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,469
differs in the individual.

57
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,764
Therefore, if you imagine
the rotation of the water balloon

58
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,476
opposite to that of your rotation-type
in this training,

59
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,688
your Chakra flow divides and resists

60
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,482
and the momentum of
the rotation does not get on track.

61
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,696
You should be able to figure
that kind of stuff on your own.

62
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:43,450
But how did you figure out that
I'm a right-type so fast?

63
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,037
The cowlick on your head!

64
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,082
It's pretty much determined that you're
a right type if a whorl rolls to the right

65
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,835
and you're a left-type
if it rolls to the left.

66
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,503
It's simple.

67
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:58,215
Huh, so I have a right roll!

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,970
Yes, so if you want to rotate it,
you have to imagine a right rotation.

69
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,807
I never really paid attention
that until now...

70
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,227
But this Jutsu is just the one for you.

71
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,691
Hand sign is completely unnecessary.
All you need is Chakra.

72
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,861
There is no need to learn
a finicky hand sign!

73
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,779
It's okay to be stupid!

74
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,282
I'm not stupid!

75
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,826
I'm the man who's eventually going
to become a Hokage!

76
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,244
It's easy once you understand!

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,248
This Jutsu, I'll completely master it
if I got three days!

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,334
Three days, huh?

79
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,506
This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu
that the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.

80
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,591
Huh...?

81
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,095
It took him three whole years
to perfect this Jutsu...

82
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,722
This Jutsu is second from the top

83
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,308
on the six degrees of
difficulty in mastering...

84
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,770
It's an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.

85
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:58,358
In order to learn this move,
there are three steps in the training.

86
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,154
This "Water Balloon Breaking"
is the first step.

87
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,950
It took the genius Ninja,
the Fourth Hokage...

88
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,954
Three years...

89
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,958
There's no point in explaining
anymore to someone

90
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,628
who can't even clear the first step.

91
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,297
Do the rest by yourself!

92
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,966
Take care!
I'm going to return to the town.

93
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,928
I have to gather some information...

94
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,805
What will you do?

95
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,976
A-rank in degree of difficulty
in mastering...

96
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,313
The Ninjutsu left behind
by the Fourth Hokage...

97
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,988
I'm not gonna go back yet!

98
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,449
Huh...

99
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,160
So long... Don't go overboard with it.

100
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,336
Now, what will happen?

101
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,755
It's something to be concerned about...

102
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,507
Mister!

103
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,509
Why don't you stop by?

104
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,594
This month is our special service month.

105
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,681
Whoa! It's a special service month?

106
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,058
The more you visit,
the more you benefit.

107
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,518
Here you go, a stamp card!

108
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,062
I'll give you lots and lots of service!

109
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,274
I'll come, I'll come!

110
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,169
Hey! Come on down, Shu!

111
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,673
Hey, hey, where is the toilet?

112
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,933
I don't have time to spend three years.

113
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,060
All right now!

114
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,731
Training, once again today!
I'm gonna work hard like a blaze!

115
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,697
Break! Break! Break!

116
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,244
Why won't it break?

117
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,088
Little Jiraiya, you're so naughty!

118
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,676
Men are all naughty!

119
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,394
Dang it!

120
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,858
Three days have passed since
I got the tip from that Pervy Sage...

121
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,820
The rubber is stretched this much,
but why won't it break?

122
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,158
What am I doing different from
that Pervy Sage?

123
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,123
This is great! This is so great!

124
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,429
What the...?

125
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,522
Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.

126
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,901
I'm gonna eat now!

127
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,821
Huh?

128
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,033
What's the matter?

129
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,082
Oh dang it!

130
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,168
Darn it! Why is it like this?!

131
00:09:55,178 --> 00:10:00,434
No need to learn a finicky hand sign!
It's okay to be stupid!

132
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,814
He said that there's no need to form
a hand signal, but...

133
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,165
Hey! That's not your toy...

134
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,844
This is it!

135
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:44,770
Hurry up and wake up!
Hey, you Pervy Sage!

136
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,273
Uh... G-Good timing.

137
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,359
Why don't you bring me some water...

138
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,902
Water?

139
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,621
The first step is cleared!

140
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,457
Cleared...?

141
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,919
Well, let's have you show it to me.

142
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,506
All right! Watch it carefully!

143
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,179
Left hand?

144
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,859
Go!

145
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,825
All right! See that?! See that?!

146
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,622
You're sleeping!

147
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,000
Sorry, sorry.

148
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm tired from the days and nights
of gathering information.

149
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,424
But that seems suspicious to begin with!

150
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,384
You still stink of alcohol too!

151
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,471
Nevertheless...

152
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,516
You rotate the water inside the water balloon
that you hold in your left hand

153
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,061
by repeatedly applying it
with your right hand...

154
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,647
It seems little strange of an idea, but...

155
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,691
You're an interesting kid.

156
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:20,991
You understood the trick pretty well.
It's all thanks to me, though.

157
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,495
It's thanks to this guy!

158
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,456
Huh?

159
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:32,169
I realized after I saw this cat playing
with the water balloon.

160
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,298
He kept on flicking it with
his paw many times

161
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,009
and the water inside shocked
in all different kinds of direction...

162
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,136
Then it came to me like "bingo!"

163
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,097
How did it come like "bingo"?

164
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,809
The time when the Pervy Sage
first showed me breaking it...

165
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,771
I remembered how the water balloon
surface was not smooth.

166
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,525
Until then,
I was always only rotating the water

167
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,486
in the one same direction...

168
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,114
I realized that the Pervy Sage's
water balloon was not smooth

169
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,535
because the water inside was rotating
in different directions.

170
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,332
And after doing it in my own way,
it broke!

171
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,251
It seems it's still not possible for you

172
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,379
to rotate it violently with one hand, but...

173
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,549
I suppose you thought it out
in your own way.

174
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,594
That's just what he expected of me!

175
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,806
Anyhow...
The first step is complete for now.

176
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,308
All right!

177
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,394
Do you want to see it one more time?
One more time!

178
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,687
Oww!

179
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,274
You used too much Chakra and
it gradually reached the point

180
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,527
where there's burden
on the Chakra Network...

181
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,988
But the next one won't be like this!

182
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,995
Okay. Now, we will proceed
to the second step.

183
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,288
Yeah!

184
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,375
It seems like we can finally go
into some serious training!

185
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,834
– Here you go!
– Huh?

186
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:00,840
Rubber ball?
Something like this again?!

187
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,260
Now, you'll break this one!

188
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,016
It's one hundred times harder
than the water balloon!

189
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,988
It's hard...

190
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,701
The first step is rotation,
the second step is force.

191
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,120
Since there is no water inside,

192
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,747
it's more difficult to imagine
the rotation of Chakra,

193
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,666
so it becomes more difficult
to rotate the Chakra as well.

194
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,918
That's true...

195
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,337
I'll leave that to your own judgment.

196
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,591
I need to learn a trick again
to do this, don't I?

197
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,512
Well then,
I'll go gather some information.

198
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,389
Hey! Wait, wait!

199
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,017
Let's train together for
the first time in a while!

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't mind if you take a nap.

201
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,686
Don't depend on me!

202
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,815
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!

203
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,944
I did say that I'll teach you the Jutsu,

204
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,530
but I don't have the obligation
to teach you every step of the way.

205
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,907
If you can't do it by yourself,
then that's it.

206
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,954
Don't be childish forever...
Become more respectable like a Shinobi!

207
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,498
Well, well then.

208
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,669
If you can at least teach me...
the trick again...

209
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,505
Money!

210
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,509
Money...money...money...

211
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,096
W-What do you mean
"be respectable like a Shinobi"?!

212
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,932
Even though you say that,
you're an dirty and greedy adult!

213
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,393
You're not a respectable Shinobi at all!

214
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,662
It's way more difficult than
the time with the water balloon...

215
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,457
A-And...

216
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,504
my hands and arms hurt.

217
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,785
Dang it! How many days am I
going to be doing the same thing!

218
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,754
Second from the top in
the difficulty of mastering...

219
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,841
Don't depend on me!

220
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,593
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!

221
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,011
Dang it!

222
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,392
Hey, Naruto.

223
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,227
What did you come here for?

224
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,813
Go buy some food from the town below.

225
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,149
What?! Why me?

226
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,650
Hey you...

227
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,611
Even if for a while, you're still
learning the Jutsu from me.

228
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,535
Here you go, thanks for waiting.

229
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,120
Thank you.

230
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,125
How dare he put on a master's face
only at a time like this

231
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,669
when he doesn't teach me anything...

232
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,756
Dad, buy me some ice cream.

233
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,675
I want this one that cracks.

234
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,764
Here.

235
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,684
Why? I can eat all of it by myself.

236
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:44,731
Nope, when you get home,
your mother will have supper ready.

237
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,982
Okay!

238
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,990
Hey...you know...
Huh?

239
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,912
Can you be around my training
for just a while...today?

240
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,498
I don't have time for that.

241
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,875
I have to immediately go to town.

242
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:10,173
Unless you think for yourself and
get a grip of the trick for yourself,

243
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,134
it'll never work.

244
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,679
I thought I told you three weeks ago!

245
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,185
Don't be spoiled like a kid.
You are a Ninja.

246
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,236
I know that without
your telling me!

247
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,863
Just thought I'd ask.

248
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,449
Hurry up and go,
you Pervy Sage!

249
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,994
Oh no, little Jiraiya,
you tell so many lies!

250
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,706
What do you mean?!
Everything is true!

251
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,778
Dang it! It doesn't break
no matter how much I try...

252
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,366
I'm just dripping away
my Chakra this way.

253
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,494
Also...

254
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:26,291
The more I increase the amount of flow,
the worse the pain gets.

255
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,419
But... How do I say it?

256
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,379
If I don't go all out as if
to explode the Chakra,

257
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,840
it's not going to break!

258
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:40,889
That's it!

259
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,183
If I understand the amount of Chakra
that flows from the pain I feel...

260
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:48,354
Then I can bear the pain to the limit
and all at once...

261
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,317
No, not yet...

262
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,861
Not yet!

263
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,950
Not yet...store it!

264
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,830
Now!

265
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,876
Oww!

266
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,306
Hmm... There seems to have been
a little progress.

267
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:24,974
Humph!

268
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,685
I've still only opened a hole
and it hasn't popped with a bang!

269
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,648
Hey, don't pretend to be so tough. Here!

270
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,819
You've done well,
all on your own power.

271
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,577
It's so good!

272
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,828
Yes...

273
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,583
Oh yeah. Maybe we'll test a bit.

274
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,669
What, what?

275
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,504
Give me your right hand.

276
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,014
What's this?

277
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,439
A cycle of hardship, right?

278
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:18,277
Inside, we were crying, right?

279
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:26,369
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

280
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,623
It's a secondary role,

281
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,337
a role in the shadows

282
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

283
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

284
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,270
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

285
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:57,316
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

286
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,277
Over and over,

287
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,822
we believed

288
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,076
and dreamed

289
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,582
Over and over,
we've seen fools

290
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:18,171
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

291
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,175
Now, it's our turn...

292
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:29,057
Let us bask in our dreams

293
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,984
He tells me
"focus, focus, focus!"

294
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,112
But I've never been good at it, ever.

295
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,407
Speaking of concentration,

296
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,369
Iruka Sensei used to scold me often
at the Ninja Academy

297
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,371
for my lack of concentration.

298
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:58,503
Oh...I would've listened to him better
if I knew this would happen.

299
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time: "Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf"
