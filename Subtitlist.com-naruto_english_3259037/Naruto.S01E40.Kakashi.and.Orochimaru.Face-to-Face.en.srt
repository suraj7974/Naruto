1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,903
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,378
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,839
Now

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,812
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,414
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,143
Curse Sealing!

19
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,831
Out of character.

20
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,749
It appears he's quite tired...

21
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,711
To think you've become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu...

22
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,925
You've grown, eh, Kakashi...?

23
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,848
You...

24
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:30,067
Long time no see, Kakashi.

25
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,028
Orochimaru...

26
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,577
Kakashi vs. Orochimaru:
Face to Face!

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,289
Sorry, but...

28
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,709
I have no business with you, Kakashi.

29
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,045
But I do with the kid behind you.

30
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,761
Why are you after Sasuke...?!

31
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,560
It's good for you.
You already got it, right?

32
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,398
You didn't have it before, did you...?

33
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,482
That.

34
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,777
That...

35
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,655
left eye Sharingan!

36
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,912
I want it, too...

37
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,790
The Uchiha power.

38
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,098
Come on. Get up.

39
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,653
W-What?!

40
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,096
B-Bugs?

41
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,391
They burst through the skin...
from inside his body?!

42
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,477
What a creepy guy!

43
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,274
Heh! What kind of bluff
are you trying to pull?

44
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,752
These things are called Parasitic Insects.

45
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,964
They attack their pray in groups
and eat Chakra...

46
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,967
If attacking in this amount...

47
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,178
you're finished, no mistake.

48
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,099
If you don't like that, give up.

49
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,976
That would be in your best interests.

50
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,229
If you use your left arm
technique on me,

51
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,275
I'll simultaneously have the bugs exploit
the opening from behind.

52
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,486
Conversely, if you use
your technique on the bugs,

53
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,656
I'll simultaneously exploit the opening...

54
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,370
Either way, you won't be able
to get through this.

55
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,459
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside.

56
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,926
Hey! Hold it!

57
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,434
You little thief!

58
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,480
Someone! Grab him!

59
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,655
Uh-oh.

60
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,977
Man, what a pigheaded kid.

61
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,231
Making us go to trouble!

62
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,002
You have potential, boy.

63
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,277
I liked your eyes earlier...

64
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,785
If you come with me,
you can become strong.

65
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,207
Follow me.

66
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,844
If you come with me,
you can become strong.

67
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,477
You can become strong.

68
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:57,120
Fight for me. If you do that...

69
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,873
I'll make you stronger.

70
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,979
Now, please live up to my expectations...

71
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,072
No longer...

72
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,493
will I...

73
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,877
It seems like you're proud
of your arms. You!

74
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,838
S-Stop it!

75
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,594
Stop!

76
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,392
No longer...

77
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,397
can I make things
blow up in my face!

78
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,699
Don't...underestimate me!

79
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,471
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?!

80
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,154
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?

81
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,285
What?! He could already
use his right arm?!

82
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,290
So the first half of the battle was
a strategic move

83
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,252
to make us think he couldn't
use his right arm.

84
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,254
Not bad...Zaku.

85
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,431
What's your purpose?

86
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,854
The recently built Sound Village.
That's my village, you see...

87
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,276
You already understand, don't you...?

88
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,863
Humph! Ridiculous ambition.

89
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,408
Oh, my... you said it.

90
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:29,374
But, for that I need various pieces
who will obey my every whim.

91
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,336
Take this!

92
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,299
So Sasuke is one of those pieces?

93
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:41,803
No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.

94
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:46,266
And the ones who are taking
the exams now...

95
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,687
are mere throw-away pieces.

96
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,912
My arms!

97
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,214
What's this?!

98
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,052
Earlier when I recommended
that you give up...

99
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,222
as a precautionary measure,
I gave a suggestion to the bugs...

100
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:32,812
to block that troublesome wind hole
with their bodies and remain still.

101
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,775
This is what a real ace in the hole is.

102
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,198
Punk!

103
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,776
Don't...come any closer...to Sasuke!

104
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,996
Even if you're one of
the legendary three Ninja,

105
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,791
at the least,
I can kill you as you kill me!

106
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,430
What's funny?

107
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,935
What you say and what you do,
are all off.

108
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,270
What?

109
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,566
There's no point at all in
attempting such a seal.

110
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,235
You understand, don't you?

111
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,030
The heart to seek out
in pursuit of the goal,

112
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,326
no matter what obstructive power
there may be...

113
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,746
He is the possessor of that quality.

114
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,041
He's an avenger...

115
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,043
So you took advantage of that, eh?

116
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,961
However, Sasuke is...

117
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:25,050
At some point,
he will definitely seek me out...

118
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,595
in search of power.

119
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:34,893
Oh, and, you're going to kill me...?

120
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,603
Why don't you try?

121
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,314
That is, if you can...

122
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,082
Kill you as you kill me...?!

123
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,292
Am I an idiot...?

124
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,895
It seems...it's over.

125
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,899
The winner! Shino Aburame!

126
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,619
W-What is he, Neji?!

127
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,791
Byakugan!

128
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,965
He's something else...!

129
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,301
I can understand him calling bugs
with a Summoning Jutsu...

130
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,805
but he harbors bugs all over his body.

131
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,099
S-Say what?!

132
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:01,104
He's of the bug tamer race that
is passed down in the Leaf Village.

133
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,690
Speaking of which,
I've heard of it...

134
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,651
The story of a race that as
they come into this world,

135
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,863
possess the secret technique of loaning
their bodies to bugs

136
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:15,326
as a nest and fight using these bugs.

137
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,833
They fully control the bugs and
entrust most of the battle to the bugs...

138
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,128
I hear that they contract to keep
giving the bugs their own Chakra

139
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,881
as food for compensation.

140
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,059
So he's...the successor?

141
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,024
That was unfortunate, Zaku.

142
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,360
Why'd that happen to Zaku's arms?

143
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,239
Probably, that guy called
Shino or whatever...

144
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,992
exploited the opening and
stuck those bugs

145
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,995
into the exhaust opening in Zaku's hands.

146
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,249
If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave
in that condition,

147
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:08,880
the energy with no way out
would expand in search of an exit...

148
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,802
His arms that are
gun barrels blow up...

149
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,763
and become useless.

150
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:29,567
Our relationship was only that
of having been given the same mission...

151
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,864
but...I'll even the score for you.

152
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,663
Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed...

153
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,747
What?! What?!

154
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:47,919
So Shino, you were that strong,
weren't you?! Dang it!

155
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,548
I thought he was
a creepy person from long before, but...

156
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,883
Oh...

157
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,473
S-Shino, good...work...

158
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,225
Hey, you did it!

159
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,436
Yes... I'm counting on you guys, too.

160
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,862
He comes back like he's
the team leader or something! Dang it!

161
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,493
Umm, now then, I would like to
get right to the next match.

162
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,332
Kakashi Sensei!

163
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,417
Yo!

164
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,420
Not, "Yo!" Kakashi Sensei!

165
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,381
What about Sasuke? Is he okay?

166
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,300
Well, he's fine.

167
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,135
He's sleeping soundly in the infirmary.

168
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,348
However, with Anbu Ops standing as guards...

169
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,808
Oh.

170
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,769
Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro

171
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,231
It's finally my turn.

172
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:55,194
Kankuro, he's totally underestimating this...

173
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,614
Humph. Idiot...

174
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,840
It's him...!

175
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:29,520
Unlike Yoroi, I don't get
careless with kids at all.

176
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:36,569
I'll say this first, once I do my technique...

177
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,113
give up no matter what...

178
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,991
I'll bring it to an end swiftly.

179
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,035
If so, I'll also...

180
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,415
bring it to an end swiftly!

181
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,216
Now then, please begin...

182
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,176
the third battle!

183
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:10,478
Hey, can you hear it?

184
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:17,568
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

185
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:26,786
The ocean spans limitlessly

186
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:35,920
Please keep that smile on your face forever

187
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:43,386
Or else I'll cry

188
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,557
You won't have to search around you

189
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,436
It's all ok now.

190
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,858
Everyone is inside

191
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,319
this hand

192
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:05,408
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

193
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,954
When you forget what happiness is

194
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,000
Just sing.

195
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,172
Light is born, and darkness was born

196
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,424
The two are one

197
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,676
Harmonia,

198
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,264
feel the telepathy

199
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,853
Hey, can you hear it?

200
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,319
I believed in your words the whole time.

201
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,945
I wanted to be like you.

202
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,406
I thought it would be nice
if that happened.

203
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,701
So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.

204
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,412
I'm no longer like I was before.

205
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,875
There's no point if I don't
exceed the serious you.

206
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:01,089
Next episode: "Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious!"

207
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,757
Let's have a fair fight.
