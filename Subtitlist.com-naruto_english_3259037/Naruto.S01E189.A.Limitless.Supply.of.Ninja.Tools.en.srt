1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,212
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,970
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,540
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,545
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,302
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,931
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:12,656
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:35,930
A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools

16
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:55,658
Naruto!

17
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,540
Naruto!

18
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,214
You've come back, Choji!

19
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,549
Yay!

20
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,802
Are you okay, Naruto!

21
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm okay, but I'm not okay
with your heavy weight!

22
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,641
I'll get him right away!

23
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,398
Stop it Choji!
It doesn't work on him!

24
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,070
What?

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,579
This water absorbs all the shocks and
it gives me an iron-wall defense.

26
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,955
Oh, really?

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,041
Shoot!

28
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,044
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!

29
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,639
I'm saved.

30
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,891
Where'd that guy go?!

31
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,817
After a bonfire, you should put it out.

32
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,467
There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,

33
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,012
but my water that the earth
gives me is infinite.

34
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,350
His Ninjutsu is endless.
So for now...

35
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,519
Wanna run away?
Say that you'll withdraw!

36
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,196
You can't get away.

37
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,201
Summoning Jutsu!

38
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
After them!

39
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,768
This way!

40
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,315
If you get caught by that water,
it's over for sure!

41
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,651
It's coming around from
this side too.

42
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,361
It's trying to trap us!

43
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,159
Run! Run! You're all going to
get eaten if you get caught!

44
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,079
At this rate, we're eventually
going to be defeated.

45
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,082
Looks like we've gotta beat him up,
after all.

46
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,377
But how are we going to beat him
if the attack doesn't work on him?

47
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,890
Damn!

48
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,769
Huh?

49
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,399
Don't you think
there's something weird about him?

50
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,531
Wh-What is?

51
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,824
Hmm... I wonder?

52
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,784
Don't be joking at a time like this!

53
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,664
Perhaps, is Naruto talking
about his tonfa?

54
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,752
Oh yeah, he's holding his tonfa
like a dowsing rod.

55
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,003
That's it!

56
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,921
It's called dousing.

57
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,007
If you concentrate on the item
you're looking for,

58
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,470
it will react to that item and inform you
when you get near it.

59
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,138
Dowsing?

60
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,141
I see! Naruto, Choji!

61
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,643
We might have a chance to win!

62
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,853
Huh?

63
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,273
If that tonfa is the secret of
this Jutsu then...

64
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,150
Naruto!

65
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,779
Let's rap up the chase!

66
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,947
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,367
Idiot.

68
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm not going to let you get away!

69
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,300
I've got you!

70
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,692
Seems like you tried to get close to me,
but too bad

71
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,402
Damn it!

72
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,872
I'm going to prepare
a special one for you.

73
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,920
Wh-What Naruto?

74
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,214
Hurry up and run, Choji!

75
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,200
Yurinojou!

76
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,414
Yurinojou! Choji!

77
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,710
Choji!

78
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,304
Behind you!
Look behind you!

79
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,975
I said look behind you!

80
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,441
Choji!

81
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,449
Choji!

82
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,258
The fight is over.

83
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,470
First, the big one,
I'll eat you first.

84
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,889
Certainly the fight is over.

85
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,184
A fight where you're going to lose.
What?!

86
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,687
Right now Choji!
Drink up the water!

87
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,868
Useless, useless.

88
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,871
Water will gush out from the ground
with no limits.

89
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,583
Why isn't the water coming out?

90
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,505
Like I said, it's useless.

91
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,131
What happened?!

92
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,927
The water that will protect
you will not come out of here.

93
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,137
Look carefully at the surroundings..

94
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,184
Yes, water does not come out
of this craggy place.

95
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,025
I'm full!

96
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,034
Yurinojou has realized your secret.

97
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,122
I also thought something was strange.

98
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,874
When I went to check the trap,

99
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,545
I decided to take the shortest route
through the craggy area.

100
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,508
It wouldn't have been strange
to run into you there...

101
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,343
but that didn't happen.

102
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,554
The answer to that is easy!

103
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,223
You made a detour because
you avoided craggy areas

104
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,808
where the water wouldn't come out.

105
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,769
The tonfa you hold is a weapon

106
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,605
and was a way to find the water
through dowsing.

107
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,569
You lost them and you went away
from your advantageous places.

108
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,573
You mean... The reason why
you cracked my tonfa was...

109
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,867
Of course, it wasn't a coincidence.

110
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,955
It was planned by Yurinojou who
calculated your actions.

111
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,290
Damn it...!

112
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,336
This one will be heavy because
of the water!

113
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,174
Human Boulder!

114
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,321
You did it! Choji!

115
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,950
Yurinojou!

116
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:03,955
My ribs are injured, but...
I'm okay.

117
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,543
But there should be three of them,
so hurry and get the princess!

118
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,878
I got it!

119
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,589
Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.

120
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,801
Okay!
I'll catch up to Hinata!

121
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,600
Let me rest a little.

122
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,645
I got it.

123
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,730
Let's wait for everyone here.

124
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,114
There's no need to wait.

125
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,576
After we rest a little, you are going
to take me to a safe place.

126
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,037
But Naruto and the others are not yet...

127
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,956
That doesn't matter!

128
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,042
In the first place, everything became
like this because of you guys.

129
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,627
Instead of taking the long way,

130
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,588
if we had used the merchant people
as decoys,

131
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,466
then we would have escaped by now!

132
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,053
Decoys...?
But Kikusuke has already...

133
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,555
What about it?

134
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,435
If your mission as Ninja is to risk
your life in the line of duty,

135
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,562
then Kikunojou should be satisfied.

136
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,439
Even though Kikunojou is dead,

137
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,025
if I am still alive, then it's possible to
revive the Land of the Green.

138
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,694
Princess.
Hinata,

139
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:21,491
you won't understand how
I was separated from my parents

140
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,410
to be held as hostage in
a foreign country

141
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,872
and how much I was bullied.

142
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:33,837
I realized then that only fools would expect
to live off of human compassion.

143
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,881
Especially someone like Naruto

144
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,300
who is easily influenced by
people's emotions

145
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,135
should be disqualified as a Ninja.

146
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,346
He loses his rationality in his goal.

147
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,017
Princess, what do you know
about Naruto?

148
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,521
Naruto has lived without his parents
since he was a child.

149
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,357
He has always lived alone.

150
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,278
To be accepted by everyone,
to become the next Hokage...

151
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,614
he has worked hard...really hard...

152
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,991
Despite all that, he didn't give up

153
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,205
and he would never think of
living at the expense of others.

154
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,707
He tried and tried.

155
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,460
Naruto and I are in different positions.

156
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,923
I'm sorry. You're right, Princess.

157
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,054
Hinata... Do you like Naruto?

158
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,393
I understand.
Let's wait for everyone here.

159
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,728
Princess...

160
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,981
That bag must be heavy.
I will relieve you of some of the burden.

161
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,025
Oh, thanks.

162
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,786
I cannot die in a place like this.

163
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,757
Don't you look nice, Ruiga.

164
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,554
Jiga... Help me... Brother...

165
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,305
Whatever.

166
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:13,937
If you die, Brother Renga and I could
split the Land of Green's profits.

167
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,230
Jiga...

168
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,856
Don't blame me.

169
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,775
W-Wait!

170
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,784
S-Stop Jiga...!

171
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,354
Hinata!

172
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,567
Hinata.

173
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,905
N-Naruto...

174
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,285
Where is the Princess?

175
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,121
That's what I was going to ask!

176
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,958
I said let's wait here and the minute
I turned around...

177
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,420
Why does a Ninja like you
get beaten by an amateur?

178
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,673
S-Sorry.

179
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,760
Then right now she should be alone...

180
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,013
Naruto, we should first go back
to the village

181
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,890
and get advice from the Hokage.

182
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,976
No!
There's no time for that.

183
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,563
There are still two Janin left.

184
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,650
She'll get killed if she gets caught.

185
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,236
But this really isn't an official mission.

186
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,990
We might not be able to
handle the other two...

187
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,575
You're right...

188
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,956
As you say, this may not be
an official mission but...

189
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:02,629
she's trying really hard to escape
by herself right now.

190
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,634
The things she says and does
may be wrong,

191
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,553
but somehow,
I can't leave her alone.

192
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,890
Naruto, I'll also...
Hinata!

193
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,227
Yurinojou got hurt.

194
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,314
You and Choji,
please take care of Yurinojou!

195
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,108
See you later!

196
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,488
Be careful, Naruto...

197
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,711
Right there!

198
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,924
I see, you have good instincts.

199
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,593
I'll praise you for getting Ruiga.

200
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,101
Are you the second Janin?

201
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, I feel honored that you know
about me.

202
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,818
Then you should brag about it
in the other world.

203
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,196
That Mr. Jiga killed you,
so it couldn't be helped.

204
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,537
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

205
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,793
What?

206
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,838
That wouldn't work.

207
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:35,555
This guy...
What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?

208
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,977
A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh?
How interesting.

209
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,521
I'll put them down as
one of my next targets.

210
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,943
I won't let you do that!

211
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,822
How did...?

212
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,579
Yup.

213
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,832
My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.

214
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,512
It's like this!

215
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,249
I will live, no matter what...

216
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,803
This is your graveyard.

217
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,765
I will return those words
right back at you.

218
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,894
You! Then.

219
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,856
There!

220
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,197
Damn!
What's going on?!

221
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,706
What should I do?
I can't find Choji.

222
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm sure that he's somewhere
hiding his presence, but...

223
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,514
This is... Naruto's forehead band.

224
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,436
Naruto...

225
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,482
I grew up drinking iron.

226
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,986
That's why I can use the iron

227
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,197
that has accumulated in my body
and turn myself into a magnet.

228
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,327
This rocky mountain contains
lots of iron,

229
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,954
making it my invincible battle-field.

230
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,749
Change yourself into magnet...?

231
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,670
By the way, I could also change
the things I touch into magnets.

232
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:17,300
I've already changed the rocks behind you
into powerful magnets.

233
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,179
So what are you trying to do?!

234
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:26,309
I mean this!
Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!

235
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,688
Second hit! Third hit!

236
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,985
Naruto!

237
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,659
Your friend... I'll take good care of her.

238
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,332
Hinata! Don't come!

239
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,377
He is...

240
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,131
He is...a dangerous...opponent...

241
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,763
Naruto!

242
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:15,441
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

243
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,323
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

244
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,714
Yellow Moon.

245
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:44,554
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

246
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,851
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

247
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:56,733
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

248
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:03,740
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

249
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:10,371
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

250
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:17,086
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

251
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,926
A magical chord change, in a restless city

252
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:30,933
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

253
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,607
What should I do?

254
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,568
My Gentle Fist won't work against
his Ninja Art.

255
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,863
It's frustrating, but I can't win against him
if I fight him head on.

256
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,365
At this rate, Naruto will...

257
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,910
No, no, I won't let that happen.

258
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,829
I will discover the weakness
of his Jutsu.

259
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,501
I won't give up!
I'll stop him, no matter what!

260
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,088
Next time:
"The Byakugan Sees the Blind Spot!"

261
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,256
I'm going to risk everything
in this single attack!
