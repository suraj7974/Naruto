1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,141
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,356
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,862
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,366
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:40,416
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,794
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,131
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,926
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

16
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,903
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,156
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,118
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,747
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,250
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,797
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,892
Sasuke...?

23
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,354
No... Who is he?

24
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,148
He's got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.

25
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,026
Really...

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,862
who'd believe a kid like you to
have the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.

27
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,285
Why does that guy know
about the Nine-Tailed Fox?!

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,540
Naruto, you will come with us.

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,963
Roar, Chidori! Brother vs. Brother!

30
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,886
That guy is...close by!

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,640
That guy!

32
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,826
Elder Brother...

33
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,120
Today...

34
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,124
when school's over,
help me train for a Shuriken Jutsu...

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,543
I'm busy...

36
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,421
Have father teach you.

37
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,718
But you're better at Shuriken Jutsu,
Elder Brother...

38
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,970
Even I can see that.

39
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,808
You always treat me
like a pest, Elder Brother.

40
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,112
Ouch!

41
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,782
Forgive me Sasuke...

42
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,910
Some other time, okay?

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,677
I don't have time to
pay attention to you today.

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,060
You're always jabbing my forehead
and saying "Forgive me, Sasuke."

45
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,355
You also say "not today,"
but there's never a day.

46
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,201
-Father.
-Huh?

47
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,913
Why doesn't Elder Brother
pay any attention to me?

48
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,211
That guy's a little strange...

49
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:17,675
He's the type that doesn't really like
to become intimate with people.

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,343
Why?

51
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,304
I don't know.

52
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,890
I am his father

53
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:29,103
and still I can't read that boy...

54
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,939
Here! Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!

55
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,108
If you're worried about doing
Shuriken Jutsu practice,

56
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,318
I will watch you when you get home.

57
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,365
They're not practices, they're training!

58
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,034
See you later!

59
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,334
-Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
-Yes.

60
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,047
I saw Itachi earlier on.
He's really become a man.

61
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,425
He's already a top-notch Shinobi.

62
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,803
He graduated at the head of his class
at the Academy at the age of seven,

63
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,514
and attained Chunin level
at the age of ten, didn't he?

64
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,643
He became adept at using
Sharingan at the age of eight.

65
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,439
Yes, I remember.

66
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,651
That boy is truly
the pride of the Uchiha clan.

67
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,697
By the way, how old are you now, Sasuke?

68
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,037
I'm the same age as
when Elder Brother graduated,

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,163
but I can't...

70
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,124
-What's the matter?
-Hey!

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,419
Stop talking nonsense!

72
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,087
Oh my, dear.

73
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,550
Sasuke, both you and Itachi
come from the same Uchiha clan,

74
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,510
the pedigree of the Hidden Leaf Village.

75
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,554
Have confidence!

76
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,808
You'll be an amazing
Shinobi just like Itachi one day.

77
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,019
Yeah!

78
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,479
See you later!

79
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,355
Do your best!

80
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,775
Study hard!

81
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,994
That's right...

82
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:12,414
I come from the same Uchiha clan
as Elder Brother...

83
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,258
I won't lose to Elder Brother!

84
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,815
I'm pretty late...

85
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,720
What was that?
I had the feeling there was someone there...

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,187
The lights are out.
Even though it's not time for bed...

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,861
What's this?!

88
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,748
W-What's this?!

89
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,382
What in the world is this?!

90
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,063
Uncle... Auntie...

91
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,778
Father... Mother...!

92
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,291
Father? Mother?

93
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,586
Aren't you here?

94
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,413
There's somebody here!

95
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,340
Move!

96
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,759
Move!

97
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,303
Move!

98
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,193
Father! Mother!

99
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,637
Elder Brother!

100
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,598
Elder Brother! Father and Mother are...!

101
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,184
Why? For what reason?!

102
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,104
Who in the world would do
something like this...?

103
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,986
Elder Brother... What are you...?

104
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,839
What are you doing, Elder Brother!

105
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,301
Foolish little brother...

106
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,769
Mangekyo Sharingan!

107
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,662
My legs...!

108
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,885
Stop!

109
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,223
Elder Brother! Don't make me see this!

110
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,601
Why...?

111
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,145
Why did you, Elder Brother...?!

112
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,688
No...!

113
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,108
No...

114
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,241
Auntie! Uncle!

115
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,623
Father! Mother!

116
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,208
Stop it! Elder Brother!

117
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,086
Don't kill Father and Mother!

118
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,841
W-Why...

119
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,804
Why did you...? Elder Brother...?

120
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,645
To measure my abilities...

121
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,316
Measure your abilities...?

122
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,195
Just for that?

123
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,450
Are you saying that...

124
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,120
Just for that... you killed them all?

125
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,958
That is of great importance.

126
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,296
What do you mean...?

127
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,469
Don't talk rubbish!

128
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,376
I'm scared...

129
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,461
I'm scared!

130
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,645
Don't kill me...!

131
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,705
D-Don't kill me!

132
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,459
You are not even worth killing...

133
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,879
Foolish little brother...

134
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,843
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!

135
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,927
Hate me!

136
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,849
And keep on surviving in
that unsightly manner...

137
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:56,146
Just continue fleeing and fleeing
and hang onto your life!

138
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,794
Shall we go outside...?

139
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,132
These guys aren't just anybody...

140
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,100
Itachi, it'll be a pain in the neck
if this kid moves around and...

141
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,021
Maybe I better chop off
a leg just in case...

142
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,524
W-What did he say?!

143
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:48,990
Now then...

144
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,338
Long time no see...

145
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,302
Sasuke.

146
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,223
Itachi Uchiha!

147
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,726
Itachi...Uchiha?

148
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,734
The same as Sasuke... An Uchiha...

149
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,033
Huh...Sharingan...

150
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,744
And moreover, he resembles you a lot...

151
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,373
Who the heck is he?

152
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,961
He's my younger brother.

153
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,843
But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan
had been murdered.

154
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,221
By you.

155
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,061
Itachi Uchiha...I will kill you!

156
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,737
I must kill one certain man without fail!

157
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,656
That man...

158
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,785
My elder brother...

159
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,163
I thought I couldn't die...

160
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,836
without killing him, but...

161
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,299
That's the guy that Sasuke was saying ...

162
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,509
The man he wanted to kill...

163
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,320
It's just as you said...

164
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,699
I held a grudge against you and hated you.

165
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,536
For the singular purpose of
killing you, I...

166
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,416
I...

167
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,377
have lived my life!

168
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,463
Sasuke...!

169
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,178
Chidori...?

170
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,139
I will kill you!

171
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,066
Die!

172
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,761
W-What's going on?!

173
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,390
I can't believe that Sasuke's Jutsu
was so easily thwarted...

174
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,309
This doesn't look good!

175
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,437
I've got to do something!

176
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,028
Chakra permeates the air...

177
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,033
I see...
So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!

178
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,119
-You jerk!
-You're in the way!

179
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,081
Sasuke!

180
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,375
Darn it!

181
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,752
-Ninja Art: Summo...
-You're too slow!

182
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,425
Huh...? I can't feel the Chakra...

183
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,387
Darn! Darn! Why is it?!

184
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,682
My sword Shark Skin has the ability to...

185
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,311
cut through and eat Chakra!

186
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,108
It's a pain in the butt

187
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,360
if the kid moves around
and uses Jutsu like that...

188
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,821
Before these legs...

189
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,949
Should I chop off these arms?

190
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,581
Why doesn't it emerge?!

191
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,374
It's pointless...

192
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,684
What?

193
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:40,031
You guys just don't know me much, do you?

194
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,450
This man Jiraiya

195
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,953
does not fall victim
to any woman's allurement,

196
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,039
but rather his forte is
winning women's affection!

197
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:53,252
I'm not made to blindly follow after
a woman's feminine charm!

198
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,755
When you get to my level,

199
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,633
women yelp with delight

200
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,511
at my sex appeal!

201
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,314
A cycle of hardship, right?

202
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,194
Inside, we were crying, right?

203
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,826
But the one thing we won't give up

204
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

205
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,415
It's a secondary role,

206
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,712
a role in the shadows

207
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

208
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,557
let us stay centered, let us stay true

209
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,311
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

210
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:57,025
Over and over, we kept coming back up

211
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,738
Over and over,

212
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,160
we believed and dreamed

213
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,582
Over and over, we've seen fools

214
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:18,046
Over and over, we've stood in the shadows of others

215
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,216
Now, it's our turn...

216
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,181
Let us bask in our dreams

217
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,608
Watch out, Sasuke!

218
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,818
Naruto, don't help him.

219
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,570
But...Sasuke is!

220
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,281
It is your duty to watch

221
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,702
through this battle, Naruto.

222
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,954
-What?!
-This is his fight...

223
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,041
This represents everything

224
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,627
that he has been carrying up to now.

225
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,254
Next time:

226
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,631
"Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan!"
