1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,438
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,276
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,821
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:44,712
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,383
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,511
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,686
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,106
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,234
In time, we'll realize

13
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:11,280
that it was everything

14
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,742
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,412
creating a river of tears

16
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

17
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,005
and melting away

18
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,980
The Beast Within

19
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,823
Sasuke!

20
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,033
Why...?!

21
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,994
Why do you run away?!

22
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,872
Sasuke!

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,898
Don't...

24
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,859
be staring at...

25
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,278
people!

26
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,788
He's faster than earlier!

27
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,881
The medicine from earlier...

28
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,843
Was there some kind of
special ingredient in it or something...?

29
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,806
Not...bad...

30
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:09,189
Moving around kind of...
made me feel super weird...

31
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,482
Oh, my...!

32
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,952
What was that...all of a sudden...?

33
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,417
Did he really...fall asleep...?

34
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,470
You fell for it, eh?!

35
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:48,687
It looked like I was sleeping,
but actually I wasn't!

36
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,024
This is the Shinobi secret...!

37
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,946
Guy Sensei...I did it!

38
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:06,246
Guy Sensei...I...I...

39
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,181
You fell for it yet again, huh?!
Hey!

40
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:30,688
You're sorely mistaken
if you think I'm the kind of person

41
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,731
to sleep spread-eagle
in a place like this!

42
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,611
I...I...

43
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,072
What...?

44
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:46,704
What am I doing
in a place like this...?

45
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,420
What...?

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,048
Why...? Why...?

47
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,104
Alcohol...?

48
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,691
He's just drunk, huh...?

49
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:22,448
If so...I'll send you to another world
before you can even feel pain...

50
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,191
Damn it...
I don't have enough Chakra...

51
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,359
At this rate...

52
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,759
As might be expected,
things will get hairy

53
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,177
if I stay in the water any longer
with this wound...

54
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,326
Why won't it hit?!

55
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,206
And here I was sleeping comfortably...

56
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,253
You're a buzzing, annoying fly!

57
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:53,098
Hey! Bring it on! Hey c'mon...
I'll show you...

58
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,561
What're...those movements...?

59
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,815
As you know, in that technique...

60
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,736
one gets stronger the more one drinks
and the more one gets drunk.

61
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,698
I know...

62
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,867
At the restaurant before...

63
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,914
When Lee mistook it for water
and drank a small cup of alcohol...

64
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:37,935
It took Neji and me, the both of us,
to finally...be able to overpower Lee.

65
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,690
You couldn't restrain him yourself...?

66
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,778
I could overpower him
if I was fighting him as an enemy...

67
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,574
But well, I couldn't inflict a serious injury
on my beloved student...

68
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,576
That's right...

69
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,163
That's how it was
just with one small cup, so...

70
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,626
If he were to drink
an entire bottle of alcohol...

71
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,712
An invincible strength, huh...?

72
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,633
But it's just after
he got out of the hospital.

73
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,678
How long will his body
hold on for...?

74
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,525
A Loopy Fist User, huh...?
It's my first time seeing one...

75
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:32,698
If you're not going to come...
then I'll go!

76
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,161
His attacks are straight as usual...

77
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,664
Oh!

78
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,212
Ouch!

79
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,173
It's your fault!

80
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,022
I...I...!

81
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,567
I'm enjoying my youth!

82
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,906
He's too unorthodox...

83
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,784
And most of all...he's fast!

84
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,455
Right in the middle of my youth...

85
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,757
Dance of the Camellia!

86
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,973
Here!

87
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,852
I can't read his movements...

88
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:31,483
An attack on me...
That's quite some Taijutsu...

89
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,070
I have no choice...

90
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,376
My attack ability is bones...

91
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,213
You heard that earlier
from the Clone brat, right...?

92
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,510
I'll sober you up right away.

93
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,597
I'm...not drunk...or anything!

94
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,518
Then I'll wake you up!

95
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm not drunk or anything!

96
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,025
In the first place, I'm a minor!

97
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,905
Minors shouldn't drink at all!

98
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:38,091
Unorthodox, isn't it...?
This is my Kekkei Genkai.

99
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:04,659
Calm down...Think of a strategy...

100
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,248
Seek...some kind of possibility...

101
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,930
Humph. With that wound...

102
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,934
It seems he wasn't able
to escape very far at all...

103
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,862
This is my limit...
I can't move...

104
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,499
Damn it...
He's already caught up?

105
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,210
And...

106
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,483
My head's pounding...

107
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,944
And what's with this wound...?

108
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,239
It seems I was drunk, eh...?

109
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,201
Your appearance...!

110
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:34,874
It seems you've sobered up...
This is my Kekkei Genkai...

111
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,877
Kekkei Genkai...

112
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:45,427
My Kekkei Genkai freely controls
osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells...

113
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:51,725
It even controls the concentration
of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.

114
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:56,813
Basically, there are over two hundred
bones in the human body...

115
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,067
But for me, that's not a set number.

116
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,036
But bones are bones, after all!

117
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,246
If they break, they break!

118
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,630
Wh-What a hardness...!

119
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,009
Are these really human bones...?!

120
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:29,971
If so...!

121
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,933
Larch Dance.

122
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,753
I've had it...

123
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,466
A little more...you clod.

124
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,136
It's not like the time before with Asuma...

125
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,276
A-Asuma!

126
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:32,992
There's probably zero possibility
of someone coming to help...

127
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,747
Hey, what's the point of thinking
about someone helping...?!

128
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,749
Calm down!

129
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,388
The smell is moving away...

130
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm saved...

131
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,478
Who is?

132
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,232
How...?!

133
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,485
I knew it...

134
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,280
My coat?!

135
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:58,244
It seems you didn't notice your own smell
that you're routinely used to smelling...

136
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,749
With that you erased your own smell?

137
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,295
You understand well the attributes of scent.

138
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,423
It figures why I didn't smell you.

139
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,635
And...as would be expected,

140
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,013
it's tough having you guys split up in two
to search for me...

141
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
Damn it...

142
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,653
Please wait!

143
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,990
The real deal...is from now!

144
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,499
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible...

145
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:49,170
So, I should've avoided a big technique
that could be self-defeating...

146
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,841
But it seems this isn't an opponent
easy enough to be able to beat

147
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,134
without using my Secret Technique...

148
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,347
Here I go!

149
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,935
I just had surgery
and am not at my best.

150
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,939
But if it'd just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,

151
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,023
I should somehow...

152
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,988
The first gate... Gate of Opening...

153
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,573
Open!

154
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,077
Primary Lotus!

155
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,545
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones...?!

156
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:35,508
That's some speed... But it's over.

157
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:41,723
Damn it... No matter how much I think,
I can't come up with any good strategies!

158
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,185
I've had it...can't hold any further...

159
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,026
With me right in front of you,
you can't even howl like a loser...?

160
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,111
Eh?!

161
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,616
Die!

162
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,951
You're mine!

163
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,204
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!

164
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,508
What?!

165
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,434
Who're you?!

166
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,486
Heh... It seems
you're an ally this time...

167
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,162
Who're you?!

168
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,581
A Sand...

169
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,042
Shinobi...

170
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,044
ally of the Leaf!

171
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,272
For the first time, I spoke to you

172
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,609
And you smiled

173
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,861
For the first time, I was able to speak

174
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,364
In my own words

175
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:27,453
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

176
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:32,709
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

177
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:38,798
My clumsy attempts with words

178
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:44,303
You listened without turning away

179
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:50,852
No wonder I get carried away by you

180
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:55,648
But you don't feel anything for me,

181
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,984
do you?

182
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,737
I feel so sad

183
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,821
But...

184
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,073
For the first time, I spoke to you

185
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,452
And you smiled

186
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,746
For the first time, I was able to speak

187
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,082
In my own words

188
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,376
For the first time, I spoke to you

189
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,755
And you smiled

190
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,007
For the first time, I was able to speak

191
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,260
In my own words

192
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,057
For the first time, I spoke to you

193
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,234
I heard that the Sand and Leaf
had made up, but...

194
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,737
It wasn't that we attacked the Leaf Village
for the fun of it.

195
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,156
It was just a mission, same as this time.

196
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,741
Humph! I see.

197
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,536
By the way, weren't you three
headed this way together?

198
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,207
We had no choice.
Since you guys are weak...

199
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,628
Idiot. Don't take them lightly.
These guys are out of the ordinary.

200
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,964
