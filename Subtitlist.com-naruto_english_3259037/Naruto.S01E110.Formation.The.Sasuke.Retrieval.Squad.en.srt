1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,025
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,456
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,178
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,183
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:04,231
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,322
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:18,412
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,338
and melting away

14
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,393
Don't forget your objective...

15
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,023
Don't go!

16
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,944
Thank you...

17
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,907
Sasuke...

18
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:06,085
Formation!
The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!

19
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,049
It's already four o'clock
in the morning...

20
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,219
That Fifth Hokage is
a real slave driver.

21
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,972
She ought to retrieve
the documents she forgot herself...

22
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,228
Huh... What's the matter?

23
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,692
Hey! Wake up!

24
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,944
You'll catch cold if you sleep
in a place like this.

25
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,867
Thank you...

26
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,828
Huh! Sasuke!

27
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,065
Good work...

28
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,446
Fifth Hokage! You were asleep
just now, weren't you?

29
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,656
When you made us
go to fetch the documents!

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,867
And only you got to sleep!

31
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,787
More importantly, Lady Hokage,

32
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,205
there's something
I want to report to you.

33
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,166
What is it?

34
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,838
What did you just say?! Is that true?!

35
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,715
Yes...

36
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,802
According to Sakura Haruno,
it appears that there's no mistake...

37
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,225
Unbelievable...
That they should already be on the move...

38
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,688
In addition to getting what I want...

39
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:55,235
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village.

40
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,740
So what that pervert wants...

41
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,910
is the Uchiha's powers, huh...

42
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,581
Izumo! Kotetsu!

43
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,084
There's somebody
I want you to bring here!

44
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:17,633
Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!
Your Dad's mission starts today, too!

45
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,928
There's not that much time
for morning training!

46
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,012
OK, OK.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,139
One OK is enough!

48
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,686
Nag, nag, nag from early
in the morning...

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,231
I wonder who it could be
so early in the morning?

50
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,527
Hey...Dad...

51
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,362
What is it?

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,115
Why did you marry
a hard-edged woman like Mom?

53
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,618
Let's see now...

54
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,414
Even though Mom's like that,
she smiles gently sometimes...

55
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,624
Maybe that's why...

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,130
Is that the only reason?

57
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,591
Shikamaru!

58
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,012
A messenger of the Fifth Hokage
is here.

59
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,770
Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out
of the village late last night.

60
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,273
And...there is almost no mistake

61
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,942
that he is headed for
the Village Hidden in the Sound!

62
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,570
Slipped out?! Why...

63
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,532
Because he was enticed by
that Orochimaru!

64
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,746
W-W-Wait a minute!

65
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,708
Why does Sasuke have to be enticed
by a risky guy like that?!

66
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,755
The reason doesn't matter.
In any case, there's no time.

67
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,176
You will perform your first mission
as a Chunin...

68
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,846
So all I have to do
is bring Sasuke back?

69
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,015
As long as there aren't
any enemies around,

70
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,392
that shouldn't be
too much of a hassle...

71
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:56,482
Yes... However, not only is time
of the essence on this mission,

72
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,859
but it may turn into something
quite difficult.

73
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,194
Huh?!

74
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,905
There is a strong possibility that

75
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,783
those under the control of Orochimaru
are guiding Sasuke.

76
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,495
This is turning into a real pain
in the neck.

77
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,414
That guy...

78
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:17,795
I held him in high respect
in so many different ways...

79
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,133
In that case, please give me
a four-man team

80
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,469
composed only of Jonin and Chunin.

81
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm afraid I can't do that...

82
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,390
Huh! Why?!

83
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,559
You already know
the answer to that...

84
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:39,691
Right now, only the barest minimum
number of Jonin have been left behind

85
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,860
and the others have all
left the village on missions.

86
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,949
Within the next 30 minutes,

87
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:51,453
I want you to gather all the Genin you
consider the best, and leave this village!

88
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,298
It's a drag but...

89
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,468
I know the guy,
so I just can't just let the matter go.

90
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,264
What shall be, shall be...

91
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:18,021
There's one guy
I want to recommend.

92
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,440
What! You've gotta be kidding!

93
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,654
You are such a drag starting
so early in the morning...

94
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,158
But why this guy?

95
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,830
That jerk!

96
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,416
Hey, just wait here!

97
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,042
I'll change my clothes immediately!

98
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,798
So, do you have your eye...

99
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,176
on any other guys besides me
who are excellent?

100
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,802
Yeah...

101
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,264
Wake up! Hey!

102
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,433
You said excellent guys, right...

103
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,227
Can't be helped...

104
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,524
Potato chips?

105
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,987
They're barbecued meat flavor...
you help out too!

106
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,071
Huh?!

107
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,705
Here he comes!

108
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
Even if it is just potato chips,

109
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,421
I won't let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.

110
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,385
Choji and I have worked as
a team for many years,

111
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,846
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

112
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,600
I understand that,

113
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,229
but in this kind of situation,
one would normally solicit Shino first!

114
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,356
Oh, shut up.

115
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,323
Fat chance...!

116
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,295
Shino is on a special mission
with his father.

117
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,131
Hey...don't tell me...

118
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,383
Right. He's in.

119
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,759
No way...!

120
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,057
I see... Sounds interesting...

121
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,394
It looks like it was worth getting up early
and going for a walk, doesn't it?

122
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,437
Shikamaru, what about the other guys?

123
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,566
I'd like to take my time to look for some,
but we're pressed for time.

124
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,113
If we don't find anybody else
by the time we leave the village,

125
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,823
it will be just us!

126
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,826
It appears that your operation
was a success.

127
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,494
Yeah...

128
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,746
Is it okay for you
to be released already?

129
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:44,584
I was told that I would be able
to undertake light training soon.

130
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,712
I see...

131
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,353
It's a hassle,
but the more people the better...

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,818
Damn... At a time like this, I...

133
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,283
Lee! Do what you need to do.

134
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,015
I'll climb these steps alone
starting tomorrow!

135
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,017
Lee...

136
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,022
I'll be fine! You go!

137
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,532
We're at our time limit!

138
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,249
Well, I've assembled five people...

139
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,342
All right! Everybody, follow me!

140
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,765
Hey...

141
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,850
Hey, Naruto...

142
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,771
I'm supposed to be the squad leader.
Though it sure is a drag...

143
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,317
You really think everything will be okay
if things are left in your hands?

144
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,236
You don't seem very reliable...

145
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,074
What's up with you acting
like the boss, Naruto?

146
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,494
Although being ordered about by
some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru

147
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,080
doesn't sit right with me either...

148
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,126
But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!

149
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,545
We have to follow his orders.

150
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,215
What that means is that
the elders of the village recognized him

151
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,967
as capable of being a leader.

152
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,681
Since that's the case,
come up with some strategy and plan.

153
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,933
From what I heard,
there are enemies

154
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,227
and there's a strong possibility
that they're gonna ambush us.

155
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,814
For a start,
as this is a rescue operation,

156
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,983
we will be in the position
of pursuit.

157
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,695
In other words,
the enemy can easily gain the initiative.

158
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,366
Therefore, I will decide
on a deployment formation

159
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,368
that will respond quickly
to any assault by the enemy.

160
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,746
If you ignore me and
move of your own accord,

161
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,665
we will all die.

162
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,046
We will go in a single file formation.

163
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,550
First of all,
the all-important spearhead will be...

164
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,803
Kiba, that's you!

165
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,932
You and Akamaru go on
walks year round

166
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,810
and are therefore well-versed in the terrain
and geography of the Land of Fire.

167
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,729
And since your nose is
very sensitive,

168
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,689
you can track Sasuke
with your sense of smell and,

169
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,275
you can distinguish booby traps
that carry the enemy's scent

170
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,526
which makes them
easy to find...

171
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,281
And moreover, you and Akamaru as
a pair will be extremely efficient

172
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,577
in compensating for the weakness
of a single file formation to assault.

173
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,207
And...second in line will be me,
the squad leader.

174
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,502
I can give orders
as required in any situation

175
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,837
from my position
directly behind Kiba

176
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,674
and can give orders to those behind me
using only hand signals.

177
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,553
And in the middle...
in the number three position is Naruto.

178
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,349
The middle position is
the best for you,

179
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,434
since you're capable
of executing quick moves

180
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,854
and are able to respond immediately
to anything in front or behind.

181
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,816
You're the cornerstone...
And you have Shadow Clone, too.

182
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,029
And fourth in line is Choji.

183
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,574
You. You don't have speed,

184
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,868
but your ability to strike is the best
among the squad members.

185
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,455
Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto
will launch a surprise attack

186
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,831
and I'll use you to launch
the deciding blow.

187
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,292
In other words, your role is
to attack the routed enemy.

188
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,212
And then, on the tail end
will be you, Neji...

189
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:02,676
You are assigned to
the most difficult position of rear lookout.

190
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,928
You will use your Byakugan
to constantly check

191
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,263
that there are no loopholes
in the ranks.

192
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,687
Got it? Take a careful look at this.

193
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,613
Use this diagram to verify
the radius of your assigned watch.

194
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,702
Kiba watches the front, I'm
responsible for a wide forward view,

195
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,624
Naruto watches left, Choji right,
and Neji...

196
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,086
Using your Byakugan,
you cover the entire area to the rear.

197
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,008
I want to familiarize myself
with our current military potential.

198
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,387
Let me check all the Ninja equipment
each of you currently has...

199
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,555
I will commit that
to memory straight away.

200
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,391
Any questions?

201
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,896
Even though he just assembled
his men a short while ago,

202
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,524
he's already created
the best possible formation...

203
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,696
If not, I want to tell you
the most important thing last.

204
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,871
Sasuke and I aren't close friends.

205
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,664
In fact, I don't particularly like him.

206
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,923
However, he is also a Shinobi belonging
to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

207
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,592
He is a comrade!

208
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,552
Therefore, I will put my life
on the line to help him!

209
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,846
That's the way
of the Leaf Village.

210
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,810
In this case, even I can't just sit back
and be a sluggard.

211
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,773
Because I am responsible
for your lives.

212
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,240
Wow... You're acting kind of
like a Chunin, aren't you?!

213
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,120
Okay then, as soon as he's checked
our Ninja tools, we'll depart.

214
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,456
Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.

215
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:09,010
Sasuke wouldn't fall victim
to that kind of guy's enticement...

216
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,512
He's already
a really powerful guy,

217
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:15,183
so he wouldn't need to do
that kind of thing! I guarantee it!

218
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,565
Damn... Why, Sasuke...?!

219
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,984
All right! Let's go!

220
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,111
Wait!

221
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,951
Sakura!

222
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,913
I heard the whole story
from Lady Hokage.

223
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,165
I'm sorry, but I can't take you along
on this mission.

224
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,462
Even you weren't able
to convince Sasuke, right?

225
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,552
All that can be done now is for us
to use force to convince him...

226
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,389
Sakura, your role in this has ended.

227
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,563
Which means, Sakura,
that you and Sasuke...?!

228
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,652
Sakura...

229
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,663
Naruto...

230
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,876
This is a...
once in a lifetime request...

231
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,673
Please bring...
please bring Sasuke back.

232
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,968
I couldn't do it!

233
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,723
I wasn't able to stop Sasuke!

234
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,561
At this point, the only person
who would be able to stop Sasuke...

235
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,646
who would be able to save him...

236
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,359
is you...Naruto...

237
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,540
You like Sasuke so much,
don't you, Sakura?

238
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:08,296
I understand to my very core

239
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,465
how painful it must be
for you right now, Sakura.

240
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,431
Sakura, there's one thing
I want to ask you.

241
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,557
Huh?

242
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,310
How do you feel about...Naruto?

243
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,982
Thwarting someone's love seems
to have become natural to him.

244
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,027
He actually seems to be enjoying
my suffering.

245
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,573
Naruto doesn't understand
the least thing about me.

246
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,116
He's just annoying.

247
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,632
Naruto...thank you...

248
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,637
I'll bring Sasuke back without fail!

249
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,973
I promise that on my life!

250
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,979
You always understood me...

251
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,941
You always helped me...

252
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,822
Naruto...

253
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,704
Hey, hey, Naruto!

254
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,416
You really think you're gonna be okay
saying that kind of thing?!

255
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,711
Sure! I will not go back on my word.

256
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,546
That's my Way of the Ninja!

257
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,258
All right! Let's hurry up and go!

258
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,470
We've lost a little time...
Let's hurry!

259
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,097
OK!

260
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,908
Naruto struck the pose of
a nice guy as he said that...

261
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,951
It'll all be all right now.

262
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,538
I'm positive...
I'm positive that it will all go well!

263
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,893
Master Sasuke... Around here will do,
don't you think?

264
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,228
We've already exited
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

265
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,190
What is that?

266
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,067
To tell you the truth,

267
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,570
Orochimaru has given us
one important task...

268
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,115
So...what is it?

269
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,095
It will be necessary for you
to die once...

270
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:19,153
Once in a long while, once in a while

271
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:24,951
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

272
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:30,748
Look like a mountain

273
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:40,008
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

274
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:46,431
The remnants of a person crying

275
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,226
Look like a mountain

276
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,398
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

277
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

278
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,739
Shake shake shake
Let's look

279
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

280
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:21,090
Look like a mountain

281
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,012
Look like a mountain

282
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,515
Look like a mountain

283
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,728
Look like a mountain

284
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,610
From here on up, there's more danger
of traps and ambushes.

285
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,861
– Stay alert and use all your senses.
– Roger that!

286
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,405
– Find the enemy before he gets you.
– You can count on me!

287
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,032
– And any signs of the enemy...
– Right!

288
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,076
Say, are you listening?!

289
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,536
Not to worry.
No matter who the enemy may be,

290
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,539
I'll thrash him with
my new technique!

291
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,001
I'm a fool to
even attempt to explain.

292
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:01,547
Next time:
"Sound vs. Leaf"
