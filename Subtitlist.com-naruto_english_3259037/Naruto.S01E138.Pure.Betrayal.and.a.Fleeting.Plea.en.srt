1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,465
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:37,181
Pure Betrayal,
and a Fleeting Plea!

22
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,317
Summoning Jutsu!

23
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,322
Naruto! Grab on!

24
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,660
Okay, pull him up!

25
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,329
There, eh?!

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,252
Damn! Was it a clone?!

27
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,840
Over here!
Counterattack, here it comes!

28
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,097
Rasengan, go!

29
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,933
What...?!
You little...!

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
Yes!

31
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,363
Be careful, Naruto!
There are two others hiding!

32
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,742
Hey, there they are!

33
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,704
Kagero!
Let's retreat for now!

34
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,123
Hold it!

35
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,963
Th-They're totally quick
at running away!

36
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,935
Naruto, why're you spacing out?!

37
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,104
Where's Sakura?

38
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,064
Oh! Oh, no!

39
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,025
Sakura!

40
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,487
Oh! Naruto...

41
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,450
Thank goodness!
You're okay, Sasame.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,746
Yes... Sasame's okay.

43
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,914
Sasame's totally okay.

44
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,542
What're you mad about?

45
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,552
Let's take a break here.

46
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,141
Sakura...Who's the cute girl?

47
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,101
Okay! That's close enough...

48
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,270
What's the deal...Sakura?

49
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,940
Okay, don't come any closer!

50
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:57,696
Wh-What... I'm only interested
in adult women!

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,158
You must not misunderstand...!
Don't misunderstand!

52
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,910
It's not a misunderstanding.

53
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,039
It seems Sakura's finally figured out
Pervy Sage's true nature!

54
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,000
I told you to stop calling me
a "Pervy Sage"!

55
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,919
Then you're the Lewd Sage!

56
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,382
Both of you stop it! Sasame's scared!

57
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,258
– Okay.
– Okay.

58
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,094
Jeez...

59
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,055
This girl is Sasame...

60
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,140
She's a Ninja from
the Land of Rice Paddies...

61
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,809
A member of the Fuma Clan.

62
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,561
She had her cousin taken away
by Orochimaru

63
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,063
and was looking for his hideout.

64
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,858
Right. And the Ninja just now
were after Sasame

65
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,277
in order to protect the secret
of the hideout!

66
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,781
Oh...With the Fuma Clan, huh?

67
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,241
Huh?! You know?

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,163
I had contact with Ninja in the town
who'd left the Fuma Clan.

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,836
What! So you were actually doing
some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!

70
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,587
I-I can't believe it...!

71
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,674
Well you see, when I went to
this nice-looking bar,

72
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,844
it just turned out to be their hideout.

73
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,597
What! So after all, you were just
hanging out with some girls, right?

74
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,226
You mustn't talk in a way that'll
lead to a misunderstanding!

75
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,353
Even Sakura who respects me will...

76
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,314
I've long since stopped respecting you!

77
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,526
I...I see...

78
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,945
Members of the Fuma Clan...?

79
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,824
Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki
or something...

80
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:27,995
Hanzaki and the others are traitors
who abandoned the clan.

81
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,329
Oh...

82
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,041
Did those people do something?

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,086
They were after my travel money,
so I taught them a lesson.

84
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,214
While at it, I attempted to ask them about
Orochimaru's hideout...

85
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,383
but they didn't know anything.

86
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:48,057
I can show you the way to
Orochimaru's hideout.

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,060
For real?!
Yes...

88
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,269
All right!

89
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,241
Your wound hasn't healed yet.
Don't push yourself.

90
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,619
Yes...but...

91
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,208
This is the entrance to
the Village Hidden in Sound.

92
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,835
Orochimaru's hideout is deep
in those mountains...

93
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:27,513
I bet Sasuke is
somewhere in those mountains...

94
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,766
Okay, at last!

95
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,351
Let's hurry!

96
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,644
Well, hold on...

97
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,314
Why?!

98
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,735
If we don't hurry, night will fall before
we arrive at Orochimaru's hideout...

99
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,112
That's right!

100
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,615
Sasuke is just a stone's throw away!
Pervy Sage!

101
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,993
If we're going to save him,
we should do it as soon as possible!

102
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,578
Why do we have to wait?!

103
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,833
Huh...?
What?

104
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,167
Gee...

105
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,505
Well...I'm hungry, you see...

106
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,842
You know... All Shinobi must ...

107
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,969
I can't fight if I'm hungry!

108
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,764
Up ahead will become full-blown
enemy territory.

109
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,143
We won't have time to
have relaxed meals, so...

110
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,272
Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!

111
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,946
Mm, this is good...

112
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,408
You prepared this especially for us?

113
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:35,873
No. It seems the prettiest girl
in the bar fell to my charm, you see.

114
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,504
She made these with tender loving care.

115
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,592
I'll go make some tea.

116
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,552
Oh...thanks...

117
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,450
Tastes pretty good.

118
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,079
Tea is ready.

119
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,375
Here you go!

120
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,670
Here you go.
Thanks...

121
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,341
Here you go.
Thank you, Sasame...

122
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,638
Sasame, you should come here
and eat with us, too.

123
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,722
Okay...

124
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,208
Pervy Sage...What's wrong...?!

125
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,002
Naruto...!

126
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,832
Sasame did it...

127
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,959
Since it's come to this, they're ours.

128
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,464
Your wound still hasn't healed.

129
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,050
Kagero, you wait here.

130
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,305
No mistake...They're Leaf Ninja.

131
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,474
If we take care of the Leaf pursuers...

132
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,646
Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge
the power of the Fuma Clan.

133
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,982
Yeah...

134
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,235
Let's come back with good news.

135
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,946
And with the heads of
the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!

136
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,997
I finally found it!

137
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,468
At first, I thought it was someone
from the Hidden Leaf Village.

138
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,845
But it's Sasame, believe it or not...

139
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,058
Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero...

140
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,936
This is an odd reunion.

141
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,733
Where's Arashi?!
He wasn't with all you guys?!

142
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:40,492
Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru
and is spending his days training.

143
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,954
Can I see Arashi?!

144
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,917
If you're also going to work together
with us for Lord Orochimaru,

145
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,669
I'm sure you'll be able to see him.

146
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,640
How'd it go?

147
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,188
You've done well.

148
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,316
With this, I'll be able to see Arashi, right?

149
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,821
After we've finished them off!

150
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,576
Why?! Weren't we just supposed to
take them to Lord Orochimaru

151
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,578
for examination after capturing them?!

152
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,873
We only need the heads
for the examination.

153
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,334
No!

154
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,962
These people... For my sake...!
Move it!

155
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,259
– Wha...?!
– Huh?!

156
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,805
What?!

157
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,974
The Fuma numbing medicine
didn't work!

158
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,936
We knew about it all along
from the beginning!

159
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,813
Sakura!

160
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,613
Substitution...?!

161
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,657
I leave Sasame to you!
Leave her to me!

162
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,913
Sasame... Hang in there!

163
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:16,129
Why...? Why does Sasame have
to do something like this?!

164
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,965
No, it's not that she's doing it
against her will...!

165
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,092
It's something she wanted to do!

166
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,844
Liar!

167
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,013
It's true...

168
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,224
What...

169
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,935
What should I do to be able
to see Arashi again?

170
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,187
It's not a difficult thing.

171
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,482
You just have to put the lights out of those
who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.

172
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,817
We have to kill them...?!

173
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,404
We'll take them back to Lord Orochimaru
for examination.

174
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,656
So we're not going to kill, right?

175
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:47,118
If we carry out that work,
Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.

176
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,833
Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone
are being tricked by Orochimaru.

177
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,086
He says that you'll just be used
and thrown away...

178
00:13:56,378 --> 00:14:00,048
Hanzaki's just a traitor
who abandoned the village.

179
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,133
Will you believe what we say?

180
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,053
Or will you believe what a traitor says?

181
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:10,100
Lord Orochimaru will surely restore
our Fuma Clan...

182
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:17,857
Sasame, although you're still young,
you're also one of the Fuma.

183
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,153
Assist in the restoration
of our Fuma Clan...

184
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,912
So you guys did trick Sasame!

185
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,832
It's all for the restoration
of the Fuma Clan!

186
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,546
You little!

187
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,845
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

188
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,222
Here I go!
Wha...!

189
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,183
U-zu-ma-ki...!

190
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,315
Naruto Barrage!

191
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,445
This is bad...!

192
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,539
Rasengan!

193
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,885
This is for Sasame.
Prepare yourselves!

194
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,554
Naruto!

195
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,479
You're...from before?!

196
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,440
The Earth Style Jutsu user
in question, huh?

197
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:45,862
However, there's no point to using that
Art in this rocky area.

198
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,951
Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from
inside the ground

199
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,120
and the spreading of its wings under
the sunlight is

200
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,665
but a momentary gleam.

201
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,335
That's when I die as Kagero!

202
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,298
Be careful!

203
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,100
What's this...?

204
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,144
Look! Naruto...

205
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,610
Wha...?!

206
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,915
U-Unbelievable!

207
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,792
You were a woman...?!

208
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,214
The clan will once again be
in a place lit by the sunlight...

209
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,467
Lord Orochimaru promised that...

210
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:54,764
I'll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art
if it's for the sake of that.

211
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,938
Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!

212
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,235
Naruto! Come with me!

213
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,910
Naruto!

214
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,681
I-I feel like...I've seen this before...

215
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,809
It's Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.

216
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,604
I summoned the extraordinarily
sturdy stomach of

217
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,398
the Mount Myoboku's
Iwajuku Giant Toad.

218
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,691
Stomach...?

219
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,322
Yikes!
It's melting...

220
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,865
If I didn't do this,

221
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,493
we wouldn't have been able to
defend ourselves from her Chakra.

222
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:18,348
I believed...that the clan
would someday...

223
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,850
I believed in that.

224
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,154
Sh-She vanished.

225
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,156
I've got to hand it to her.

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,575
She probably put all of her life
on the line

227
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,702
and attempted to save her comrades...

228
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,164
It's unforgivable!

229
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,212
Those guys...
the Fuma Ninja...

230
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,091
Their feelings toward the clan
is the same as our feelings!

231
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,805
Manipulating the Fuma's desire
to restore their clan...

232
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:05,270
I'll kick Orochimaru's butt, no matter what!

233
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,998
Wh-Where are we?

234
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,500
Kagero...!

235
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,963
You risked your life to save us?

236
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,720
You idiot...

237
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,738
Please...

238
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,909
Please use your Medical Ninjutsu
to save her.

239
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,954
Our comrade doesn't have
long to live!

240
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,126
Put your hands to your chests and think.

241
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,673
Think about what you weren't
able to accomplish...okay?

242
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:21,638
We risked our lives working for you...
to help you, Lord Orochimaru.

243
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,015
In order to restore the Fuma Clan!

244
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,643
Please recognize our work!

245
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,358
You'll just have to atone for
your failure with your bodies.

246
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,449
Lord Orochimaru!

247
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,743
I'm sorry for the betrayal!

248
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,441
When I recalled the parts one by one,

249
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:21,823
I felt as though
I had understood everything

250
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,452
Faded words

251
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:32,709
which I kept so close to me

252
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:38,423
Speechless nights,

253
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,427
a hint of warmth,

254
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:49,142
and this distant yearning for you

255
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,228
I live,

256
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:58,234
simply repeating this cycle

257
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,073
Held in my two hands

258
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:10,038
A droplet of time

259
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,795
Softly clutching forgotten memories

260
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

261
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,102
I'll keep these thoughts...

262
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,025
That's Orochimaru's residence!

263
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,737
It really is just like him to construct
his residence underground.

264
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,114
Sasuke is somewhere inside
that residence, right?

265
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,325
Sakura, let's hurry!
Right!

266
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,869
Be careful!
First Avenue of hell is up ahead!

267
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,746
Will a devil appear,
or will a snake appear?

268
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,706
Heh! I'm looking forward to it!

269
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,500
I'll kick the butts of the devil
and the snake.

270
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,462
And I'll save Sasuke and Arashi!

271
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,632
Next episode, "Pure Terror!
The House of Orochimaru"
