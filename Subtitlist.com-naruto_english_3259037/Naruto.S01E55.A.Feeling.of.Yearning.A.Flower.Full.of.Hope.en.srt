1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,797
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,268
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,395
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,776
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,912
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,750
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,336
I wake up

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,301
and someday,

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,028
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,915
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,795
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,880
One more time

23
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,154
Hey! Geez.

24
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,992
Hey, Pervy Sage!

25
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,120
Weren't you going to
watch my training?!

26
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,456
I'm researching now.

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,166
Do it yourself!

28
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,797
All right, then I'll summon a frog,
a frog so big you'll be shocked!

29
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,927
The Summoning Jutsu!

30
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,767
Hmm? What's wrong?
Did a frog appear?

31
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,981
W-Wait a minute!

32
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,942
What part of that's a frog?!

33
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,444
If you don't get serious,
I won't help you!

34
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,948
Shut up! I am being serious!

35
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,535
Then somehow find your Chakra
as if your life depended on it!

36
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,121
That's what I'm doing!

37
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,570
Huh?!

38
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,500
Sasuke...

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,296
-Hey Sakura!
-Huh?!

40
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,299
Sakura! It's about time you wake
and help me over here!

41
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,093
I'm not sleeping!
I'm busy right now!

42
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,263
Yes, yes...
Then when won't you be busy?

43
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,140
Later!

44
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,773
I can't believe it... Geez!

45
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,365
A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope

46
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,496
Some of you have probably
already heard but...

47
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,667
Gekko Hayate's corpse was
found near Kikyo Castle...

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,961
What... Hayate?

49
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,420
No way...

50
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,713
That's ridiculous!

51
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,841
Is the opponent Orochimaru?

52
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,261
No...we shouldn't jump to
that conclusion so easily.

53
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,724
The one Hayate was following
was likely a Sound spy called Kabuto...

54
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,853
Well, it's certain that Orochimaru
is trying to do something but...

55
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:34,733
So...we'll cancel Chunin Exam
and go after Orochimaru...?!

56
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,487
No, he revealed his identity to Anko...

57
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,323
sending us a threat not to cancel.

58
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,325
Not to cancel the Chunin Exam

59
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,412
for which all of the Ninja of
the Alliance have gathered!

60
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,372
What does it mean?

61
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,877
Orochimaru possesses enough power
to take down a small Land on his own.

62
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:59,591
He's a Ninja that probably
every land has eyes on.

63
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,469
Moreover, he conveniently holds
a grudge

64
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,596
against this Village Hidden
in the Leaves.

65
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,890
Any Land would desire him.

66
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:07,975
So could it be...

67
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,811
that any Land in the Alliance
would unite with Orochimaru

68
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,563
and betray the Village Hidden
in the Leaves?!

69
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,279
Well, the Alliance Treaty is at
the same level as a verbal agreement!

70
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,409
As was in the former Great Ninja War...

71
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,953
In any case,

72
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,248
there's too little information
right now.

73
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,876
Let's end these unnecessary
suspicions.

74
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,669
We've already dispatched Anbu,

75
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,255
the black ops to each Land
to collect information.

76
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,008
It's dangerous to act carelessly...

77
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,094
That could be what the enemy
is aiming for.

78
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,388
And also...

79
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,148
I trust all of you!

80
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,239
When the time comes,

81
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,368
we'll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf
Village together and simply fight!

82
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,020
At that time...

83
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,691
Be quiet about this bruise!

84
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,202
Should I have stopped him forcefully...?

85
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,707
No visitors...?

86
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,876
That's correct.
I'm sorry but...

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,547
I know he's been hospitalized,
but no visitors...?!

88
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,965
What's going on?

89
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,677
We're also not aware of the details so...

90
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,726
There's no use worrying about it here.

91
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,113
Huh?

92
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,448
Should I bring get-well flowers?

93
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,537
So pretty.

94
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,334
Oh no!

95
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:45,966
Oh... How unusual for you to come
by to buy our flowers.

96
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,052
N-Not really!
Why would you care?

97
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,847
Besides, isn't it unusual that
you're minding the shop?

98
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,851
I'll choose quickly.

99
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,020
People don't like flowers with
roots when they're in the hospital

100
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,272
since they don't want to
be "rooted" in the hospital...

101
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,983
So cut flowers are fundamental.

102
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,986
W-What are you talking about...?

103
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,113
Playing dumb won't work.

104
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,490
You're going to see Sasuke, right?

105
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,246
Mom! I'm going out for a bit!

106
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,207
I-Ino?!

107
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,252
I won't let you be the first to visit!
I'm going with you!

108
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,963
A get-well visit!

109
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,217
Shucks... Ino pig!

110
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,055
I'm taking this flower...

111
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,932
One "rose" of love!

112
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,018
That's so cliché...

113
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,230
Then I'll make mine this.
"Narcissus"!

114
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,858
A noble flower that doesn't
succumb to the cold of the winter,

115
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,861
but hopes for the spring and
waits with dignified presence...

116
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,532
with the wish for release from
the hospital as soon as possible.

117
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,035
You've gotten pretty knowledgeable.

118
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,120
I told you I wouldn't lose to you!

119
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,415
Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?

120
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,459
Uh... I need two.

121
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,962
Why? One is fine.

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,422
No... One for Lee too.

123
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,812
More please!

124
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,980
-Huh?!
-Huh?

125
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,607
Ten orders of kalbi!

126
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,700
You sure can eat.
Just watching you makes me feel ill.

127
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,702
Here you are!

128
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,370
It's here!

129
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,626
This is mine, all right?
Don't eat any of it, Shikamaru!

130
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,753
I won't eat any!

131
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,050
What's going on with you guys,
barbecue in the middle of the day?

132
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,135
-Oh...?
-Huh?

133
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,678
Ino and Sakura...

134
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,889
Shikamaru, shouldn't you be going through
some special training or something

135
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,057
to prepare for the final exam?

136
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,892
I am...

137
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,811
Every single day...

138
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,022
Asuma is so persistent.

139
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,986
Actually, Choji's been joining us
in the special training.

140
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,904
Really?

141
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,698
So you took it on?

142
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,828
Yup! In exchange, he's treating me
to as much barbecue as I can eat!

143
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,621
I see...

144
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,668
I shouldn't have held on
for the Final Round.

145
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,503
Don't be ridiculous!

146
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,131
There are numerous people who
want to participate, but can't!

147
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,424
That's right!

148
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,592
From what I've heard,

149
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,969
they're doing some awfully
difficult things

150
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,679
over at Guy and Kurenai's team!

151
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,973
W-What's that?

152
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,100
Even though we've made
it this far,

153
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,561
to get totally thrashed
wouldn't be very cool...

154
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,858
Aw man, what a drag...

155
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,120
Whatever the circumstances,

156
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,414
we've exceeded
a human being's limits.

157
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,833
So I've used too much Chakra...

158
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,003
Neji, are you all right?!

159
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,418
Summoning Jutsu!

160
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,964
What?! A tadpole again?!

161
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,466
You haven't made
any progress whatsoever!

162
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,803
See how it's bigger
than the ones earlier?!

163
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,139
How the heck should I know?!

164
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,024
So you want to see
Sasuke Uchiha...?

165
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,193
Just five minutes.

166
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,821
I can't allow you to visit
any longer than that.

167
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,117
His body still needs to rest...

168
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,201
Yes...

169
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,955
Sasuke. You have visitors...

170
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,624
Two cute young ladies...
Oh...!

171
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,834
-Huh?
-Huh?

172
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,963
Sasuke, Sasuke?

173
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,134
-His clothes are gone!
-What?!

174
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,721
It's terrible! He's in no condition
to be walking outside yet!

175
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,723
Doctor! Doctor!

176
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,392
Sasuke...

177
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,436
No way...

178
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,399
Sasuke will, without
a doubt, desire me...

179
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,157
Sasuke... Where in the world
have you gone...?

180
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,303
Could cliff-climbing be so taxing...?

181
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,807
Damn, my body is sluggish...

182
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,935
Will I make it in time...?

183
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,250
Open!

184
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,433
Huh?

185
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:13,979
Yo!

186
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,440
Huh... You finally made it here...

187
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,158
We'll search for Sasuke
on our end.

188
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,996
But if you happen to see him,
please contact us.

189
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,122
-We will.
-Yes.

190
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,624
And also...you wanted to see Lee, right?

191
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,709
-Yes.
-Yes.

192
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:41,756
He's also in no condition to move,
so please make your visit brief.

193
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,552
Lee, you have visitors.

194
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,513
Two cute young ladies...
Oh?!

195
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,806
-Huh?!
-Huh?!

196
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,809
Really... even Lee!

197
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,145
Lee! Lee!

198
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,230
-Lee...
-Huh?

199
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,649
-Look!
-Huh?

200
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,446
Lee...?!

201
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,490
Sakura, let's go!

202
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,617
Okay!

203
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,040
200 one-armed pushups...

204
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,501
If I can't do them,
100 one-legged squats...

205
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,172
190...!

206
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:32,390
Lee! Stop it!
Lee! Stop it!

207
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,434
191...

208
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,355
-Lee!
-Please don't touch me!

209
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:44,486
Don't...interfere...
with my training...

210
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,407
I need two...

211
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,161
Why? One is fine.

212
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,372
No... One for Lee too...

213
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:04,381
Speaking of which, Sakura,
did you hear about that Lee?

214
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,466
What? Hear what?

215
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,220
Well, that Lee...

216
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,349
his injuries were serious and
he can no longer...

217
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,893
continue as a Shinobi.

218
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,525
195...

219
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,408
196...

220
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,371
197...

221
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,835
198...

222
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm...not finished...yet!

223
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,513
There's no value in making
an effort for someone

224
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,432
who doesn't believe in himself!

225
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:14,284
One...one hundred...ninety...nine...

226
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,958
One... One more...

227
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,045
One more time...!

228
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,592
-Huh?!
-Oh!

229
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,343
Lee...!

230
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,645
I'll...go get the stretcher.

231
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,063
Please keep an eye on him.

232
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,190
Yes.

233
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,583
Hey...Ino...

234
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,667
Huh?

235
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:10,256
Why do boys...
have to push themselves?

236
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:21,434
Don't ask me that.
I'm a girl you know!

237
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,478
Sorry...

238
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,651
The Human...Boulder!

239
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,861
Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Ju...!

240
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,614
Darn it, I don't have enough Chakra!

241
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,877
What's the matter, Shikamaru?!

242
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,504
Have you hit your limit already?

243
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,382
Man! What a drag...

244
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,093
All right, Choji!
One more time!

245
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,155
Who brought that...?

246
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,627
The rose I went to the trouble
of bringing was a waste.

247
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,297
My narcissus too...

248
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,261
Oh... How boring.

249
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,762
Hey, Naruto!

250
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:44,309
The swimsuit gals have gone,
so why don't we call it a day?

251
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,728
What? Let's stay a little longer!

252
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,897
Come on, a little longer...
Just a little longer!

253
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,401
I'm hungry. And I'm pretty tired too.

254
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,320
You haven't even done anything.

255
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,324
You should be thankful
I hung out with you!

256
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,159
He's getting ticked off at me.

257
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,622
All right, I got it... Sexy Jutsu!

258
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,296
Oh!

259
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,677
What, that's it?

260
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:24,515
What I want to do isn't the Sexy Jutsu,
but Summoning Jutsu!

261
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,227
All right, all right...
Then try it out.

262
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,438
Here goes...!

263
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,274
Summoning...Jutsu!

264
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,319
I did it!

265
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,949
You should die!
You have no talent!

266
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,493
-Take a careful look!
-Huh?

267
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,919
See, it has rear legs!

268
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:57,006
You idiot! Conjure one up with
hands, feet and ears!

269
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,885
Shut your mouth!
Having legs is better than before!

270
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,441
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

271
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,861
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

272
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,281
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

273
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,660
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

274
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:32,083
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

275
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:38,172
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

276
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,841
Fight! Fight! Fight!

277
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,062
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

278
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,524
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

279
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,986
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

280
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,573
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

281
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:09,746
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

282
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:15,918
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

283
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,003
Fight! Fight! Fight!

284
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:23,509
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

285
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:29,557
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

286
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,059
Fight! Fight! Fight!

287
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,109
Ichiraku's ramen is
as good as usual!

288
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,779
If the training continues like this,
I don't mind doing it forever!

289
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,323
Eat, keeping eating more because
this will be the last...

290
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,783
What? Did you say something?

291
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,535
-Do you like the food?
-Hey master, one more bowl of ramen please!

292
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,956
Good. Just keep eating away so
you'll have no regrets about your life.

293
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,753
Next time, "Live or Die:
Risk it All to Win it All!"

294
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,006
Is this sage hiding something from me?
