1
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,583
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,421
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,593
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,847
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,561
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,034
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,164
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,985
How is she?

16
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:55,115
I don't know why
she suddenly collapsed...

17
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,034
I see.

18
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,079
The collection ships depart
in the morning.

19
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,832
We should get back to the inn.

20
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,251
But then,
what will happen to Isaribi?

21
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,462
Who cares?
She's the Demon of the Ocean!

22
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,172
But...

23
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,217
Naruto, what in the world happened
with you and that girl?

24
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:18,472
Aw c'mon! I told you
a little while ago, she saved me!

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,841
What happened?

26
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,678
Sorry, my hand slipped.

27
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,555
I see.

28
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,854
I'll clean this up right away.

29
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,147
Anko.

30
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,565
Yes?

31
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:14,111
The studies here,
the Hokage knows about them.

32
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:15,946
I understand.

33
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,544
So, you're saying that this girl
named Isaribi saved you?

34
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,006
Yeah, I owe my life to her.

35
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,886
Even if that's so, there's no doubt
that this girl named Isaribi

36
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,598
was one of the people
who attacked us.

37
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,602
Our mission is to protect
the government's money

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,187
and catch the Demon of the Ocean.

39
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,273
That's right, and no matter
how you look at it,

40
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,776
there's no doubt that
she's the Demon of the Ocean!

41
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,737
Yeah, but I think there's some reason
for all that.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm going to follow her and...!

43
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,698
You're talking nonsense.

44
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,242
Besides, even if we were to follow her,
we've got no idea where she is.

45
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,036
No, I have one.

46
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,871
Really, Shino?

47
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,207
It's something I heard.

48
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,834
It seems there's one island
in this country

49
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,878
that played a central role in a series
of spiriting away incidents.

50
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,630
Where is it?!

51
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,424
A deserted island where
the Demon of the Ocean lives,

52
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,592
Demon Island.

53
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,677
Demon Island?

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,596
Sensei, are you doing okay?

55
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,932
Yes, more importantly,

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,810
there's something I want to tell you
about the Demon of the Ocean.

57
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,854
The true identity of this thing called
the Demon of the Ocean

58
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,941
is a human whose flesh
has been altered.

59
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,317
What?!

60
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,694
What did you say?

61
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,464
Don't muck things up like that again.

62
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,049
Yes sir.

63
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,376
She's out, the monster!
What the...?

64
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,837
– Get out of here.
– You're bad luck.

65
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,213
Take this!

66
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,217
She's the one who was spirited away.

67
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,845
And why would she be
the only one who came back?

68
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,487
What are you talking about?

69
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,783
A spiriting away that occurred
ten years ago in the Land of Sea,

70
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,160
but that was not the working
of a demon.

71
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,622
Orochimaru kidnapped humans
to use as live subjects

72
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,916
for his research at the time.

73
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,210
Orochimaru...

74
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,131
Is Orochimaru mixed up
in this current matter?

75
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,843
Wait a minute.
Orochimaru and tests!

76
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,512
Why are you suddenly
saying such things?

77
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:31,767
I have to explain it to you from
when Orochimaru left the village.

78
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,311
Over ten years ago,

79
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,900
Orochimaru's desire to satisfy his own
inquiring mind and further his power

80
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,153
was such that he gradually
exceeded the scope of a Shinobi

81
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,616
and in the end, got involved in developing
what are called Forbidden Jutsu.

82
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,162
How unfortunate.

83
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,377
Naturally, this soon became
known to the village.

84
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,840
After Orochimaru!

85
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,299
Stop that guy!

86
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:12,224
But Orochimaru, who traveled
in and out of country on missions...

87
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:16,145
had several other private facilities
outside of the Leaf Village...

88
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,566
So one of those is on Demon Island?

89
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,110
So, the people who disappeared?

90
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,530
They were used for
human experiments.

91
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,698
What?

92
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,451
Damn Orochimaru!
What does he think people are?

93
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,036
So, what are we going to do?

94
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,706
It's obvious, isn't it?
We get into their hideout!

95
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,876
And we have to get
Isaribi back!

96
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,170
It's settled.

97
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,173
We'll continue and hit
the Demon of the Ocean's hideout.

98
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:55,475
Sensei, how long have you known
about Demon Island?

99
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,938
It's because Orochimaru
was the Jonin in charge of me.

100
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,064
Huh?

101
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,652
Tell me when we get close
to the island.

102
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,575
The pain is gradually getting stronger.

103
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,412
Somebody's coming.

104
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,915
What shall we do?

105
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,584
Do as you please.

106
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,835
Yes.

107
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,926
The arrogance...
One day I'll pay him back!

108
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:39,937
This way.

109
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,939
Hurry!

110
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,157
How is it, Shino?

111
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,825
No problem.

112
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,118
Okay!

113
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,921
So, a collection ship
is on the move, huh?

114
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,006
Just the right time.

115
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,511
Good work, I was right to send you
back to Mother Island.

116
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,348
What's wrong? You're pale.

117
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,186
When will I return to normal?

118
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,023
Like you said, I've gathered
information about the ships

119
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,653
from the market
and the village, even the attacks. So...

120
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,364
What are you bringing up, Isaribi?

121
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,744
You can't possibly have forgotten
your role as a prototype.

122
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,708
As a converted body,
your cooperation in generating data...

123
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,420
That was one
of the conditions of the promise.

124
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,966
Don't worry, we'll soon be done
getting data from you.

125
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:56,013
I'll keep the promise...
as long as I don't change my mind.

126
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,639
You understand, right?

127
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:58,724
Yes.

128
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,687
Well, if you understand,
go keep our guests company.

129
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,938
I understand...

130
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,694
You're vicious, too.

131
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,118
There's no sign of 'em.

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,923
What is this?

133
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,968
Birds, no fish?

134
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,897
Don't move!

135
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,107
Too bad, isn't it?

136
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,318
Don't mess with Shinobi
from the Leaf Village.

137
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,505
Well, well,
aren't these cute kitties?

138
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,103
Is everyone okay?

139
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,187
Yep.

140
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,822
As always, you people
are addicted to peace.

141
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,074
You're from last evening!

142
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,077
Your face looks familiar.

143
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,958
The Chunin Exams,
if I remember correctly.

144
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,548
That's right...

145
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,759
As I recall, Sasuke's adversary!

146
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,470
The guy who was with
that Kabuto?!

147
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,013
You are correct...

148
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,392
Of course,
I haven't seen him since then.

149
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,563
You used a strange Jutsu
to suck up other's Chakras.

150
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,899
You're the guy who sucked up
all of Sasuke's strength.

151
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,779
Well, all of you, come at me.
I'm different than I was then.

152
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,241
Okay, I'll finish you off right now!

153
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,285
Wait, Naruto!

154
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,786
Shino?

155
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,832
You go ahead.
Seems like I'm the opponent for him.

156
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,000
Huh?

157
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,504
His Jutsu is not suited for
your style of close combat.

158
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,091
We can't have all three of us stay here.

159
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,176
All right.

160
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,845
– We're counting on you, Shino!
– Be careful!

161
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,055
Wait!

162
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,186
Parasitic Insects, eh?

163
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,466
Found 'im!

164
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,600
Who?

165
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,067
Welcome, or should I say,
haven't seen you in a while?

166
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,947
It's you, Amachi.

167
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,990
I'm surprised!

168
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,828
I can't believe you've come back
after something like that happened...

169
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:49,913
Like what?

170
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,123
You don't remember?

171
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,001
Sorry, but I have no business
with you...

172
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,586
Where is Orochimaru?

173
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,214
Orochimaru?

174
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,092
Don't play dumb.
He's here, isn't he?

175
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,889
A Curse Mark responds even
though the operator isn't around...

176
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,016
Stuff like that happens huh?

177
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,686
True, Orochimaru was here...

178
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,022
But that was over half a month ago.

179
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,691
No way.

180
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,652
It doesn't matter if you don't
believe me.

181
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,947
So the pain I felt so far...

182
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,658
has been the influence of Orochimaru's
presence here half a month ago?

183
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,995
Wait a minute.

184
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,454
Sensei!

185
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,539
You two!

186
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,041
Oh my, you brought Genin.

187
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,003
Anko, you're all grown up...

188
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,963
Who is that?

189
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,425
Amachi... a Medical Ninja
who partnered with Orochimaru,

190
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,385
and was running
various experiments here.

191
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:51,391
Orochimaru's not here.
This whole incident was all his doing.

192
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,852
Him?!

193
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,564
Hey you! How dare you run
those ridiculous tests!

194
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:03,320
Ridiculous? This is no joke,
I've devoted my life to this research.

195
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,404
What was that?!

196
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,284
Look! This one has the physical ability
to adapt to water.

197
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,661
She combines the ability
to breathe underwater

198
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,914
and the muscle strength
to move freely and quickly.

199
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,459
It's been a dream of mine
for many years,

200
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,461
to form a Ninja corps
for underwater combat.

201
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,879
This is the first step.

202
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,340
A Ninja corps for underwater combat?

203
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,093
That's right, a military corps able
to move freely underwater

204
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,721
that the common person
definitely could not imitate.

205
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,307
When that happens,
we can divide land and land

206
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,018
and completely control
marine shipping routes!

207
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,062
Wonderful, is it not?

208
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,106
With this strength,
I'll stand on top of the world.

209
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,487
And I'll make Orochimaru regret
abandoning this research.

210
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,823
People are not your tools!

211
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,368
Oh my, you're so young,

212
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,663
you don't understand the greatness
of this research...

213
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,541
Well, you're average guinea pigs
who don't know any better,

214
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,877
so I don't think I want you to understand.

215
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,379
Bastard!

216
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,970
That's good, Isaribi.

217
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,681
Out of the way, Isaribi!

218
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,516
No!

219
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,359
What's wrong? You can't fight
by just running around in circles.

220
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,203
Damn it!

221
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,584
Why are you protecting that guy?

222
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,336
That guy did this to you, Isaribi!

223
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,421
Yeah, but...!

224
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,424
But it can't be helped.

225
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,428
This is the only person who can
return my body back to normal.

226
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,680
He promised.

227
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,682
Look.

228
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,186
Isaribi...

229
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,859
People are judged based solely
on their appearance.

230
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,029
People don't dare come near me
just from being covered in bandages.....

231
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,616
A monster with these scales
would be out of the question.

232
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,954
I want to return to my former body,
I want to be a human!

233
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,373
For that reason,
I decided I'd do anything!

234
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,043
You're a human being even now, Isaribi!

235
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,295
Huh?!

236
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,965
And yet you join with those guys
to attack and sink ships.

237
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:33,344
Isn't that far more like something
a monster would do?!

238
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,305
Stop it, shut up!

239
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,640
I-I...

240
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,934
I don't want to hear it!
Shut up, shut up!

241
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,772
Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?

242
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,737
No... I-I'm the same as you!

243
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,822
You're lying!

244
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,075
What are you talking about?
You're a normal human.

245
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,746
I want to be like you too!

246
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,713
Don't cry Isaribi...
I'll properly return you to normal.

247
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,509
Watch out!

248
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,936
A bulls-eye letter bomb.

249
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,397
Thanks to Isaribi doing a good job
of attracting your attention.

250
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,528
S-Sensei...

251
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,154
I'll leave the rest to you.

252
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,489
Okay.

253
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,949
Let's go, Isaribi.

254
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,326
Wait!

255
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,913
Don't go, Isaribi!

256
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,876
Damn it!

257
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,340
We'd better take care of
this right away.

258
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,260
Give it up... It's over.

259
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,012
We'll make you a guinea pig
for Amachi, too.

260
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,433
Insect clone?!

261
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,645
We're the same
Chakra-eating colleagues, after all.

262
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,856
It won't be easy to finish a fight.

263
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:15,989
He disappeared?

264
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,492
What is he thinking?

265
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,497
There you go!

266
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,249
Naruto!

267
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,670
I'm going to strangle you
to death like this.

268
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,473
What...?!

269
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,316
Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.

270
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,992
All right, you did it, Ino!

271
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,954
Damn it!
Let me go, let me go!

272
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,873
That's dirty of you!

273
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,541
What are you talking about?

274
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,877
There are no such things as
being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,296
And you call yourself a Ninja?

276
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,464
Shut up!

277
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,717
What?

278
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,015
This place is collapsing.

279
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,476
They're planning to take care
of us along with the building.

280
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,645
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

281
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,940
Hurry, the entrance is
already useless.

282
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,489
I thought this place would
be traced soon.

283
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,907
It's an old building,

284
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,076
but a damn good tomb
for the likes of them.

285
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,206
One person didn't make it in time?

286
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,502
Oh well, doesn't have much of an influence
on attacking a collection ship.

287
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,800
Damn! Where's the exit?!

288
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,697
The wind blows, Ah...

289
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,617
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

290
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,578
What should be brought along?

291
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,456
Assemble them into a piece.

292
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,127
There is no second chance, never

293
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,796
How foolish it is to throw away

294
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,466
Acting so innocently, Ah...

295
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,676
The images.

296
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,058
It probably will not end

297
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:55,565
It probably will not end

298
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,028
Burn that love-filled heart,

299
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,239
Sail across a thousand dreams

300
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,075
Running freely

301
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

302
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,999
The clouds scatter

303
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,085
The sun sets yet again

304
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:22,800
The solo parade begins to move.

305
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

306
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,724
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

307
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,941
Well, where's the exit, Shino?!

308
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,109
How should I know?

309
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,277
Then, what do we do, Ino?!

310
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,529
We just have to stop complaining
and run!

311
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,947
But I don't see an exit at all!

312
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,949
It seems the exit has collapsed.

313
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,284
– What?!
– What?!

314
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,286
Are we going to be buried alive?!

315
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,412
– No!
– Since it's come to this...

316
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,581
– I'll use my Rasengan!
– What're you doing?

317
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,000
– How can you be calm?!
– Oh, shut up!

318
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,544
You guys step back a little!

319
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time: "Despair: A Fractured Heart."
