1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,594
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,520
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,861
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,698
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,036
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,665
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,171
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,051
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,849
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,851
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:09,945
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,036
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,834
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,755
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,344
Die.

21
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,889
Darn!

22
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,682
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

23
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:48,609
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
And there are quite a few of them.

24
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,758
Here I go!

25
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,405
It's impossible, after all...

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,699
There is no way that you can beat a guy!

27
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,081
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy.

28
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,125
Sasuke!

29
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,088
I see!

30
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,215
So that's your plan, Naruto!

31
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,009
That's pretty good for you!

32
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,902
Demon Wind Shuriken,
Windmill of Shadows...

33
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:25,331
A Shuriken won't work on me.

34
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,639
I see.

35
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,059
This time it's aiming for my real body...

36
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,062
But... It's not so easy!

37
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,401
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!

38
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,819
This is...

39
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,696
The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

40
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,617
A second Shuriken in his blind spot!

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,751
But...

42
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,463
Still too naïve.

43
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,007
He dodged it!

44
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,355
Here it is!

45
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,148
Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!

46
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,723
You little brat!

47
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,032
Kakashi Sensei!

48
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,497
Naruto...

49
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,916
Your strategy was outstanding.

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,211
You've grown up... Both of you.

51
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,217
The purpose of the Shadow Clones
was not to take down Zabuza,

52
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:47,181
but to hide my transformation
into Demon Wind Shuriken!

53
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,701
I left one clone behind, then
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.

54
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,841
Then a clone threw the real me, who had
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,

55
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,176
towards Sasuke!

56
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,345
Sasuke!

57
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,682
When Sasuke got me,

58
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,018
he must have realized
right away who I was.

59
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,187
Then he took out his own Shuriken...

60
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,731
And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

61
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,491
Demon Wind Shuriken...

62
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,700
Windmill of Shadows!

63
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,125
Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken,
I aimed for Zabuza.

64
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,504
Of course I didn't think
I would defeat Zabuza!

65
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,549
But I thought I'd destroy
the Water Prison.

66
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,301
And as a bonus
I defeated his water clone, too...

67
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,095
It was a huge success!

68
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,848
That was a fluke...

69
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,267
It was a fluke, huh!

70
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,772
Still, they performed oustandingly
in tandem in this desperate situation.

71
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,191
Despite the fact...

72
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,318
that those two always
fight like cats and dogs.

73
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,198
I got distracted and
broke my Water Prison Jutsu...

74
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,200
That's not it!

75
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,202
You didn't break the Jutsu...

76
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,663
They forced you to break it.

77
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,134
I'll tell you now,
the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.

78
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,511
So what will you do?

79
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,025
Sakura! Stay alert.

80
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,229
Sharingan!

81
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,316
Ushi, saru, u. Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.

82
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,527
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
Inu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.

83
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,154
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne...

84
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,158
Ushi, saru, u. Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.

85
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,078
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
Inu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.

86
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,955
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne.

87
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,042
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.

88
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,711
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

89
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,839
-Ne, ushi, saru, tori. Jin, ne, inoshishi.
-Jin, saru, tori, tatsu. Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.

90
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,342
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

91
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,469
Ne, ushi, saru, tori. Jin, ne, inoshishi.

92
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,429
Tori!

93
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,435
Water Style! Water Dragon Jutsu!

94
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,177
He copied that chant in seconds...

95
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,763
and so perfectly...!

96
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,768
W-What is this? Is it Ninjutsu!

97
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,495
Strange...

98
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,622
What is going on...?

99
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,667
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.

100
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,544
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

101
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,549
The Sharingan is the ability to memorize
and copy the enemy's Jutsu...

102
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,842
But...

103
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,844
Tori!

104
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,808
Water Style! Water Dragon Jutsu!

105
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,270
The Jutsu was set in motion
at the same time!

106
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,273
By any chance, is this guy...

107
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,965
This guy...!

108
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,199
The same identical movement!

109
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,743
Furthermore, at exactly the same time!

110
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,080
What's going on, Sasuke!

111
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,423
This guy...

112
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,924
My movements...!

113
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,844
He's perfectly...

114
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,847
Reading them.

115
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,515
What?

116
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,560
He's reading my mind?!

117
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,732
Blast him! He's...

118
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,112
giving me that barren, evil eye... right?

119
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,036
You're just copying...
You're a pale imitation.

120
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,831
-You won't be able to beat me!
-You won't be able to beat me!

121
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,499
-You!
-You!

122
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,004
I'll shut that copycat
monkey-mouth permamently!

123
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,719
W-What's that!

124
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,018
Me?

125
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,770
R-Ridiculous!

126
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,899
Is that his Genjutsu (Illusion Jutsu)?

127
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,778
Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!

128
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,829
W-Wha...!

129
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,878
No way!

130
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,847
I was just about to
set forth that Jutsu...

131
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,147
I can't keep up with... his Jutsu!

132
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,865
It's over...

133
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,343
Why...?

134
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:50,307
Are you able to see into the future...?

135
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,267
Yeah...

136
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,145
You're going to die!

137
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,048
You were right. He died.

138
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,762
He's definitely dead.

139
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,435
I thank you.

140
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:23,483
I have been waiting for the chance
to kill Zabuza.

141
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,488
By the looks of that mask...

142
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,533
You're a Tracker Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Mist.

143
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,496
Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.

144
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,456
Tracker Ninja?

145
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,875
You don't know what a Tracker Ninja is?

146
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,336
We learned it at the Academy, didn't we?

147
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,338
Tracker Ninja pursue...

148
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,340
guys like Zabuza

149
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,677
who turn against the village
where they were born and raised.

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,304
And when they break away from the village,

151
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,807
Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninja
and assassinate them...

152
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,768
in order to avoid having
the secrets of the village being leaked.

153
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,020
That's common knowledge!

154
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,231
You should study more!

155
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,567
That's right.

156
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,278
I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village's
Tracking Unit

157
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,739
whose mission is to hunt Rogue Ninja.

158
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:16,661
From his height and voice,
he's not all that different from Naruto...

159
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,080
A Tracker Ninja...?

160
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:30,133
He's not just an ordinary kid...

161
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,371
What are you?!

162
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,964
Hey you!

163
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,469
Don't worry, Naruto. He's not an enemy.

164
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,888
That's not what I'm asking!

165
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,431
I...!

166
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,183
I mean...!

167
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,144
That Zabuza... That Zabuza was killed!

168
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,438
That guy who was so strong...

169
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,235
He was killed so easily...by a kid
who's no different from me!

170
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,736
We're...

171
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,072
We're pathetic!

172
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,743
I can't accept that!

173
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,748
Well! I understand your disbelief.

174
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,752
But... this, too, is reality.

175
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,177
In this world, there are kids
who are younger than you...

176
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,972
and stronger than me.

177
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,581
Your battle is over for now.

178
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,043
I must get rid of this corpse...

179
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,046
because it contains many secrets.

180
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,801
Now then, please excuse me.

181
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,515
He's disappeared!

182
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,775
He's not here anymore.

183
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,366
What was all this for?!

184
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,746
What are we anyway?!

185
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,333
Naruto...

186
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:14,339
Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! DARN it!

187
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,760
Things like this happen
when you're a Ninja.

188
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,221
If you're frustrated, apply it next time!

189
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,314
Our mission hasn't ended yet.

190
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,109
We must take Mr.Tazuna home.

191
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,531
So sorry, everyone!

192
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,618
You can rest at my house!

193
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,996
Okay! Let's perk up and go!

194
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,761
W-What!

195
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,096
What happened!

196
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,224
Kakashi Sensei!

197
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,900
Kakashi Sensei!

198
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,084
What'll we do?!

199
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,753
Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!

200
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,381
Gato's henchmen are probably
gonna come and attack us again!

201
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,967
Guess it means we've gotta
fight by ourselves.

202
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,969
Who knows if this training will
make us stronger but,

203
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,639
it's getting interesting!

204
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,265
I'll definitely get stronger.

205
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,727
Next time: "The Forest of Chakra."

206
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm going to kick butt once again!
