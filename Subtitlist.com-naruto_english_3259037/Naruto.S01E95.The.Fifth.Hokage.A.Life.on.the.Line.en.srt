1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,728
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,068
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,319
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:33,325
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:37,538
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:43,836
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,214
Now open your eyes and

11
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:51,093
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:09,862
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,448
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,172
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:35,638
As for me...
I stand by my words.

22
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,393
That's...my Way of Ninja!

23
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,939
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing!

24
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:49,109
Just get out of the way!
Run away!

25
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,320
Just like our wager,

26
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,907
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.

27
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,958
I...

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,046
I will absolutely not die
until I've become Hokage!

29
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,513
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!

30
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,691
I-It can't be...

31
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,697
The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,950
Rasengan!

33
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,287
This is...?!

34
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,598
Way to go, Naruto.

35
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,684
That Nine-Tailed Fox kid...

36
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,062
a kid like that,
doing a technique like that...

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,189
I-It can't be...

38
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,524
He can't be, really...

39
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,534
In only one week,
that Rasengan...

40
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,711
You... Even after you received
that Jutsu...?!

41
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,966
I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,

42
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,177
and before I received the Jutsu
I had started healing.

43
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,056
The reason why Orochimaru favors me...

44
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,019
is not because of my use of Jutsu
or my sense for Jutsu...

45
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,604
It is because my recuperative power.

46
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:19,528
The power to energize cells
and make new cells.

47
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,533
On the other hand...
I've used up almost all of my Chakra.

48
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,581
That Jutsu...
seems it was Naruto's last effort...

49
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,598
Wh-What?!

50
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,815
I-It can't be...

51
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,112
Even with my powers of recuperation,
this much damage.

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,117
I don't...have...enough Chakra.

53
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,343
Arrhythmia!

54
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,768
Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters...

55
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,478
Why did that happen...?

56
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,439
That moment?!

57
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,859
At that moment of release...

58
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,862
did he shred the muscles
around his heart...?

59
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,038
Stop shaking!

60
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,422
Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.

61
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:07,636
Are we really getting a snack?
That guy looks like he's going to die.

62
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,222
You're annoying! Be quiet!

63
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,652
It's all over...for Naruto.

64
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,658
I...cut...his heart's Chakra Network

65
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,495
which restores the strength...

66
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,290
through the Nine-Tail's Chakra...

67
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,333
With all my strength.

68
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:45,340
In order to eliminate the possibility
that he would heal with his own power.

69
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,179
There's no way he can recover...

70
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,014
Even with you.

71
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,140
Shut up!

72
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,977
I'll kill you later...

73
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,985
He's stopped breathing...!

74
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,331
Dammit!

75
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,249
Dammit!

76
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,376
Dammit!

77
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,262
It's dark...

78
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,182
Dark...

79
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,518
Why is it getting dark?

80
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,233
My strength is... Why...?

81
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,320
What...?

82
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,577
Don't die...

83
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,537
Don't die!

84
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,498
Don't die!

85
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,458
Don't die!

86
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,002
Don't die!

87
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,887
The bet...

88
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,563
I won it.

89
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,485
I-It's impossible...

90
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:44,334
"Hokage is...my dream," eh?

91
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,681
For the last time...

92
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,268
For the last time...

93
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,478
Just one more time...

94
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,152
I want to bet on you...

95
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,294
That child, he's not well...

96
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,964
Tsunade is a medical specialist.

97
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,468
Don't worry, there's no need to
worry about Naruto's body.

98
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,346
That's not what I meant.

99
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,472
What?

100
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:44,436
Your battle is with me,
there's no time to look away.

101
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,398
Who would have imagined this?

102
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,694
If that child is found by the Akatsuki,
there will be trouble.

103
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,364
In other words,
if I'm to kill him...

104
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,074
now is the time!

105
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,375
Shoot!

106
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,220
He's aiming at this child!

107
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,435
Tsunade... You're the only one
I wasn't going to kill...

108
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,688
If that child lives,

109
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,693
there will be trouble in the future
on a variety of levels.

110
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,403
Don't get in my way.

111
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,489
This is one child...

112
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,536
This is one child...
I will absolutely protect!

113
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:32,419
Trembling at the sight of blood,
why would you, one of the Sannin,

114
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:37,674
risk your life to protect that Genin kid?

115
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,022
To protect...

116
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,318
my hometown...the Leaf Village...!

117
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,700
To protect the Leaf Village...?

118
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,505
Because...because...

119
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,591
this small child...

120
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,094
is the kid who will become
Hokage some day...

121
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,683
What utter nonsense...

122
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,313
By the way...
to hell with Hokage!

123
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,524
Only a fool does that job.

124
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,321
To hell with Hokage!
Only a fool does that job.

125
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,955
The wishes of the two...

126
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:55,126
More importantly, Lady Tsunade,
your wish...

127
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,837
Have you forgotten your dream?

128
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,136
The successive lines of Hokage
have protected

129
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,265
the Leaf Village and
and those living in it.

130
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,311
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

131
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,231
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!

132
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,905
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage...

133
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,283
It doesn't matter if
you are a woman!

134
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,618
I'll clobber you with all my might!

135
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:44,009
And now,
I also will put my life on the line!

136
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:51,474
If your life is worth throwing away
for a kid like him...!

137
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,645
Then dying now would be
a fitting end!

138
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,168
All that's left...is Naruto.

139
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,878
Lady Tsunade!

140
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,924
Make it in time!

141
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,565
She's still able to move even
after I pierced her down to her lungs!

142
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,951
You mean you'll still protect that kid?!

143
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,707
That's what I said...

144
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,875
From now...

145
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,421
I'm putting my life on the line!

146
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,300
You, half-dead corpse!

147
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:25,860
No matter how cool you try to be,
your trembling doesn't stop.

148
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,824
You can't get away from
the curse of hemophobia.

149
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:37,330
And yet, why would you
take the blows for that kid?

150
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:42,252
Why would you battle for the Leaf?

151
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,389
No way!

152
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,766
Tsunade's trembling has...

153
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,892
has stopped?

154
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,355
That is because...I am...

155
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,281
the Leaf Village's...Fifth Hokage!

156
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,783
That sign is?!

157
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,121
Lady Tsunade has conquered
her fear of blood,

158
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,748
but that's...

159
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,754
What are you saying you'll do,
after all this time?

160
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:32,927
You can't fight with that wound
even if you've conquered your fear.

161
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:44,606
W-Wait! I'll treat that wound.
So don't release that seal!

162
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,611
Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!

163
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,573
Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!

164
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,758
What is this Jutsu...?!

165
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:21,100
It looks like I'm not the only one
who develops new Jutsu.

166
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,354
What in the world is this Jutsu?

167
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,356
Well...

168
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,027
For many years I've stored Chakra
in my forehead.

169
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,658
The mass of Chakra stimulated
a variety of proteins.

170
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,078
The number of times my cells divide
speeds to a dizzying rate...

171
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,455
The cells rebuild...

172
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,377
and all the organs and body systems
are revitalized.

173
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,506
It's not the ability to restore,
it's the ability to reincarnate.

174
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,552
That means I won't die...from battles.

175
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,016
But the number of times a person's cells
divide in their lifetime is fixed...

176
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,063
If that is sped up,
it essentially shortens the life!

177
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,234
Lady Tsunade!

178
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,445
That action is...

179
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,447
Lord Orochimaru!

180
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,618
Come out!

181
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,246
Hurry!

182
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,916
Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!

183
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,253
– Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu!

184
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,144
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

185
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:14,983
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

186
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,195
On your still shoulder

187
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,575
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

188
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,498
The city lights are like pieces of stars

189
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:35,294
That hold us together

190
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:39,882
"Each one of us

191
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

192
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,432
you say laughingly

193
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:53,730
but you look most dazzling

194
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,109
Like a comet,

195
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:04,323
like the rainbow after the storm

196
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,911
You bring light

197
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,456
into my heart

198
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,168
Being lost

199
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:21,966
can be the answer

200
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,635
Let's promise

201
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:29,849
we won't cheat

202
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:35,021
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

203
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,736
The time to conclude this long, fateful
confrontation has come, Orochimaru.

204
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,864
You have sunk too deeply into vice.

205
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,325
You are no longer a comrade!

206
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,037
Comrade? How odious.

207
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,915
That word makes me shiver.

208
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,958
I will bring you down!

209
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,629
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!

210
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,632
Next time:
"Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!"
