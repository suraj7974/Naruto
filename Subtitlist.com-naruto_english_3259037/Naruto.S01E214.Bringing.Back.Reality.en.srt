1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,841
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,914
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,932
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,936
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,750
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,260
His music is a Ninjutsu?

15
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:38,432
Yeah! Awesome Chakra started bursting
throughout my body.

16
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,851
My power goes up like crazy!

17
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,188
That's a rare Jutsu, isn't it?

18
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,484
Shizune, have we identified the one
who attacked the villagers?

19
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,736
No, not yet...

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,532
Menma. I've once heard of
a Jutsu similar to yours.

21
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,159
– What?!
– Is that true, Grandma?!

22
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,036
I seem to recall that
the Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,413
that use musical instruments as
the catalysts.

24
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,500
Land of Rice Paddies?
You mean that Land of Rice Paddies?

25
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,668
Come to think of it,

26
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,046
the upper part of the mountain stream
where Naruto found Menma was...

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,130
Land of Rice Paddies?

28
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,843
Please allow me to go there!

29
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,595
But infiltrating another land
without cause is...

30
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,557
No, we do have cause!

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,811
There might be hints there
about Menma's lost memory.

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,855
I'd also like to make that request.

33
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,899
Very well.

34
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,361
Excellent, Grandma!
Now you're talking!

35
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,863
Thank you.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,333
Bringing Back Reality

37
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,045
And so we'll be heading out for a bit.

38
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,589
Right, got it.

39
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,591
The special pickled bamboo shoots
should be ready

40
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,718
by the time you guys get back.

41
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,512
I can't wait. Bye!

42
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,898
Really, there's no real need
for you guys to come.

43
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,567
We have no choice. It's a mission.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
Our mission is to accompany you guys!

45
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,991
Now that it's settled...

46
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,911
Let's get to the Land of Rice Paddies!

47
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,037
Right.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,622
– Naruto.
– Huh?

49
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,832
-You stay here.
-Huh?

50
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,545
What do you want, Grandma?

51
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,131
If you're any kind of sorry excuse
for a Shinobi, you should know.

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
What?

53
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,927
I'm talking about Menma.
If that kid is a...

54
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,638
No way is he a bad guy.

55
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,556
I know he's not a bad person.

56
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,601
But can you state flatly that
he's not an enemy spy?

57
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,146
What're you driving at, Grandma?!

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,190
You couldn't have forgotten.

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,776
The Village Hidden in Sound
in the Land of Rice Paddies

60
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,695
is the place where Orochimaru
once hid himself.

61
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,947
Well, I...

62
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,869
I...remember that, but...

63
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:07,331
Menma's Jutsu is strikingly similar to that
of the opponent Shikamaru fought

64
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,792
when Sasuke was taken away.

65
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,086
There's no denying there's a chance

66
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,588
he's affiliated with
the Hidden Sound Village.

67
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:19,510
And if he remembers something and
that was to become a threat to this land...

68
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,437
No way could Menma be an enemy...
That just can't be!

69
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,827
We'll leave you behind if you dawdle!

70
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,704
Naruto, I'm going on ahead!

71
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,515
Are you hurt?

72
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,726
No... Thanks for the help.

73
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,854
You were going a bit too fast.

74
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,147
Let's take a break.

75
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,948
What the heck's wrong?!

76
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,160
Who in the world is he?

77
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,997
We're going to investigate
because we don't know that.

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,791
I was running at full speed earlier.

79
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,794
Losing my footing on the branch
after that was on purpose, though...

80
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,296
What?

81
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,174
Not only did he keep up with my speed,

82
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,842
but he even showed
the composure to save me.

83
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,804
He is better than us in terms of speed.

84
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,144
He'd be a troublesome opponent
if we end up fighting.

85
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,772
Wha...?
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

86
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,607
He's not an enemy!

87
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,817
He risks his life to rescue babies.

88
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,070
And he's the kind of guy who,
if left on his own,

89
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,654
would help those in trouble all day!

90
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,458
That's a nice sound.

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,045
I still hadn't thanked you
for fixing this for me.

92
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,255
Don't worry about it.

93
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,468
Hey!

94
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,179
Stop playing that right now!

95
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,472
If you don't...

96
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,351
Neji. What's the big idea?!

97
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,894
You keep quiet!

98
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,978
What?!

99
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,563
It's as Neji says.

100
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,233
That might've been
a signal to an enemy!

101
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,567
A signal?

102
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,862
Lady Tsunade approved this mission
because the suspicious person

103
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,032
who entered the village the other day
still hasn't been caught!

104
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,036
If that intruder has followed Menma...

105
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,873
he should be close to us now.

106
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,500
No way...

107
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,044
As of this point, he hasn't shown
his presence, though.

108
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,921
Our mission is to accompany Naruto,

109
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,217
verify his identity and
to capture the intruder!

110
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,929
Sorry, but I don't trust you!

111
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,268
That's right...
It's natural I'd be thought of like that...

112
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,438
I think about this
from time to time...

113
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,400
What kind of a person was I?

114
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,154
What would I do if I were
a bad person...?

115
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:29,825
Naruto, what kind of person would
you want to be if you were reborn?

116
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,202
Wh-What's this all of a sudden?

117
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,287
I'm speaking figuratively...

118
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,082
I've never thought about it.

119
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,167
I see...

120
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,460
But why do you ask
something like that?

121
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,172
Oh, no special reason...

122
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,426
What is it?

123
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,927
What's this smell?

124
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,639
Now that you mention it,
it smells like something's burning.

125
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,766
-Over there.
-Let's go.

126
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,275
The smell came from here...

127
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,737
Was there a fire or something...?

128
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,260
Is something wrong?

129
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,929
No...

130
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,597
It's nothing.

131
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,906
Don't move. I'll fire if you move.

132
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,325
What's the deal all of a sudden?

133
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,202
Are you their minions?

134
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,453
"Their"?

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,081
You'll die here if
you're comrades of theirs.

136
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,541
For crying out loud, who are they?!

137
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,794
If you say you're not,
then show me some proof!

138
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,422
Proof, why? We're Leaf Shinobi.

139
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,507
Hidden Leaf Village?

140
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,884
See? Look at this.

141
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,386
Indeed that is...

142
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,057
What do Leaf Shinobi want
in a place like this?

143
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,936
Well, we just happened
to be passing through and...

144
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,063
As you can see, there's nothing here.

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,482
If you don't have business here,
just beat it.

146
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,443
If you don't,
we can't guarantee your life.

147
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,696
What's with him talking all big?!

148
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,115
Here, he was the one
who picked the fight.

149
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,538
Once we've had our breather,

150
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,000
let's blow this joint and go look
for Menma's memory.

151
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,002
R-Right...

152
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,254
What? Did you remember something?

153
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,338
No...

154
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,090
Who's there? Come on out.

155
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,480
Hello.

156
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,113
Y-You guys are Ninja, right?

157
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,699
I heard what you were talking
about earlier...

158
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,952
Oh, well, I don't want to brag, but...

159
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,163
If you're talking about Naruto Uzumaki
from Hidden Leaf Village,

160
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,540
I'm pretty well known.

161
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,251
Really? I'm sorry, I didn't know.

162
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,379
Why did you go to the trouble
of following us?

163
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,590
Umm... I had a favor to ask...

164
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,509
My older brother said
what he did earlier, but...

165
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,677
Older brother?!

166
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,721
That jerk from earlier?

167
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,391
We need someone to save our village!

168
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,356
A person to save your village...?

169
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,565
What do you mean?

170
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,568
This was the border of
the Land of Rice Paddies.

171
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,070
But...

172
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,199
as our land had caused trouble
for other lands,

173
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,494
this area was turned into
a demilitarized zone.

174
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,662
Are you talking about
that thing in question...?

175
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,998
It must be the incident
involving Orochimaru.

176
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,668
That's how things were settled
with all the neighboring lands, huh?

177
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:13,382
But if it's a demilitarized zone,
there won't be any territorial dispute, right?

178
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,966
That's right.

179
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,927
It's not like that.

180
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,221
There's a small mine
in the hills behind the village

181
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,515
and a little bit of gold can be dug up.

182
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,683
Once it was discovered that mine is not
being supervised by a proprietary land,

183
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,521
bandits started coming with
their eyes on the gold...

184
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,065
No matter how often we asked
the feudal lord,

185
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:34,236
he would insist that, "Agreements between
fellow lands must not be broken."

186
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,695
And the village...

187
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,573
It was attacked by bandits, right?

188
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,578
They withdrew in the middle of it
due to a terrible storm before.

189
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,456
But they'll definitely be back.

190
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,209
I beg you. Please save our village.

191
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,628
You guys could fight them!

192
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,004
All right! Got it...

193
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,339
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,758
We can understand the situation,
but we can't cooperate.

195
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,970
Huh? What're you saying, Neji?!

196
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,972
We're in the middle of a mission!

197
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,016
We can't act unless
we have an official order from the village!

198
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,268
But...

199
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,312
Besides, we don't know
when the bandits will be back.

200
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,190
We can't just strand
ourselves here forever!

201
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,192
Damn it...

202
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,444
I see...

203
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,447
What're you doing Ran,
even bringing Fuki here?

204
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,573
Big Brother...

205
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,452
Don't get involved with them.
There's no such thing as a good Ninja.

206
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,536
Say what?!

207
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,621
I just stated the truth.

208
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,832
The rumor has it that the guys who
attacked the village were Rogue Shinobi

209
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,459
from the Hidden Sound Village.

210
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,462
Huh? The bandits are Ninja?

211
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,046
Come this way.

212
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,634
Look at that.

213
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,387
Wh-What's this?!

214
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,391
One-third of the villagers were killed
in the attack the other day.

215
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,644
Half of the rest abandoned
the village and fled.

216
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,521
Then you guys should also evacuate...

217
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,064
Where are we supposed to flee?!

218
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,067
This is ancestral land
that's been handed down to us

219
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,819
and that we've cultivated.

220
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,905
Why should we have to flee from that?!

221
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,491
Each time the hooligans
brandish their power,

222
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,409
we have to accept it like
a natural disaster and do nothing?!

223
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,744
Are we to just flee from place to place?!

224
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,663
Don't shout, Big Brother.

225
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,582
Fuki will get scared.

226
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,086
I'm sorry I shouted...

227
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:20,425
Her parents were killed by bandits
and she lost her ability to speak.

228
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,346
There's no place for us to escape.

229
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,431
If that's clear, then beat it already.

230
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,521
We have no choice.
Let's hurry on ahead.

231
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,108
-I'm staying here.
-Huh?

232
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,780
I want to be of use if
those people are in trouble.

233
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,948
Menma!

234
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,868
Hey, you don't even know
the scale of the bandits.

235
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,411
If you want to help them,
no matter what,

236
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,996
then we should go back
to the village and...

237
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,582
We don't know when they might attack.

238
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,668
We don't have the time
to return to the village!

239
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,045
Then, I'm staying, too!

240
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,756
Naruto! Anything further than this
is beyond the scope of the mission!

241
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,341
This isn't beyond the scope
of the mission!

242
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,594
I get the feeling I'll be able to
remember something if I stay here.

243
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,430
Don't say irresponsible things!

244
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,599
You couldn't remember anything
just a moment ago...

245
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,059
That's too convenient!

246
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,522
It can't be helped, right?
Menma himself is saying so.

247
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,234
He's good-natured to a fault!

248
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,860
Naruto...

249
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,071
-Let's go, Menma.
-Right.

250
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,406
Hey, Naruto!

251
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,075
We'll deal with the bandits.

252
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,412
You guys go on back
to the village ahead.

253
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,330
What do we do, Neji?!

254
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,665
Leave them be.

255
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,002
It's unlikely the villagers will
accept Naruto and Menma.

256
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,587
You've got a point...

257
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,092
It seems the settlement on the other side
has escaped damage, huh?

258
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,554
But how're we supposed to protect
the village just the two of us...?

259
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,309
Let's build a wall along this creek.
This river will play the role of a moat.

260
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,061
Ultimately we'll make a temporary bridge

261
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,938
and have the entrance to the village
in just one location.

262
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,273
I get it...

263
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,192
I don't know how effective it'll be,

264
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,944
but let's just do the best
we can now.

265
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,654
Right.

266
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,185
What're you doing? I told you to get out.

267
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,271
We won't get out!

268
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,356
What did you say?!

269
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,901
We decided to protect
the village on our own.

270
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,529
Nobody asked you to do that.
It's none of your business!

271
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,156
You may say that,

272
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,701
but you can't beat them off
by just hiding in your houses!

273
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,830
All right, let's stabilize it with a stake.

274
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,956
Got it...

275
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,878
Jeez, what can they do
just the two of them?!

276
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,261
-I'm ready...
-Okay.

277
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,190
Tenten! You're still here?!

278
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,068
Can't you at least say thanks first?

279
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,529
Thanks, Tenten.

280
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,283
Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.

281
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,784
R-Right...

282
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,752
You are...

283
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,545
For me?

284
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,130
Then I'll help myself.

285
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,217
Have this, too.

286
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,886
I'll help out, too.

287
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,945
You're mine!
Not yet!

288
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,157
That technique!

289
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,661
It's from that time!

290
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,414
Neji! You...

291
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,751
It's our mission this time around
to catch this guy.

292
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,629
Heh! This guy's formidable.

293
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,685
Damn it!

294
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,854
He's quick to escape!

295
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,577
Naruto!

296
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,090
The sound waves pierced my whole
Chakra Network all at once

297
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,301
and amplified the flow of Chakra?

298
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,388
I won't lose to the likes of this guy
if I have this Jutsu!

299
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,035
This is to avenge everyone.

300
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,536
Eat this!

301
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,164
You're in my way!

302
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,380
Menma!

303
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,302
Menma! Menma!

304
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,346
Carry him to the village.

305
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,848
Manma! Hang in there!

306
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:24,974
Boiling water and alcohol!

307
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,142
All right.

308
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,395
Are you going to treat him?

309
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,690
I may not look it,
but I've played at being a doctor.

310
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,485
We'll save you now, Menma.

311
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,571
What's the matter?

312
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,828
I cannot treat this guy...

313
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,705
Wh-Why not?!

314
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,041
This mark...

315
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,128
He's a comrade of a guy
who attacked here...!

316
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,186
The Key to the rusted heart's door

317
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:16,025
Will always be smiling right near by

318
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,536
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

319
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,207
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

320
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,712
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

321
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,717
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

322
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,096
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

323
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,642
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

324
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:54,397
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

325
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

326
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,992
The wind is probably testing our hearts

327
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,747
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

328
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,168
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

329
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,339
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

330
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,886
The Key to the rusted heart's door

331
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,682
Will always be smiling right near by

332
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,734
Menma is not a member of the bandits.

333
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,237
I mean, he loves helping people!

334
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:48,576
He's a type of guy who would even risk
his own life in order to save a kid!

335
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,244
For this village too,

336
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,539
he has worked hard, so hard,
even though no one really asked for it.

337
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,583
He's got to have some kind of reason.

338
00:22:56,334 --> 00:23:00,213
So please save Menma!

339
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,132
Next time: "A Past to Be Erased"
