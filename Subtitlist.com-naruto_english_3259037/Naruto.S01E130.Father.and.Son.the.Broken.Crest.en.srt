1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

6
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,795
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,831
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,796
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,816
With this, you've woken up, right?

21
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,697
We had a hindrance back then...

22
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,407
but it won't be like that this time.

23
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:04,083
I'll show you...
the true power of Sharingan.

24
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,546
Fine...Then I'll go all out too!

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,969
You take a good look with your Sharingan...

26
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,137
at my Way of Ninja!

27
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,559
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

28
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,314
You can't beat me by just pointlessly...
increasing the number!

29
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,735
You little...!

30
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,704
I can spot the real body in
one shot with my Sharingan.

31
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,583
I deliberately went along with your game...

32
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,129
I won't go easy on you now!

33
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,305
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

34
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,582
Father-Son: The Broken Crest

35
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:52,524
What was up...
with those eyes of Big Brother's?

36
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,279
That wasn't... just an ordinary Sharingan.

37
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,997
And...quite a bit of time's
passed since then...

38
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,417
but things are still kind of awkward
between him and Father.

39
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,566
Good morning, Father...

40
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,529
Yeah, good morning.

41
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,992
Sasuke... how have things
been going at the Academy lately?

42
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,123
It's boring with just school classes.

43
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm always number one, so...

44
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,006
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

45
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,513
W-Wow...

46
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,516
This is the fundamental
Jutsu of the Uchiha.

47
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,478
The Sign is as I taught you earlier.

48
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,354
You build up Chakra,

49
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,857
stop it once at around between
the mouth and the chest area,

50
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,901
and spew it out at once after that.

51
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,237
-Try it.
-Okay!

52
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,786
Father...is teaching me Jutsu himself.

53
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,999
Finally... Father has also recognized me!

54
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,584
I must live up to his expectations!

55
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,547
I too can...!

56
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,426
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

57
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,855
Sure enough, it won't go like
it did with Itachi, huh?

58
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,737
It might've still been too soon for you.

59
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,700
A member of the Uchiha Clan
is not recognized as full-fledged

60
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,619
until they can use the Fire Style.

61
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,004
The Uchiha crest...

62
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,590
means those who possess
the Uchiha that controls fire.

63
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,514
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

64
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,019
Damn it! One more time!

65
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,273
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

66
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,867
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

67
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,127
Today for sure!

68
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,922
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

69
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,556
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

70
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,026
Sasuke...!

71
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,403
Wait a minute.

72
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,946
What is it?

73
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,038
What...?

74
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,373
Oh... Don't move.

75
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,925
Okay, finished!

76
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,223
-Mother...
-Hmm?

77
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,189
No... It's nothing.

78
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,273
Okay...

79
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,953
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

80
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,216
Sure enough, it won't go
like it did with Itachi, huh?

81
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,137
It might've still been too soon for you...

82
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:21,270
I'm just, getting started.
Damn it! One more time!

83
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,524
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

84
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,077
Father!

85
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,581
One more time...

86
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,169
One more time... Please join me.

87
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,964
It's still too soon for you.

88
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,633
Even if I were to teach you
for only after a week...

89
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,720
It's not that...

90
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,598
I've gotten...the hang of the Jutsu.

91
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,600
So I want you to see it.

92
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,668
Failure is not an option!

93
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,087
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

94
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,726
That's my boy.

95
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,731
You've done well.

96
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,859
From now on, improve yourself
and soar large

97
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,404
so as not to bring shame
to the crest on your back.

98
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,701
Right!

99
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,371
And...let me say one thing.

100
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,041
Don't chase after
your older brother anymore.

101
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,973
Mother...?

102
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:11,815
What does Father really think of
Big Brother and me?

103
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,277
What is it all of a sudden?

104
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:24,244
The other day, Father said to me,
"That's my boy."

105
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,997
He'd always said that only to Big Brother.

106
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,958
So I was really happy.

107
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,627
I see...Good for you.

108
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,091
But lately, Father and Brother
haven't been getting along, so...

109
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,430
I was thinking...

110
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,017
that I might just be
a replacement for Big Brother.

111
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,903
Your older brother's your older brother.
And you are you.

112
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,989
Your father cares deeply about you both.

113
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,992
Then why does he only think
about Big Brother?!

114
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,495
That's not it...

115
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,039
Your father has to protect the Uchiha Clan

116
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,209
as a representative of the clan.

117
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,960
What about it?!

118
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,048
Itachi is just bigger than you
and is your elder.

119
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,758
He'll naturally be entrusted

120
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,885
with that much more work
for the clan, right?

121
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,473
Your father is the supervisor
of the work, so...

122
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,352
it might be that his eyes were
likely to go towards your older brother.

123
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,361
But, this is just between us.

124
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,780
When he's with me,

125
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,282
your father does nothing
but talk about you.

126
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,250
He's just always sullen and awkward, so...

127
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,062
I'll catch up to Big Brother
no matter what!

128
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,121
Damn it...!

129
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,046
Big Brother's back is still
far out of reach.

130
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,022
Forgive me, Sasuke... Maybe another time.

131
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,527
Clan...Clan...

132
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,823
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own "vessels"

133
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,620
and don't know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there.

134
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,671
My "vessel" is
dismayed at this foolish clan.

135
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,717
I feel like...ever since that day,

136
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,678
he hasn't been the same as he was before.

137
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,479
Big Brother...

138
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,524
Today, when school's finished,

139
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,110
will you join me for
some Shuriken Jutsu training?

140
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:49,616
I'm busy.
You should have Father teach you.

141
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,123
But even I know that you're better
at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.

142
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,670
You always treat me like
a nuisance like that.

143
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,479
Forgive me, Sasuke. Maybe next time...

144
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,247
I don't have the time to
be dealing with you today.

145
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,713
You always say, "Forgive me, Sasuke,"
and poke me on the forehead.

146
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,383
and you say "today," but it never happens.

147
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,890
Thank goodness... he's the same as before.

148
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,734
Big Brother...

149
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,034
His eyes looking back at Father that time...

150
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,622
It wasn't just an ordinary Sharingan...

151
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,542
And...

152
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,087
Father...?

153
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,550
Are there several types of Sharingan?

154
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,263
Oh...You're already interested in Sharingan?

155
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,185
However, it's still too soon for you.

156
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,521
It's totally different from
the Fire Style Jutsu.

157
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,273
But someday, I too...!

158
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,235
After all... I'm your kid, so.

159
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:56,242
Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu
above the Sharingan,

160
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,203
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

161
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,663
Mangekyo Sharingan...

162
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,459
In the long history of the Uchiha,

163
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,630
it's a legendary Visual Jutsu
that only a few develop.

164
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:15,303
And it's said that it only opened
under a particular condition.

165
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,099
A particular condition...?

166
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,530
Don't chase after your
older brother anymore.

167
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,494
I wonder what he thinks of my
relationship with Brother?

168
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,081
Father...

169
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,961
Why doesn't Big Brother care about me?

170
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,591
He's a bit peculiar...

171
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,887
He's a type of person who doesn't
care for making friends with people.

172
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,139
Why?

173
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,225
Who knows...?

174
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,355
Even I, his father, can't read that boy.

175
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,112
Here I spoke because I wanted
more of Big Brother's attention.

176
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,865
Father isn't against it.

177
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,826
Here, Sasuke! Your box lunch.

178
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,789
I'll watch your Shuriken practice
after you come home.

179
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,751
It's not practice, it's training!

180
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,087
I'm off!

181
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,215
That's good...

182
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,221
It's not that Father dislikes
Big Brother, after all.

183
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,643
Big Brother graduated from the Academy
at the top of his class at age seven.

184
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,897
He learned to use
the Sharingan at age eight.

185
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,482
And he was promoted to Chunin at age ten.

186
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,570
But, I've got the same Uchiha blood
flowing inside me as he does.

187
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,114
I won't lose to him!

188
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,671
You're not gonna tell me this is
the best you can do, are you?

189
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,841
You boast about your Way of Ninja
and this is all you've got?

190
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,266
Are you still thinking that
I'm a member of your comrade game?

191
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,688
If that's the case, you're...

192
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,107
a hopeless fool!

193
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,904
Stop wasting time!

194
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,739
Give me all you've got,

195
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,325
you number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja!

196
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,400
When I recalled the parts one by one,

197
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,823
I felt as though
I had understood everything

198
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

199
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:32,792
which I kept so close to me

200
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:38,172
Speechless nights,

201
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,593
a hint of warmth,

202
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,142
and this distant yearning for you

203
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,145
I live,

204
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:57,817
simply repeating this cycle

205
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:06,868
Held in my two hands

206
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,954
A droplet of time

207
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,837
Softly clutching forgotten memories

208
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

209
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,144
I'll keep these thoughts...

210
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,816
Just as Neji said,

211
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,736
it seems Sasuke's in
the darkness right now.

212
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,615
Damn it.
He really did hit me with all his might.

213
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:51,079
Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade
or anything anymore?!

214
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:55,374
Don't all those things we
did together in Squad Seven

215
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,960
mean anything to you?!

216
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,464
