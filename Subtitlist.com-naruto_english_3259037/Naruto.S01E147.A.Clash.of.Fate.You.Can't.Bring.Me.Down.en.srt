1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:16,142
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,479
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,738
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,420
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,018
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,670
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:35,846
A Clash of Fate: You Can't Bring Me Down!

21
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:43,938
What incredible Chakra...
It's making my skin tingle.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,315
My nose too...

23
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,612
Mizuki...

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,160
What's the matter? Aren't you coming?

25
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,871
You jerk...!

26
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,040
Hey, Naruto! Stop that!

27
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,003
You idiot.

28
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,343
Naruto!

29
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,096
Hey, hey. Should you really be worrying
about others right now?

30
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,639
He's fast!

31
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,438
And what's more, such power...

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,028
So this is the power Lord Orochimaru
was talking about...

33
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,408
Amazing... It's almost scary...

34
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,703
Don't you agree, Iruka?

35
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,084
Mizuki, please stop.

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,045
Please...!

37
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,050
Tsubaki...

38
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,469
I don't care what happens to me...

39
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,639
I just don't want you to
commit any more crimes.

40
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,434
Please!

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,978
Return to the village.

42
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,611
Tsubaki... If you care that much about me,

43
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,113
then you could at least be useful to me!

44
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,950
Tsubaki...!

45
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,166
What?!
You're so slow.

46
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,423
Iruka Sensei...!

47
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,133
Damn!

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,010
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

49
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,224
Hasty as always, huh...

50
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,101
You sure haven't made
any progress, have you?

51
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,231
He vanished!
He didn't vanish. He's just fast.

52
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,903
That guy's been accelerating since earlier
and moving into our blind spots...

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,196
In that case...

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,367
Everybody, better be very aware
of your surroundings!

55
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,535
I call it Uzumaki Whirpool Formation!

56
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,912
– Right!
– Right!

57
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,295
I see...

58
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,798
Even an idiot like him comes up
with an idea once in a while.

59
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,549
In that case...

60
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,927
I want to watch you experience
even deeper despair...

61
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,013
Despair that's equal to that wisdom
you've managed to muster!

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,349
There he is!
I see him!

63
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,643
It's not that you saw me.

64
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm going out of my way
to show myself to you.

65
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,863
There!

66
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,540
Damn... Even though I can see him,
I'm unable to land any blows.

67
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm telling you, I'm not foreseeing
your movements.

68
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,129
You're just sluggish.

69
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,011
Oww...

70
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,974
Hey, serves you right.

71
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,643
You demon fox.

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,527
Don't be so delighted in such a big way.

73
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,741
You'll now get a taste of
the same agony I have endured.

74
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,285
Starting now, right, Naruto?

75
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,414
There's still much more to come!

76
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,382
Stop that, Mizuki!
Don't lay your hands on Naruto!

77
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,676
Shut up, Iruka!

78
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,805
Do you have any idea how much
I've been waiting for this moment?

79
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,559
I've been waiting for this day
ever since then.

80
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,228
For this time of revenge.

81
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,773
I will use this power of mine

82
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,233
and take my own good time
to crush each of you, one at a time.

83
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:03,113
Come on, stand up, Iruka.
I'll start by killing this guy.

84
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,908
Mizuki...!

85
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,036
There you go. That's good!

86
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,205
Come on!

87
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,751
You are pathetic.

88
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,670
There's a world of difference
between us, isn't there?

89
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,301
I've gotten my hands on this extreme body

90
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,804
and it is your fate to die wretchedly.

91
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,099
What do you mean, "extreme body"?

92
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,893
When your power depends on potions,

93
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,895
it's not true power!

94
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,981
That sounds just like
the half-baked guy you are...

95
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,651
In that case, go ahead and try winning...

96
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,737
Using that real power
you're talking about!

97
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,575
I'm different from you.
You're gonna live out your life...

98
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,702
as some lowly teacher who never thinks
about getting ahead in life,

99
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,039
who only gets used by the village
in whatever way they see fit.

100
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,252
How do you like...this power...
and the way I carry myself?!

101
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,712
Even if you trained a hundred years,

102
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,132
you'll never be able to earn it!

103
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,055
I'm not gonna stop here!

104
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,850
I'm still gonna get much much stronger...

105
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,311
I'll get Orochimaru to share
his Hidden Jutsu with me.

106
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,566
Do you really think that will happen?

107
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,862
I'm getting tired of you
playing the martyr.

108
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,406
I think it's about time to end this.

109
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,367
Isn't this nostalgic...?

110
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,288
This time, I'll get you for sure.

111
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,081
So prepare yourself.

112
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,806
Naruto!

113
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,316
You jerk! Don't you dare lay
your hands on Iruka Sensei!

114
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,490
This is really something!

115
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,911
Every little thing is exactly the same
as it was that other time.

116
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,042
But I've changed.

117
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,420
The reason for my defeat that time...

118
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,716
was that I let my guard down
to the demon fox that you are.

119
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,730
Wh-What's that?!

120
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,942
I won't let my guard down again.

121
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,445
I'll call upon all my strength
to beat you down!

122
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,907
Bring it on!

123
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,665
I'm sorry...both of you...

124
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,380
Choji!

125
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,931
Damn... If only I had a little more
information about those guys...

126
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,980
Elder Brother... My body feels lighter.

127
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,109
Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter,
doesn't it?

128
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,528
Okay, time for clobbering...

129
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,697
Yeah! Clobbering!

130
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,911
There they come.

131
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,289
Damn it!

132
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,964
Huh?

133
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,008
What the hell is this?!

134
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,343
M-My body...

135
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,137
Doesn't move...!

136
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,974
Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?

137
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,893
Looks like I made it in time.

138
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,107
Good work! Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!

139
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,109
Leave the rest to me!

140
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,320
The F-Fifth Hokage!

141
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,282
No way... Lady Hokage...in person?!

142
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,242
Lady Tsunade.

143
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,915
I'm sorry I found out about this so late.

144
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,584
But I wouldn't have imagined

145
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,379
that these guys were
hanging out with Mizuki...

146
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,089
Fifth Hokage!

147
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,507
We are saved...!

148
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,848
Uh...uh...Elder Brother...

149
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,266
Oh...Oh...

150
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,020
Well, we run into each other
in unusual places, don't we,

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,022
Fujin and Raijin?

152
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,527
T-Tsunade...

153
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,655
Let me ask what you're doing here.

154
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,541
Powerful.

155
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,752
More like, scary.

156
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:13,090
Now then, is there something
you want to say?

157
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,342
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

158
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,011
Please forgive me.
We'll never do it again!

159
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,266
So you guys went with Mizuki
because he told you that

160
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,229
you'd be able to eat something good
at Orochimaru's place?

161
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,689
– I'm, I'm sorry.
– I'm, I'm sorry.

162
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,402
No way we could stand up to guys on the
same level as the Three Legendary Ninja.

163
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,195
But I wonder what happened
between them the past...

164
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,072
to make those two that scared.

165
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,408
No thanks. I don't even want
to imagine what it might be.

166
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,245
Gimme a break.
Falling for such an obvious bait!

167
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,874
Mizuki has apparently gone
into those mountains up ahead.

168
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,419
Naruto and Iruka are probably with him...

169
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,630
You guys come along
after recuperating a little.

170
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,091
Huh...wait a minute.

171
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,552
What are we going to do
with these two guys?

172
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,888
Huh? You don't need to worry about that...

173
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,766
More importantly, I can't let them
cause any more trouble.

174
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,353
I've decided to make these guys
go home on their own.

175
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:13,024
Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume
you understand this already,

176
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,694
but if you're even one minute late
you're not getting any dinner.

177
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,404
– Yes, ma'am!
– Yes, ma'am!

178
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,949
We can't be doing this, Raijin.

179
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,160
Let's hurry back to the institution.

180
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,287
Elder Brother, dinner, right?!

181
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,580
Dinner!

182
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,709
– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner...
– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner...

183
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,588
Amazing... what incredible speed.

184
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,883
It's very important for
a person to eat, after all.

185
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,677
That's just you.

186
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,316
Damn! His power is
even greater than earlier!

187
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,531
But I can't let him take me down.

188
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,993
This guy may have a lead
to Sasuke's whereabouts.

189
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,245
Naruto!

190
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,207
Iruka, are you all right?
Yes...

191
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,126
Did you notice?
What?

192
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,296
Although that jerk's power
has increased multifold,

193
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,466
the sharpness of his movements
is diminishing.

194
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,967
Huh?

195
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,179
Did he transfer the Chakra
he was using for speed, to power?

196
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,931
I don't really know that, but...

197
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,019
That's quite a heavy burden
for Naruto to bear alone.

198
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,563
But if that guy's speed has diminished,

199
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,649
there might be a chance to win.

200
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,027
All right... You hang in there
a little bit more, Naruto!

201
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,239
How about this, you little brat?

202
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,492
Do you like the power of this body
that Lord Orochimaru gave me!

203
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,288
I'll tear you apart.

204
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,252
Where the hell is he...?

205
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,631
That Orochimaru... Where is he?

206
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,884
Why would I tell a little brat
like you that kind of thing?

207
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,512
He wasn't in
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

208
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,224
The Village Hidden in the Sound?
Did you go there?!

209
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,352
The compound was already totally empty...

210
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,939
Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru
was there anymore.

211
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,527
You really gave that one
a lot of thought for a guy like you, huh...

212
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,531
I don't know where you heard that
about the Village Hidden in the Sound...

213
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,909
but if you're trying to fluster me
by talking rubbish like that,

214
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,537
it's not gonna happen.

215
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,832
Give up 'cause you're going
to the next world.

216
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,921
Listen carefully. Don't you dare talk
that kind of trash again!

217
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,765
Naruto, this way.

218
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,726
Iruka Sensei...

219
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,696
Just try to catch me!

220
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,824
You jerk...don't even think
I'm gonna let you get away!

221
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,124
Now! Jump up, Naruto!

222
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,209
All right!!

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,465
Damn...this is...!

224
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,635
Seal and Capture Perimeter!

225
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,513
The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!

226
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,645
Rasengan!

227
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,356
Naruto, that Jutsu is...

228
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,331
So that's the Fourth Hokage's
Jutsu... Rasengan...

229
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,920
Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?

230
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,131
Naruto, that was spectacular. Good work!

231
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,466
Listen Sensei...

232
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,469
It looks like this guy didn't know
about the Village Hidden in the Sound.

233
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,596
So I was thinking that he's no longer...
with Orochimaru...

234
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,973
Don't talk trash...

235
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,478
Mizuki...

236
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,730
You gotta be kidding...

237
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,109
This is an extreme body that
I received from Lord Orochimaru...

238
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,861
I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound
and become even more...

239
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,989
Iruka Sensei What's this?!

240
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,867
It's just as I thought, after all.

241
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,953
Old Lady Tsunade...

242
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,579
Lady Tsunade.

243
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,041
His cells have started dying.

244
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,877
You jerk... What have you done to me?!

245
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,338
It's not Naruto's fault.

246
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,716
It's caused from the substances you took!

247
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,051
What? That's impossible!

248
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,512
You're getting a taste of
your own medicine.

249
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,890
That substance wasn't fully developed yet.

250
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,689
The last casualty has been recovered.

251
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,736
It appears that Shizune was injured,
but there's no threat to her life.

252
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,904
I see. Thanks for your work.

253
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,576
That's a relief... Shizune is safe.

254
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:20,206
Orochimaru probably developed
that substance by chance

255
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,292
while he was trying to develop
a Forbidden Jutsu.

256
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,170
What is certain is that

257
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,172
that substance assimilates
the DNA of animals

258
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,007
and when it combines with the human body

259
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,593
that serves to draw out its power
in an explosive manner.

260
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,180
But its effect is only short term.

261
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,934
And in exchange,
it puts a strain on the cells

262
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,021
that far exceeds the limits
of the human body.

263
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,024
It certainly isn't something
that's one could actually use.

264
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,403
But why did Mizuki...?

265
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,947
I don't know the details

266
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,033
but it must be that Mizuki and Orochimaru

267
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,660
had a point of contact in the past...

268
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,329
However...

269
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,122
That tie has already been severed.

270
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:06,002
Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru
just used him as a plaything.

271
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:10,715
Giving him an unusable drug...
he's probably laughing his butt off.

272
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,760
But Mizuki is one lucky guy...

273
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,764
An ordinary Shinobi would
have lost his life.

274
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,810
Although he won't be able to live
his life as a Shinobi any more.

275
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,980
Unfortunate, isn't it, Naruto?

276
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,526
I kind of had that feeling anyway...

277
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,693
I see.

278
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,071
But I won't give up!

279
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,990
I will continue to do my best to search
for clues to Sasuke's whereabouts.

280
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,829
Tsubaki...

281
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,748
Damn it, Iruka!

282
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,124
Don't talk!

283
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,170
Next time I'll take you and that
little squirt down without fail.

284
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,589
There's no way you could do that.

285
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,634
While you were pursuing your futile dream,

286
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,678
Naruto's been actively honing his skills.

287
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,014
You can't possibly catch up
with him any longer.

288
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,353
Mizuki can never go back
to being a Shinobi again...

289
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,437
Tsubaki...

290
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm thinking of starting over again too...

291
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,487
But first I must atone for
all the trouble I caused the village...

292
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,825
What a beautiful sunset.

293
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,621
Let's return to the village.

294
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,416
Dried and Canned Goods

295
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,293
Fish Market

296
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,676
I won't...

297
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,554
ever give up either!

298
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,563
I did it!

299
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,863
All right, since everybody
worked so hard today,

300
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,408
I'm going to do something special
and treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.

301
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,870
Yippee! You're a real man, Iruka Sensei!

302
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,205
I want a block of barbecued pork!

303
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,207
I want large portions of
all three kinds of ramen noodles –

304
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,168
miso, soy sauce and butter!

305
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,170
Hey, Iruka, before you do that,

306
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,881
you and Naruto need to go
to Leaf Village Hospital.

307
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,592
Huh...I told you I'm okay.

308
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,260
Don't argue with me.

309
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,137
Lady Tsunade!

310
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,559
I cleared the first stage!

311
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,608
She's just started her ascetic training...

312
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,029
Could she be an exceptional talent
on par with Shizune...?

313
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,991
Hey, Sakura...!

314
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,622
This time you saved me...

315
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:55,129
You've really become stronger,
haven't you, Naruto.

316
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,237
Crappy news pass us by

317
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,448
And you become speechless

318
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,538
My voice is way too soft

319
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,958
So you don't answer

320
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

321
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

322
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

323
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,518
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

324
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,230
Yeah

325
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

326
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,656
Yeah

327
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

328
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,082
Yeah

329
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:18,880
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

330
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:25,178
Yeah

331
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,150
I can't stand it any longer!

332
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,987
No matter how long I wait, there's no clue
about Sasuke's whereabouts!

333
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:47,450
And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps
telling me not to do a thing!

334
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,286
At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!

335
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,746
Isn't there anything?

336
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,709
Something, anything...
a clue to finding Sasuke!

337
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:01,297
