1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,128
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,881
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,930
I'll show you there are walls

19
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,934
which effort alone can
never break through.

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,281
Sakura Blossoms!

21
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,097
Huh?!

22
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,268
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.

23
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:29,441
But our Jutsu exceeds that
and is the speed of sound!

24
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,697
Lee!

25
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,500
My left ear...

26
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,630
There's a little gimmick I have.

27
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:58,762
Evading won't work...
on my attacks.

28
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,141
What is he going to do?!

29
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,313
It's sound.

30
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,901
Even though you evaded my fist,
sound assaulted you.

31
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,694
Sound?

32
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:20,117
Do you know what sound is
all about in the first place?

33
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,077
Vibration?

34
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:27,583
Correct. In other words,
hearing sounds means,

35
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:33,339
that the eardrum is
catching vibrating air.

36
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:40,346
And the human eardrum breaks
with sounds over 150 Mhz.

37
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,186
Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal
which is located even deeper,

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,357
I can make you totally lose balance.

39
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:01,450
You won't be able to move your body
freely for sometime.

40
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,830
Something old and tired
like Taijutsu don't work on us.

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,293
Well, you were doing good
up to a certain point,

42
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,671
but I brought forth my Jutsu.

43
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,215
It's just not gonna work anymore.

44
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,180
I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves
and air pressure,

45
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,141
and have the power to
obliterate even boulders!

46
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,519
Primary Lotus!

47
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,816
I can send air into the ground

48
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,152
and change the dirt into
a cushion as I please.

49
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,157
It's different from
your silly Jutsu.

50
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,500
Blast it!

51
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,301
Lee, it is all right to use
this Jutsu

52
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,972
to protect someone precious.

53
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,309
Protect...someone precious?

54
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,149
In any case,

55
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,777
I'm impressed that you
were able to master it, little man!

56
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,073
You did it quite well, Lee!

57
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,660
Darn it!

58
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,705
Okay, then!

59
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,915
Next is...

60
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,375
You!

61
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,586
Darn it!
He's coming!

62
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,010
What?!
No way!

63
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,261
Lee!

64
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,680
Leaf...
Hurricane!

65
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:52,144
It looks like my earlier attack
is having an effect!

66
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm somewhat surprised...

67
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,235
but there's not even a trace of
that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,080
This arm amplifies sounds
from within to its maximum.

69
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,707
It's a speaker of sorts!

70
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,543
Lee!

71
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,756
And the assault sound isn't limited
by the direction of my arm...

72
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,011
it always converges on
the targeted prey by my Chakra!

73
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,387
Lee!

74
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,270
Now then...
The final blow.

75
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,272
I won't let you!

76
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,529
Oh, well.

77
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,782
Hey, let's get outta here!

78
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,493
Those guys are pretty dangerous!

79
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,914
It looks like Sasuke and Naruto
are only unconscious, but...

80
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,543
even that guy Lee's been
messed up and Sakura's alone.

81
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,420
What're you gonna do, Ino?

82
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,048
What do you mean?

83
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,677
Well, Sakura's in deep trouble!

84
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,220
You're all right with that?

85
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,304
Huh?!

86
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,850
You two were once close friends,
weren't you?

87
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,151
By the way...

88
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,825
What Sakura, don't be so stiff!

89
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,619
Well...

90
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,247
Ino, I hear you also...

91
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,167
What is it?

92
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,213
...like Sasuke.

93
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,685
Then, that means from now on,

94
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,520
you and I are rivals.

95
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,826
Why...why am I recalling things
from that time?

96
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,996
Hey, Ino!

97
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,373
What're you gonna do?!

98
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,752
I know, but there's nothing I can do!

99
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,837
I can't heedlessly
go out there, can I?!

100
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,593
Even if I went out now...

101
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,223
I'd be taken down without a doubt.

102
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,227
I also...
I also...!

103
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,527
Air pressure!
The shurikens got bounced back?!

104
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,249
Your hair's shinier than mine.

105
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,086
Hey! If you have time to worry
about your hair,

106
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,462
you should practice!

107
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,507
Getting all spiced up like a woman...

108
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:15,055
Why don't you kill that Sasuke guy
right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?

109
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,349
Yeah! That sounds great!

110
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,017
Hey hey...

111
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,228
I won't let you do such a thing!

112
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,312
Don't move!

113
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,650
Sakura.

114
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:33,031
My body... It has no strength.

115
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,170
I...

116
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,760
Again...I'm just pulling everyone's feet!

117
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,681
I'm always being protected.

118
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,808
It's so frustrating!

119
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,813
This time for sure...
I had thought!

120
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,149
This time for sure...

121
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,778
I must protect people precious to me...
so I thought!

122
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,327
So...

123
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,828
Let's do this!

124
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,514
Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are
gonna get it, too!

125
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,437
W-What should I do?!

126
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,946
That's pointless!

127
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,742
That won't work on me!

128
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,539
What are you saying?

129
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,624
Huh?

130
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,042
What?!

131
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,491
I always...

132
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,870
act as if I'm a full-fledged Ninja.

133
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,960
I always say that I like Sasuke.

134
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,841
I always act like I know everything
and lecture Naruto.

135
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,390
I always just...watch them from behind.

136
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,686
And yet...

137
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,855
Tazuna, get back!

138
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,866
Get back!

139
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,750
Now then...

140
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,795
Let's get wild!

141
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,058
This is the only way to
take him down!

142
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,560
Sasuke!

143
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,034
Here it is!

144
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,040
Those two always covered
my back and fought for me.

145
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,345
Lee, you say that you like me...

146
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,516
I'll protect you until I die!

147
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,231
Primary Lotus!

148
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,068
With me at your back...

149
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,695
you risked your life and
fought for me.

150
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,617
I have a feeling that you taught me...

151
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,164
Sakura!

152
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,291
Sakura!

153
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,544
Humph!

154
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,131
I want to be like all of you!

155
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,179
This time...

156
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,640
I want all of you...

157
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,644
to watch me...

158
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,314
...from behind!

159
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,987
Sakura?

160
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,322
Sakura...

161
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,660
Kin! Kill her!

162
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,915
Huh! That sign...

163
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,715
Substitution Jutsu!

164
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,094
On the right, huh?
You think I'm a fool?

165
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,179
With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...

166
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,390
you think you can come at me?!

167
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,767
Kin, get out of the way!

168
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,520
Useless!

169
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,816
Air pressure 100 percent,
ultrasonic waves 0%, output...

170
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,319
Is that all you can do?

171
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,446
Slicing Sound Wave!

172
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,699
You're easy to spot...

173
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,117
You're above!

174
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,457
I've said it two or three times that
that won't work!

175
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,251
This is enough...for you!

176
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,715
Where next?

177
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,259
Huh?!

178
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,469
What...?!

179
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,847
This time...it's not a substitution!

180
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,651
Get off me! Hey!

181
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,531
Sakura...

182
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:02,128
You're always being called
"Billboard Brow" and being picked on.

183
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,591
Who're you?

184
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:11,763
I'm called Ino Yamanaka.
How 'bout you?

185
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,351
I'm...Sakura.

186
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:22,399
Huh? I can't hear you.
Say it louder.

187
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,735
Sakura Haruno!

188
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,572
Huh, I see.

189
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,991
You have a wide forehead.

190
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,661
So, Billboard Brow, huh...?

191
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,374
That's why you hide
your forehead with your bangs.

192
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,251
Like a ghost...

193
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,426
Sakura, was it?

194
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:50,927
Uh-huh...

195
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,640
Come back here tomorrow.

196
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,101
I'll give you something nice.

197
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,602
Huh?

198
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,981
Darn, let go!

199
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:09,279
See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!

200
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,406
I'll give you that ribbon.

201
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,159
T-Thanks.

202
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,370
But...

203
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,872
But what?

204
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,999
My forehead...

205
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,379
You hide it, so people make
more fun of you, you know?!

206
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,009
You have a cute face Sakura,
so you should be more confident!

207
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,677
More confident!

208
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,429
Ino...

209
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,687
Hey, who's that?
Who's she, Ino?

210
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,272
Her name's Sakura.

211
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,108
Hey, say hello!

212
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,278
Hello...

213
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,034
Listen everybody! Listen!

214
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,456
There's someone I like!
Who do you think it is?

215
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,416
Hurry up and tell us!

216
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,461
Don't say it's Sasuke?

217
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,422
Huh? Why'd you know?

218
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,382
What're you talking about?

219
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,886
Sasuke's really popular,
he's the most popular!

220
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,138
Huh? Is that so?

221
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:21,976
Oh no! I'll have a lot of rivals.
What should I do?!

222
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:27,774
Hey, Ino! Sakura's been upbeat lately!

223
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,237
She's just acting brave
and romping around!

224
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:42,664
Ino! I've heard Sasuke
likes girls with long hair.

225
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:48,628
...likes girls with long hair.
...likes girls with long hair.

226
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,463
Sakura...

227
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,426
I've heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.

228
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,722
From now on, we're rivals.

229
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,855
Your hair. It's grown quite a bit.

230
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,481
Ino...

231
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,108
Why...

232
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,780
Why are you on the
same team as Sasuke?!

233
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,742
I will not lose anymore...to you, Ino!

234
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:26,791
Me too! I won't lose to you, Sakura.
No matter what!

235
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,018
...Sakura!

236
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,691
I will...

237
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,026
I will...

238
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,876
Give it up!

239
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,045
It's really bad...

240
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,298
Hey, Ino...!

241
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,263
I must...protect everyone!

242
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,766
You punk!

243
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,905
Huh?

244
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,285
Huh! More strange ones.

245
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,578
Ino...?

246
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,794
Sakura! I promised
I wouldn't lose to you, didn't I?!

247
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:09,727
Hey, can you hear it?

248
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:14,941
The clear, blue sky

249
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,361
goes on and on

250
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,572
The ocean

251
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:27,662
spans limitlessly

252
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,500
Please keep that smile

253
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,421
on your face forever

254
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:42,802
Or else I'll cry

255
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,681
You won't have to search around you

256
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,727
It's all ok now.

257
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,065
Everyone is inside

258
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,527
this hand

259
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,699
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

260
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:09,203
When you forget what happiness is

261
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,249
Just sing.

262
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,463
Light is born, and darkness was born

263
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,715
The two are one

264
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,430
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

265
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:33,061
Hey, can you hear it?

266
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,442
Wow! This is Ino team's battle?!

267
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,652
What a formation based on calculations!

268
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,322
I hate to admit it,
but they're strong!

269
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:49,243
Even the Sound Village ones
would be no match for them!

270
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,496
We'll protect Sasuke...

271
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,499
Huh?! What's this feeling?

272
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,377
Next episode: "Battle Formation:
Ino-Shika-Cho!"

273
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,422
What in the world is going on?!
