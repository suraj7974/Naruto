1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,524
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,211
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,964
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through
life, squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:19,955
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,178
Umm, where's the room that Sasuke's in?

20
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,514
Mr. Sasuke is not allowed any visitors.

21
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,183
What?! Hey, hey! What's up with that?!

22
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,518
I'm sorry, those are the rules.

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,102
Why, Sis, tell me why?

24
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,980
Naruto, this is a hospital. Keep it down.

25
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,567
Say! Say! I've got a favor to ask!

26
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,236
You don't need to say it all.

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,446
Well, I thought it would come to this so...

28
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,991
I searched for
someone to watch your training.

29
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,451
Why?!

30
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,328
I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!

31
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,664
I have some matters to take care of.

32
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,291
I don't have time to
trouble myself with you.

33
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,796
Oh! Aha...!

34
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:12,258
You're going to train Sasuke, aren't you?!

35
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,009
Well... don't say that.

36
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,721
I found a sensei
who's more reliable than I am!

37
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,723
Well...who is it?

38
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,225
It's me!

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,309
Huh?!

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,187
Oh! You!

41
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,439
The Closet Perv!

42
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,774
Such insolence!

43
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:35,197
Ebisu Returns:
Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!

44
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,374
Ebisu Sensei is a Closet Perv?

45
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,336
Why's this guy my training teacher?!

46
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,631
In the first place, he's weaker than me!

47
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,383
What did you say?

48
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,427
But you see! But you see!

49
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,555
A long time ago,
with my Harem Jutsu, this guy...

50
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,973
Transform!

51
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,227
Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!

52
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,193
B-By any chance...

53
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,406
Harem Jutsu?

54
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,284
U-Uh...it's nothing!

55
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,873
I'll treat you to and buy
you whatever you want later!

56
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,167
Just be quiet about that!

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,501
You better.

58
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,714
Wow, I didn't know you were acquainted.

59
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,384
Well, they're unsavory ties, but.

60
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,513
How could I ever forget that humiliation?

61
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,433
But why this guy?

62
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,019
I definitely don't want him to.

63
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,312
Same here.

64
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,191
If it weren't Kakashi's favor,
who'd teach you for the fun of it?

65
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,275
Then don't.

66
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,693
Now now, both of you...

67
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,487
Don't say that.

68
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:04,370
Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
who teaches the elite, a special Jonin!

69
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,748
He's truly better at teaching than I am.

70
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,048
Well, Naruto, of the three
kids in Squad Seven that I taught,

71
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,175
you're the worst at the basic skills.

72
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,303
Get taught with care this time around.

73
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:25,849
How the heck am I inferior
compared to Sakura and Sasuke?!

74
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,190
Naruto, it's fact
that you don't have the fundamentals down.

75
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,360
No matter what you do,
the basic skills are important.

76
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:41,281
If you really want to become strong,
just be quiet and listen to what I say.

77
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,330
Now then, Ebisu Sensei,
I'm leaving him with you.

78
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,540
Yes, yes.

79
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,542
Dang it.

80
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,922
It may appear to be harsh,
but you can become stronger a lot more.

81
00:04:58,716 --> 00:04:59,967
Do your best.

82
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,013
Okay, then, let's go.

83
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,977
Still, I'm not convinced...
Huh?

84
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,354
You see!

85
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,898
Fundamentals might be important,

86
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:19,445
but I won't get strong being
taught by someone weaker than me!

87
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,698
So in other words,
you want to say that I'm weak?

88
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,950
Who else is here?!

89
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:30,247
I was certainly surprised having
that indecent Jutsu used on me that time.

90
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:35,669
But it's premature for
you to judge my ability on just that.

91
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,630
Even though you were totally knocked out.

92
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,176
Fine.

93
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,470
Then, why don't we put it to the test?

94
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,554
Hmm?

95
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,932
Naruto, run.
Huh?

96
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:55,397
If you can get to outrun
me, I'll back down quietly.

97
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,149
Back down...?

98
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,070
Yes. And of course,
I'll speak to Kakashi Sensei

99
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,199
about you receiving direct training.

100
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,742
What?! Really?!

101
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,746
This elite instructor
does not go back on his word.

102
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,333
However, this is
only if you can outrun me.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,503
Then that makes it easy!

104
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,670
See ya!

105
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,974
This'll be a snap, a snap!

106
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,937
I'll lose that... Closet Perv in no time!

107
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,821
He already can't catch up!

108
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,907
I knew I was quite an exceptional Ninja...

109
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,784
Who is exceptional, you say?

110
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:58,293
Surely you're not thinking
you can outrun me with just that much.

111
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,504
W-What're you saying?!

112
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,798
The chase has still...

113
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,843
only just begun!

114
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,029
Though he's a Closet Perv,

115
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,158
he's the elite tutor after all, he's good.

116
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,120
Now then.

117
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,442
I knew you were Closet Perv.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,406
What are you doing...?

119
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,782
Naruto?

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,413
I see. The idea isn't bad.

121
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,542
Then, how about this?!

122
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,753
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

123
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,428
Heh! Catch me...if you can!

124
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,724
Not bad...

125
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:42,689
However, you are not the only
one who uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

126
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,819
I won't let you get away!

127
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,990
Dang it!

128
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,209
Son...of...a...!

129
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,601
Now then, next.

130
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,438
Hold it!

131
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,865
I found you!

132
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,037
Wait!

133
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,291
I won't let you get away!
Get off!

134
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,043
There! No, actually, here! Here!

135
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,879
There! There!

136
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,006
Hold it!

137
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,891
Have you reached your limit?

138
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,775
You're freaking pesky!

139
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,902
Give it up already!

140
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,238
What are you snapping back at me for?

141
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,825
This is a chase,
so chasing is natural, right?

142
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,828
T-True enough...

143
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:24,541
Naruto, you have
understood my greatness by now, right?

144
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,835
It's about time
you surrendered and moved on to training...

145
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,754
The heck with that!

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,136
I'm going to bump you off,
and receive Kakashi Sensei's training!

147
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,222
Even if I have to knock you out!

148
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,226
It appears you still
have some spirit left.

149
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,776
To think he would come at me
head on, even though this is a chase.

150
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,444
Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.

151
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,449
As Kakashi said, he's
the number one unpredictability Ninja.

152
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,409
Don't take this badly! Eat this!

153
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,040
Clone Jutsu...?

154
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,058
The game is over, Naruto!

155
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,977
Dang it!

156
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,902
Miso-flavor barbecued pork
noodles and salt-flavor ramen noodles!

157
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,405
Here you go!

158
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,410
Naruto, having been
shown your movements and

159
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,163
having further analyzed
what Kakashi has told me...

160
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:49,126
it is clear
that you cannot control Chakra well.

161
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,711
Control...?

162
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,130
That's right.

163
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,008
Now then, comparing
you with Sasuke and Sakura ...

164
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,679
I shall explain your bad points in order.

165
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,350
As you know, in the case of
using Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,

166
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,478
Ninjas build up
Chakra and activate the Jutsu.

167
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,565
I-I know that already!

168
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,316
Is that so?

169
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,987
Then, in the case of
comparing the three of you,

170
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,074
I shall explain
specifically how you are inferior.

171
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,035
That's kind of
an irritating way of saying it.

172
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,621
I'm treating you the ramen as promised,

173
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,998
so be quiet and listen!

174
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,295
First, let us say
that Sakura uses Clone Jutsu.

175
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,880
Clone Jutsu!

176
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:43,597
In her case, her build-up control as
well as her control of Chakra is perfect,

177
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,516
so she can make clones
without using wasteful energy.

178
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,727
Cha!

179
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,438
Next, in Sasuke's case,

180
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,691
he is somewhat poor at building up Chakra.

181
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,777
Clone Jutsu.

182
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,202
But, his control of Chakra is perfect,

183
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,706
so both he and
Sakura can make five clones.

184
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:15,295
But, he uses a bit more
wasteful Chakra than Sakura.

185
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,715
Oh! So Sasuke's nothing special.

186
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,761
In your case, there's no
time to be laughing at others.

187
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,845
Huh?

188
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,227
You are very poor at
building up Chakra and controlling it,

189
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,063
so you cannot make clones
with the same amount of Chakra.

190
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,025
In the case where
you strain to make clones despite that,

191
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,947
after consuming a much larger
amount of Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke...

192
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,573
Clone Jutsu!

193
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,745
...you can barely make one clone at best.

194
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:55,585
By the way, Sakura and Sasuke can become
ten with the same amount of Chakra.

195
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:05,762
Like this, the three of you are this
different even using the same Jutsu.

196
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,561
Well, this is a somewhat
exaggerated comparison of you three,

197
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,398
but you build up too much
Chakra, use too much physical strength,

198
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,775
and your Jutsu
activation is also unstable.

199
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,737
But, there've been times when
I was greater than Sakura and Sasuke...

200
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,406
That's only because you happen to have

201
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,451
the most outstanding stamina of the three!

202
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,790
Well, I am pretty sure
that your Chakra control

203
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,127
is getting difficult due to
the influence of the Nine-Tails...

204
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,296
which is the origin of your stamina.

205
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,677
Anyway, there is no
mistaking that you can become strong

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,054
if you carry out
the training we will be doing from now.

207
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,639
Huh?! Really?!

208
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,434
I guarantee it.

209
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,102
Now then, let's go.

210
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,146
Sir, your bill.

211
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,940
Oh, that's right. Wha...?!

212
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,617
Thank you very much!

213
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,003
We've come quite a long way...

214
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,213
But, this is a hot spring town, right?

215
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,051
It doesn't look like we've come
here to leisurely soak in a hot spring...

216
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,221
Hey! Naruto! That's the women's bath!

217
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,850
I simply will not allow indecent behavior!

218
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,811
Huh?

219
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm not you...

220
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,066
It's not that I was
trying to peep. Believe it!

221
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,570
Thinking of something like that in
the first place makes you a Closet Perv!

222
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,991
What's with that look?

223
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,534
N-Nothing.

224
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,996
More importantly,
why've we come to a place like this?!

225
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,499
Will soaking in a hot
spring do anything for training?

226
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,086
No! The training will be
here in this hot spring area!

227
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,425
Okay, this is the place.

228
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,261
It's a bath, sure enough!

229
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,222
What are you saying?

230
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,058
I said this is
training, didn't I? Training!

231
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,769
We're going to train here?

232
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,229
What the heck are we going to do?

233
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,027
Walk on this hot water!

234
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,654
What?!

235
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,740
What is it?

236
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,660
Walk on hot water?

237
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,621
Can you really do that?

238
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,872
Of course!

239
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,085
I heard from Kakashi Sensei.

240
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,089
You already did tree-climbing
training without using your hands, right?

241
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,841
It's an application of that.

242
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,884
Hmm... What do you mean?

243
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,805
Besides, I don't really
remember stuff from long ago!

244
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,558
In tree climbing, all you do is accumulate

245
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,852
only the necessary amount of
Chakra in one necessary location

246
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,896
and maintain
that amount of Chakra all the while.

247
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,650
Trees are fixed objects,
so you only need to be attached to it.

248
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,236
In other words,

249
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,948
it's training for building
up a fixed amount of Chakra.

250
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,159
To float on the surface of water,

251
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,161
you have to discharge on a constant basis

252
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,663
an appropriate amount of
Chakra from your feet to the water

253
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,500
and balance that to the extent
that you can float your own body.

254
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,085
Huh?

255
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,423
This Chakra control is
more difficult than maintaining...

256
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,969
and is a control training for
discharge and usage of fixed amount

257
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,096
of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.

258
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,349
Hmm, I really don't get it!

259
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,811
Well, it would be better
to show you in your case.

260
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,564
First, you build up Chakra in your feet.

261
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,778
Then, while constantly
discharging a fixed amount...

262
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,280
you balance it with your body weight.

263
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,287
And... well, this is how it goes.

264
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,625
Oh! Okay! I'm going to try!

265
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,211
First, you build up Chakra in your feet.

266
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,633
Then! Discharge a fixed amount. Right?

267
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,842
Oh!

268
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:13,885
I knew it.

269
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,845
Hot-hot-hot-hot!

270
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,557
I forgot to mention it,
but this hot water is 60° C.

271
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,810
If you do nothing but fail...

272
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,895
you will become a boiled octopus!

273
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,313
Dang it!

274
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,525
I'll do it no matter what!

275
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,962
You're unusually
spirited today, honored grandson!

276
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,133
My principle of
guidance has finally gotten through!

277
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,011
This would ordinarily
be the time to go carry out

278
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,180
a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.

279
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,225
I've stopped doing that now!

280
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,601
That's right!

281
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,687
So you have finally understood.

282
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,149
That the shortcut to
becoming the Hokage is to do as I say...

283
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,111
There are no shortcuts!

284
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,737
Huh?

285
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,532
Brother Naruto said it...

286
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,912
If you're to become
Hokage, be prepared for that!

287
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,710
Oh!

288
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,714
I'm starting to get it!

289
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,678
To think he would get the hang
of the Chakra control this quickly...

290
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,098
I never thought, you would grow this much.

291
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,436
Indeed, there are no
shortcuts, in anything...

292
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,231
It appears I had the wrong idea about you...

293
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,776
You are a much smarter teacher than I am.

294
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,114
And, you were not just a Demon Fox...

295
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,327
You were a splendid
Hidden Leaf Village Ninja!

296
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,330
Oh! Hot!

297
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,165
Hm?! That is...!

298
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,050
Humph! I don't know
who you are or where you're from, but...

299
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,929
I will not allow indecency!

300
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,348
Man...

301
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,768
T-That is!

302
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,479
What?!

303
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,659
Don't make a ruckus.

304
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,037
Jeez, it won't do to be found out!

305
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,002
The Closet Perv lost?

306
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,466
W-What's with that Shameless Perv?!

307
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,358
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

308
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,736
Two! He kisses and hugs
everyone randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

309
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,156
Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry

310
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,743
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

311
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:32,166
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

312
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,503
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

313
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:40,008
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

314
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,021
One! Bodimahattaya-san
devotes his time for digging black ships

315
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:56,607
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

316
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,069
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

317
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,322
Four! Japanese
people, now lend me your hand!

318
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:09,662
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

319
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,957
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

320
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,961
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

321
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:23,593
All over the world, the sky's
smiling, so look up and smile too

322
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,888
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

323
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,142
Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!

324
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,734
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you!

325
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,320
What're you doing, Shameless Perv?!

326
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,908
Here I was having my training watched,
and you did this to the Closet Perv!

327
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,994
And you're so
infernally quick at running away.

328
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,330
Could he be a super Ninja?

329
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,667
Next episode.
"Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!"

330
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:01,297
I'll chase him down and
make him train me without fail!
