1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,714
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,059
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,687
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:43,878
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"
I wake up

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,174
and someday,

12
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

13
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:08,986
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

16
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

17
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

19
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

20
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,172
One more time

21
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,637
Naruto...!

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,515
He came in totally late.

23
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,939
Hmm? Where's Sasuke?

24
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,608
The Dosu guy I'm supposed
to fight isn't here, either.

25
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,610
Hey, you guys over there.

26
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:55,074
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,388
You guys are the stars
of this "final round"!

28
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,852
Sasuke hasn't been found yet?

29
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,564
A team of several Anbu members
are searching all over,

30
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,190
but they have found nothing.

31
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,653
He might already be in
the hands of Orochimaru...

32
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,448
If that's the case,
we may never find him.

33
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,370
I understand.

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,627
Well-well... Lord Kazekage.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,563
You must be tired having
come all this way.

36
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,025
No...I'm glad the arena
is in the Leaf Village.

37
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:16,196
Even though you're still young, it would
probably be a tough journey for you

38
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,491
if you had to go to the trouble
of traveling someplace else.

39
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,121
Shouldn't you decide on
the Fifth Hokage soon?

40
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,213
Please don't treat me
like an old person.

41
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,884
I'm still planning on
being Hokage for another five years...

42
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,063
Now then, I guess it's
about time to begin.

43
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:59,657
Everyone, thank you very much
for coming

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,745
to the Village Hidden in Leaves
Chunin Exam.

45
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,374
We will now begin the
"final round" matches

46
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,503
for the eight who made it
through the preliminaries!

47
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,839
Please watch until the end!

48
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,137
If there are supposed to be eight,
it looks like there's one missing.

49
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,855
I have something to tell
you before the match.

50
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,651
Look at this.

51
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,860
Huh?!

52
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,450
There was a slight change
to the tournament.

53
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,163
Check who you'll be facing
one more time.

54
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,002
Here, I had more preliminary
matches than the others...

55
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,880
So the Dosu guy dropped out?

56
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,680
I thought I'd pound you here...

57
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,018
If I did that,
there'd be the possibility for me,

58
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,063
as the one remaining after
the first battle, to fight Sasuke.

59
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,361
W-What are you?!

60
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,119
Say...

61
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,662
...say.

62
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,164
What?

63
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,542
Umm...Sasuke still hasn't come.

64
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,085
What'll happen?

65
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,343
I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out
of the hospital room at that time.

66
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,477
Something could've happened to him...

67
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,565
In case a competitor does not arrive
by the start time of his match...

68
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,527
he or she will lose by default!

69
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,823
It doesn't make sense.

70
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:09,161
Knowing his character,
he'd come even if he had to drag himself.

71
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,881
Where are you going, Gaara?

72
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,760
To verify my existence...
one more time.

73
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,987
One more time.

74
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,366
What's wrong?
You should still be able to move, right?!

75
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,664
Sasuke! Come on!

76
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,677
Could it be...?

77
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,638
Even after I warned him to avoid
doing anything to stand out...

78
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,768
He didn't kill that Sasuke Uchiha
also, did he...?

79
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,273
Listen up, you guys.

80
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,943
The terrain is different,
but the rule is that there are no rules,

81
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,862
the same as
in the preliminaries.

82
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:30,033
The matches will continue until one
or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.

83
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:38,208
However, if I judge that it has been settled,
I'll stop the match there.

84
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,419
Arguments will not be allowed.

85
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,713
Understood?

86
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,092
So the first match is...

87
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,803
Naruto Uzumaki.

88
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,849
Neji Hyuga.

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,353
Just those two remain and
the rest of you go to the waiting room.

90
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,781
Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!

91
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,333
Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.

92
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,171
Uh-huh.

93
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,132
This match will be quite interesting!

94
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,386
Naruto...

95
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,931
Say, Sakura.

96
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,602
I understand that you're worried
about Sasuke.

97
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,189
But why don't you cheer
for Naruto at least a little bit?

98
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,693
Hmm. You're right.

99
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,028
That being said,

100
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,156
with Neji as his opponent,
Naruto has no chance of winning.

101
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,783
That is...!

102
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,368
Not so, is what you're
going to say?

103
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,542
But to think that brat would
survive until this point...

104
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,088
I wonder if this is
as far as it goes

105
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,839
for those who survived
just by luck, after all.

106
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,967
That Naruto.

107
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,387
This is not a good opponent at all.

108
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,807
No matter how you look at it,
he can't beat the Hyuga clan.

109
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,522
Well, that's what I thought
at the beginning...

110
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,110
But you'll all be surprised
if you underestimate him.

111
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,239
Akamaru, what's wrong?

112
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,367
What did you say?!

113
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,038
What?! Where?!

114
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,461
There!

115
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,967
What's Anbu, the Black Ops,
doing here?

116
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,636
Is something going on...?

117
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,398
You seem like you want
to say something.

118
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,829
I said it before, too, didn't I?

119
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:27,169
A failure is a failure.
You can't change.

120
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,507
I promise ...

121
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,311
I'll win, no matter what!

122
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,611
He has the look...
of being sure of himself...

123
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,780
It's as if he's not all worked up...

124
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,160
That makes it
more worthwhile for me.

125
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,163
I look forward to your look
of disappointment...

126
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,585
when you know the true reality...

127
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,837
Stop whining.

128
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,262
Let's...get started!

129
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,062
Now then, round one.

130
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,855
Begin!

131
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,378
Watch carefully, Hanabi.

132
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,592
Nobody has inherited such
a strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.

133
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,761
To say nothing of your older sister.

134
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,097
More than big sister?

135
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,975
Perhaps more than you, too.

136
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,483
This time, it's not an opponent
that can be managed easily.

137
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,360
He has that Byakugan.

138
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,039
Close combat is no good...

139
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,751
Does Naruto know that?

140
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,206
Idiot! Why would anyone
attack from the front?!

141
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,229
No! Naruto.

142
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,940
The opponent can see
your Chakra Points!

143
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,028
They're called Chakra Points.

144
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,071
If those pressure points
are pressed accurately...

145
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,824
the flow of an opponent's Chakra
can be stopped,

146
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:13,288
amplified or controlled at will.

147
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,375
Uh-oh!

148
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,677
I missed, huh...?

149
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,183
In other words, he'll press
the pressure point if I get too close

150
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,934
and I'll become unable
to use Jutsu.

151
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,480
That means all I can do
is fight from a distance.

152
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,443
You understand, right?
You have no way of winning.

153
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,449
Heh... All I did was to verify your power.

154
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,337
The real fight is just getting started!

155
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,427
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

156
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,392
You used your head,
didn't you, Naruto?!

157
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,352
With the Shadow Clone Jutsu...

158
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,605
Heh. He's an interesting kid.

159
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,983
Shadow Clone Jutsu is
a Jonin level technique.

160
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,404
To think he could use
such an Jutsu...

161
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,907
Who knows how this'll turn out?

162
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,205
Shadow Clone Jutsu?!

163
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:42,711
I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed
among the clones,

164
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,382
indeed, I can't detect the
real one even with my Byakugan.

165
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,178
But there's only one real one,
after all!

166
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,057
Heh. Don't be acting tough!

167
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,810
If you're going to come,
then come.

168
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,857
It's pointless.

169
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:10,029
In front of that Neji's defense,
it's not just all attacking.

170
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,783
Hey!

171
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,037
Don't...you...underestimate...

172
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,497
...me!

173
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,709
Here they come!

174
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,601
He hit!

175
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,856
Fool.

176
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,070
Wha...?!

177
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,532
Dang it!

178
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,784
I'll get you next time!

179
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,790
Here!

180
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,677
This guy...

181
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,707
Does he have eyes behind him...?

182
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,804
You're going to become...
the Hokage...?

183
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,808
With this level, it's impossible.

184
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,773
I can generally tell
with these eyes...

185
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,402
Intrinsic abilities are set.

186
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:18,157
Figuratively speaking,
everything inherent about people is set.

187
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,496
Why...?

188
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:30,587
Why are you always so
judgmental like that?

189
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,382
Then...are you going to say
that anybody can become the Hokage...

190
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,884
if they just work hard?

191
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:43,224
Only a very small percentage of
Shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!

192
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,810
Look more at reality!

193
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,440
Those who become the Hokage
are born with a destiny.

194
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,693
It's not something you become
by trying to become it.

195
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,529
It's determined by destiny.

196
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,242
People must live within
their different respective currents

197
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,328
that can't be defied.

198
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:13,046
The one single...
destiny everyone has equally...

199
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,389
...is death.

200
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,940
Those eyes...

201
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,234
He still holds a grudge
against the head family, huh?

202
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,032
So...

203
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,661
So what?!

204
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:57,548
I don't know when to give up!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

205
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,942
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

206
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,362
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

207
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,824
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

208
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,743
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

209
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:32,208
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

210
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:39,298
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

211
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,563
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

212
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,858
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

213
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,319
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

214
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,573
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

215
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:09,871
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

216
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:16,961
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

217
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:23,551
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

218
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:30,641
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

219
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,735
Darn it! What is going on?!

220
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,489
It was clear that my punch got him,
but I'm the one who was thrown!

221
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,034
Darn it!
Even though I promised Hinata...

222
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,703
I really cannot lose at
a place like this!

223
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,122
The next hit will be the big one
that I'm gonna give him!

224
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,957
Just prepare for it!

225
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,045
Next time, "Ultimate Defense:
Zero Blind Spot!"

226
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,964
I hardly give up things!
