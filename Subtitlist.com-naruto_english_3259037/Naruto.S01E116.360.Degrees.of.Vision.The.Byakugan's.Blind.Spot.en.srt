1
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:19,895
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,024
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,571
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:34,243
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,622
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:44,879
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:51,969
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,807
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,728
Leaving nothing behind,

10
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,356
let us share what is left

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,113
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

12
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:18,078
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

13
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:24,418
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

14
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:27,463
and melting away

15
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:38,682
Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

16
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,143
Uh-oh!

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,523
8 Trigrams 2 Palms!

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,153
4 Palms!

19
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,989
8 Palms!

20
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,075
16 Palms!

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,327
32 Palms!

22
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,331
64 Palms!

23
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,646
What's going on?!

24
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,122
A golden body surface...?

25
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,567
It's the same material as the weapon
he spit out of his mouth earlier...

26
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,279
That was close.

27
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,032
I hear that if you're hit straight on
with Gentle Fist,

28
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,366
your Chakra Network gets damaged

29
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,036
and you become unable
to build up Chakra...

30
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,370
That was close.

31
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,249
Are you a monster?

32
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,127
It seems to come
not just from your mouth.

33
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,006
Gum Style Spider Thread...

34
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,010
is a metal that hardens
the instant it leaves my body.

35
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,096
Moreover, it doesn't let Chakra through.

36
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,973
And...

37
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:46,727
it can be secreted
not just from my mouth,

38
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,772
but also from the sweat glands
throughout my body.

39
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,617
Attacks on Chakra points won't work.

40
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,495
Now it makes sense...

41
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,838
The Spider Web Net won't work.

42
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,467
And there'll be no close-range combat
fighting ̀against a Gentle Fist opponent.

43
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,927
In other words,

44
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,846
I just have to attack the blind side
from long distance.

45
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,900
There'll be no sound...
It'll be in a flash.

46
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,452
The game's over.

47
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,665
The Kunai Knife is a fake!

48
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,715
What?!

49
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,341
8 Trigrams Palm...

50
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,469
Rotation!

51
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,355
Wha–?! What is that?!

52
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,202
Does he...have eyes behind him?!

53
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,955
And the defense just now...

54
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,542
He repelled physical attacks
with Chakra?!

55
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:23,008
360 Degrees of Vision:
The Byakugan's Blind Spot!

56
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,313
If we're not prepared for
"one person, one kill,"

57
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,232
then it's not going to work out...

58
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,276
That's what you said earlier.

59
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,199
Hurry up and go!
I'll catch up with you all!

60
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,082
We have to be prepared for
"one person, one kill."

61
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,209
Naruto...

62
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,587
You've got better eyes than me.

63
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,425
Neji...

64
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,886
Catch up with us, no matter what!

65
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,527
Can he see me?!

66
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,489
What the heck is he?!

67
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,451
I know you're there.

68
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,121
Come out.

69
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,081
Those eyes...

70
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,668
It seems they can do more
than just see through the Chakra flow...

71
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,006
So I see there was
an extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.

72
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,551
A long range battle
is unfavorable...

73
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,013
I must bring this to
close combat by all means.

74
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,056
Very well.

75
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:03,609
I'll acknowledge that this game has
a somewhat high level of difficulty!

76
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,862
I too shall go for it seriously...

77
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,285
It's like he's a totally different person
from before...

78
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,246
His Chakra activity is overwhelming.

79
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,958
And those markings...

80
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,134
His move earlier...

81
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,553
He dodged an attack aimed
from behind

82
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,139
and was able to see me hiding
in the shadows.

83
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,601
In other words,

84
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,479
he has a combined wide range
of sight and X-ray vision.

85
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,857
And what's more, that Jutsu...

86
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,651
If so...

87
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,615
Summoning Jutsu!

88
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,250
Your ability...

89
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,796
I'll find a way to impeccably assault it.

90
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,181
If he defends
against physical attacks

91
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,726
with a large emission
of Chakra and its Rotation...

92
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,438
all I need to do then is to stop
that Chakra Rotation!

93
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,858
Scatter!

94
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:38,829
Rotation!

95
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,299
It's starting to stop.

96
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,599
Here!

97
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,111
Die!

98
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,877
He released the Chakra just in time
and repelled the Kunai Knife!

99
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,341
To think he'd stop my Chakra Rotation

100
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,384
by binding it with Chakra threads...

101
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,595
These things...

102
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,306
I just have to cut them for now.

103
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,602
If the Rotation won't do,

104
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,562
then I just have to dodge
each and every one.

105
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,525
This guy uses
close-range Taijutsu-style combat .

106
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,778
There will be no problem
if I fight him from afar.

107
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,867
In that way...
I'll have a good long look at your ability.

108
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,441
8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!

109
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,992
What a number!

110
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,724
Hm?! His stance changed?!

111
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,185
8 Trigrams.

112
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,271
128 Palms!

113
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,412
He's fast!
The number of strikes has doubled...!

114
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,498
If I get nailed by that straight on,
it'll be the end for me.

115
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,293
If that's the case on his end,

116
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,712
then it'll be a battle of numbers
on this end, too!

117
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,108
The number's too great!
I won't have enough time!

118
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,283
The Rotation's no good,
just as I thought...

119
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,091
It seems he has 360-degree vision.

120
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,719
And it seems he deals
with enemy attacks

121
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,556
by combining his X-ray vision ability
for seeing through things

122
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,684
and his telescopic vision ability
for long-distance sight.

123
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,857
Furthermore, although
he's got 360-degree vision,

124
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,443
that vision has a formidable extent...

125
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,448
If I were to determine the range
from his reaction before...

126
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,992
he almost unfailingly detected
the Kunai Knives

127
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:51,790
that entered the approximately
150-foot circumference around him.

128
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,002
But for some reason,

129
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,129
there are Kunai Knives
he can't evade completely.

130
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,258
If so...

131
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,141
8 Trigrams, Sixty...

132
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,149
I see...

133
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,665
This time, there'll be even more.

134
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,175
This time, two will hit...

135
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,116
I've found a way to impeccably
assault your ability!

136
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,536
It seems that defense technique

137
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,081
was something to compensate
for this weak point!

138
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,500
In other words...

139
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,212
Your Visual Jutsu isn't perfect!

140
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:36,978
Why even bother?!
I've won the game!

141
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:51,201
Come on. Are you going to
keep at it for naught?

142
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:56,623
The fate of the small fry character in an
easy game is to be destroyed right away!

143
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,711
You can't beat me!

144
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,637
– I-I'm not done yet.
– Lee...

145
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,432
You never give up do you?

146
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:18,061
No way you can beat him.

147
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,021
He's a genius unlike you.

148
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,650
Genius? What is genius anyway!

149
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,779
Even without any talent,
I'll surpass "genius" by working hard.

150
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,656
It's no use, Lee.

151
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,328
No matter how hard you work,
you cannot beat me.

152
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,831
It's already decided.

153
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,499
Lady Hinata...

154
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,210
You're the sheltered little baby
of the main branch.

155
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,463
A person can never change.

156
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,050
And then, this match...

157
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:54,514
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.

158
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:01,020
You don't know until you try!

159
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,026
This is the end...

160
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,098
Gentle Fist!

161
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:51,237
Small fry character one...
Destruction completed.

162
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,721
Well, for a crummy game,
I was entertained...

163
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,690
Heh... I missed the fatal spots, huh?

164
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:14,529
And he wouldn't easily die from
Kunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?

165
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,286
I see...
He's still going to entertain me, huh?

166
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,539
This is thanks for that.

167
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,806
Seriously, that fat Jirobo
can't be helped,

168
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,350
but what's that clod Kidomaru
doing anyway...?

169
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,144
That lowlife!

170
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,856
He's got the habit of playing games.

171
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,692
Maybe he's found someone
to entertain him?

172
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,485
When that idiot plays too much,

173
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:58,531
he becomes hyper
and easily gets into that state...

174
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,996
But still...
Once he gets to the second state...

175
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,040
it's instant death for the opponent.

176
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,574
Maximum destructive power...

177
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:48,122
with 100% accuracy!

178
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,802
Die!

179
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,481
For the first time, I spoke to you

180
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,401
And you smiled

181
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,945
For the first time, I was able to speak

182
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,489
In my own words

183
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:27,286
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

184
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,875
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

185
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:38,715
My clumsy attempts with words

186
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,470
You listened without turning away

187
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:50,768
No wonder I get carried away by you

188
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:57,817
But you don't feel anything for me, do you?

189
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,611
I feel so sad

190
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,407
But... For the first time, I spoke to you

191
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,993
And you smiled

192
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,079
For the first time, I was able to speak

193
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,665
In my own words

194
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,710
For the first time, I spoke to you

195
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,379
And you smiled

196
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,466
For the first time, I was able to speak

197
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,010
In my own words

198
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:29,015
For the first time, I spoke to you

199
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,566
He doesn't carry out wasteful attacks.

200
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,236
And he accurately reads
information from the results.

201
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,532
No mistake, this guy's the strongest
of all I've fought up until now!

202
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,452
I probably won't be able
to evade the next attack.

203
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,831
I've had enough.
I can't dodge it anyway.

204
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:58,628
Since the secret of my eyes
has been discovered, I won't run or hide!

205
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,631
