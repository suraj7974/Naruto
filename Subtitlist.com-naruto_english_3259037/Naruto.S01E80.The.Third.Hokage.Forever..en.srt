1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,887
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,602
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,609
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,319
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,627
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:50,718
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,065
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,652
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,156
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

16
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,701
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,246
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,375
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,630
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,637
The Third Hokage, Forever...

21
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,360
Sarutobi...

22
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,738
At the very least this sword...

23
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,537
It was a fitting end for somebody like you

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,957
who has mastered
the Way of the Shinobi.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,299
It feels like my arms are burning...

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,968
Master Orochimaru!

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,387
This is where we call off our plan.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,516
Release the Barrier.
We'll head back.

29
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,726
Yes!
Release!

30
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,940
The Barrier...!

31
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,108
It's released!

32
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,901
Where is Lord Hokage?

33
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,033
Let's go!

34
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,494
We won't let you get away!

35
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,959
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!

36
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,715
An adhesive type of string
filled with Chakra...?

37
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,803
Kakashi! They're on the move!
Do we go after them?

38
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,305
No, wait, Guy.

39
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,389
That's right...

40
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,019
If you make a move without
any data on the situation up there,

41
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,021
you will get caught in
the enemy's trap.

42
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,815
I'm totally aware of that.

43
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,483
But regardless of whether
there is a trap or not,

44
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,944
we can't let the enemy get away
at a time like this!

45
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,155
That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!

46
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,284
So...are you just going to watch?

47
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,744
Kabuto?

48
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,874
So you did know, after all.

49
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,043
So...what are we going to do?

50
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,669
It's about time that
we made a retreat.

51
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,880
You're going to run away
from me again?

52
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,799
Right now...

53
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,887
if we show our cards,
they're most likely going to be copied.

54
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,389
Then again,

55
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:47,311
it doesn't seem like you've completely
mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.

56
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,029
Well then...

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,291
Temari...

58
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,548
Kankuro!

59
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,951
I'm leaving Sakura with you.

60
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,413
H-Hey!

61
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,181
Why is...this guy so strong?

62
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,477
My existence will not disappear...

63
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,857
I will not disappear!
I cannot disappear!

64
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,423
I told you not to talk to that guy!

65
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,966
Let's go.

66
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,640
Oh, there! That's him...

67
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,144
Go away!

68
00:05:54,688 --> 00:06:00,694
Monster! Monster! Monster...!

69
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,331
You monster! Die!

70
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,087
That's him... Don't get involved, fool!

71
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,591
Don't look at him!

72
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,887
Go away!

73
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,790
To them, I'm just a relic of the past
who they want to see disappear.

74
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:59,711
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

75
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:07,886
And that time, I thought of myself that I...
no, that is what I had to think.

76
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,474
And then knew that
it was the most painful thing.

77
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:19,898
That I... that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.

78
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,818
D-Don't come any closer!

79
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:37,541
The pain of...being all alone...
really is unbearable, isn't it?

80
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,005
The way you feel...

81
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,675
I don't know why,
but I completely understand that it hurts.

82
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:52,681
But I've met people who are
very important to me now.

83
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,772
I won't allow those important people...
to get hurt!

84
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:08,697
If not, I will stop you even if
that means...that I have to kill you!

85
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,407
Why...?

86
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,786
How is it that you can fight so much
for other people?

87
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,958
They saved me from the hell
of being all alone.

88
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,461
They accepted me for who I was.

89
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,424
That's why...they are important to me!

90
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:39,186
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

91
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,813
to love and watch over that person...

92
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,900
Love...

93
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,321
That is why he is so strong?

94
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,283
That's enough, Naruto...

95
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,081
Sakura is okay.

96
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,668
This guy's Chakra must
have been depleted as well...

97
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,004
Sakura's sand crumbled
a long time ago.

98
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,632
Oh, I see...

99
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,850
I've had enough... Stop here.

100
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:19,935
Gaara?

101
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,986
I've never seen Gaara in such
a weakened state before...

102
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,655
All right.

103
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,316
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

104
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,321
One of these days, even I...

105
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,327
Temari... Kankuro...

106
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,411
– Huh?
– Huh?

107
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,079
Sorry...

108
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,878
D-Don't worry about it...

109
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,661
Rain...

110
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,330
The sky has started to weep as well...

111
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,585
We will begin the memorial service

112
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,546
for the Third Hokage,
who lost his life in this battle,

113
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,884
as well as the other victims
of this battle.

114
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,137
It's started...

115
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,558
In the end,
all we could do was just watch...

116
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,120
Why?

117
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,083
Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?

118
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,135
Why...?

119
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,322
It's already been a year...

120
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:47,827
It's not easy to laugh
hiding your sadness.

121
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:54,209
I heard from your teacher that
you're the center of laughter...

122
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,503
I'm not sad at all!

123
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,339
It's a very honorable thing for
a Shinobi to die doing their duty!

124
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,550
My dad and mom sacrificed their lives

125
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,761
to protect this village
from the Demon Fox...

126
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,304
They're heroes!

127
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:12,102
I am the child of the heroes!
I'm not sad to be alone.

128
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,855
And besides, these are tears of joy.

129
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,148
It's all right.

130
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:25,240
I know that you're curled up
holding your knees by yourself.

131
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,661
But you're not alone...

132
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,745
Huh?

133
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:36,793
The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village
have the will of fire...

134
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,461
Will of fire...?

135
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,465
It's the strong will to protect
the Leaf Village.

136
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:50,223
As long as they have this will of fire,
everybody in this village are all family.

137
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,519
Iruka... I wonder if you have it?

138
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,150
Yeah...

139
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,548
For Hayate...?

140
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,016
The Third Hokage's funeral
has already started. Make it quick.

141
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,312
You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito...?

142
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,358
If you're always thinking of
an excuse for your tardiness,

143
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,569
you should just come earlier.

144
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,659
I do...from early in the morning.

145
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,747
It's just that,
whenever I come here

146
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,293
I just want to punish myself
for being such a fool in the past.

147
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,425
Humph...

148
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,622
Shinobi, no matter what kind
of situation they are in,

149
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,542
cannot show their emotion.

150
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,961
You must always prioritize your mission,

151
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,464
and never shed a tear in
any kind of situation...

152
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,067
Iruka Sensei...

153
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,194
Hmm?

154
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,949
Why do people risk their own lives
for other people?

155
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,915
When one person dies...

156
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,879
their past, their present life, and their future
disappear along with them.

157
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,674
Many people die doing their duty
and fighting in battle...

158
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,845
And shockingly easily, too.

159
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,099
Hayate was one of them.

160
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,312
Those who pass away also
have dreams and ambitions.

161
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:29,734
But everyone has something else,
just as important.

162
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:37,826
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers...
Those who are dear to them.

163
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,454
They trust each other and help each other,

164
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:46,209
the people whom they've cherished
since the day they were born.

165
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,463
And that string which connects
those people

166
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:54,175
becomes stronger and
thicker as time goes by...

167
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,136
It can't be explained by logic...

168
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:03,685
Those who hold those strings just do it,
because it's important to them.

169
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,565
Yeah, I kind of get it.

170
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,150
But...

171
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,154
It's tough to die.

172
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,075
It's not like he just died for nothing.

173
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,704
He left us something very important.

174
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,792
Well, you'll eventually understand
one of these days.

175
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,254
Yeah, I kind of get that too!

176
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,594
The rain's stopped.

177
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,606
Bye! Iruka Sensei!

178
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,149
Yeah...

179
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,238
Lord Third Hokage,
the will of fire you spoke of

180
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:02,118
seems to have been passed on
to the young Leaves.

181
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,498
The flame in their hearts
which you lit

182
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:11,169
will burn bright and strong...

183
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:15,465
And it will shine upon this village,
and watch over and protect us.

184
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,516
It will become a new Hokage...
one of these days...

185
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,527
They did manage to avoid annihilation,

186
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,863
but it seems the damage
is pretty extensive.

187
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,367
The village that was once
at the height of its glory...

188
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,202
How sad...

189
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,040
How unlike you.

190
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,168
You have lingering affections
for your old home?

191
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,212
Even you?

192
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,465
No, not at all.

193
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,189
A cycle of hardship, right?

194
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,361
Inside, we were crying, right?

195
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:24,826
But the one thing we won't give up

196
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

197
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,540
It's a secondary role,

198
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,295
a role in the shadows

199
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

200
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:47,557
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

201
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,353
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

202
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:57,608
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

203
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,738
Over and over,

204
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,160
we believed and dreamed

205
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,498
Over and over,
we've seen fools

206
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:18,254
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

207
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,761
Now, it's our turn...

208
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:29,974
Let us bask in our dreams

209
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,026
The ritual ends, and morning mist
will be covering all soon.

210
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:41,986
Silence...

211
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,532
In that white mist,
the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.

212
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:54,290
It awakens childhood memory,
disappointment, ire, and resolve.

213
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:00,755
The cog wheel named destiny
slowly begins to turn...

214
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,634
Next time: "Return of the Morning Mist"
