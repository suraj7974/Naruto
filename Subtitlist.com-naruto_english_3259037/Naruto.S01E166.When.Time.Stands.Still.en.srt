1
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and
gather the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,279
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long
way to go on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards
the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,458
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,717
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,320
There was something beyond
that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,159
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,331
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,183
As long as the score isn't settled,

16
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,229
the clock inside my heart will
remain stopped in the past!

17
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,442
Lord Sagi, if you live
for revenge,

18
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,861
your heart will sink
into darkness!

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,739
If it means that I am able
to carry out my revenge...

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,576
I don't care if my heart sinks
into darkness!

21
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,295
That's exactly right.

22
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,924
I hold a grudge against you,
I hate you...

23
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,303
My only purpose in living
has been to kill you...

24
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,472
Sasuke!
I've...

25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,100
I've survived!

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,021
I'm finished with messing around
with you Leaf Village guys.

27
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,067
I will go to Orochimaru!

28
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,655
I can't...let you go there...

29
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,616
I cannot allow...!

30
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,493
you to go there!

31
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,835
I wasn't able to stop a comrade
who was sinking into darkness...

32
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,796
However, I won't let you go there,
no matter what!

33
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,007
You pesky little...

34
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,509
If you get in my way,
I'll consider you an enemy too!

35
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,888
There's no way you guys...
could ever understand!

36
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,810
It's a trick device!

37
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,193
No one can hinder my desire!

38
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,034
What was that?!

39
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,705
It's no good!
We can't get out!

40
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,734
Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves!

41
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,237
Lightning Blade!

42
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,000
There!

43
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,971
How did you figure it out...?!

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,145
Because I've seen your Jutsu
with these very eyes...

45
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,941
I remember now...
You are...

46
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,902
Hatake...Kakashi...

47
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,239
The Copy Ninja with
the Sharingan...

48
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,951
Your Jutsu doesn't even faintly mirror
that of Gaara's...

49
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,829
You've only scratched its surface...

50
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,332
All you're doing is leaving
your main body elsewhere

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,961
and using your Chakra to manipulate
the rocks and sand...

52
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,296
We are nomads...

53
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,843
ridiculed as lower-ranked Shinobi
without a village...

54
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:07,141
That's why we travel around the country,
stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,

55
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,602
struggling to one day find our way
into a place in the sun.

56
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,356
But no matter how dedicated
our efforts are...

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,402
to think there are dimensions
that cannot be transgressed...

58
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,881
That's the direction of
the Feudal Lord's palace...

59
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,268
Hurry up! Lord Sagi's thought
to be buried beneath there!

60
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,237
Damn it!
We really got screwed...

61
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,407
That jerk!

62
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,078
What a jerk... Gimme a break!

63
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,954
What happened...

64
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,540
Kakashi Sensei!

65
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,796
Sagi totally squashed us just now
and went off somewhere!

66
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,964
Gimme a break...
that guy's some kind of jerk!

67
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,383
Please don't blame him for
the things he has done.

68
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,885
But...!

69
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,889
He is himself,
but not himself right now.

70
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,266
Huh? What do you mean?

71
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,060
He is obsessed with avenging

72
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,437
his father and
younger sister's deaths.

73
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:41,902
I believe he is possessed
by the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.

74
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,823
Oh come on... Stop joking...

75
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,867
That's not necessarily a joke.

76
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:53,622
Stop it! That kind of thing gives me
the creeps!

77
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,543
Get a grip! This isn't the time to be
squabbling over things like that!

78
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,503
What's important right now
is to find Sagi!

79
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,173
But we have no idea
where he went.

80
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,134
If he is possessed,

81
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,344
it is certain that
he will return to take revenge...

82
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,430
And moreover...very soon...

83
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,048
Elder Brother...

84
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,595
If I were to lose you too,
after having lost our father...

85
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,140
I could not go on living...

86
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,533
Father...Elder Brother...

87
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,494
I shall join with you...

88
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,973
Elder Brother!

89
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,373
Elder Brother...
I will avenge this without fail...

90
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,334
I will once more restart
the hands of time for you, Elder Brother,

91
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,794
whose time was brought to a standstill...

92
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,571
Until the day that wish is realized...

93
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,660
I will live as you, Elder Brother,
as Sagi!

94
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:35,427
Sagi's temperament is such that
he will undoubtedly come here for Moso.

95
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,175
It's actually quite convenient

96
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,928
that Lord Sagi comes
all the way here to see me...

97
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,431
Even if I can't get my hands
on Sagi, the Feudal Lord,

98
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,518
it's not a crime to kill him
as the Cursed Warrior.

99
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,439
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

100
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:39,408
What a joke... A ghost appearing
in a child's toy...

101
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,649
You have some nerve appearing here
like this...

102
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,025
Cursed Warrior...

103
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,364
Lord Sagi...

104
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,200
Huh...who are you...?

105
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,744
Aren't you the high and mighty Moso?

106
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,123
I won't answer to words like that
from the likes of a ghost.

107
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,584
Damn you!

108
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,389
That's right...

109
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,268
Moso is just a fictitious name
used to deceive the world...

110
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,312
My name is Hoki...

111
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,772
The Leader who heads
the Wandering Ninja...

112
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,240
In place of not having a village,
we the Wandering Ninja

113
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:05,660
steal Jutsu from every village
we pass through and make them our own!

114
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,876
But our family has tired of living
for so long as nomads.

115
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,340
And we have been searching
for a Land to call our home.

116
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,383
I see...

117
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,468
From the very start,

118
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,303
you came here to the Land of Bird
with the intention of taking it over!

119
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,430
There's no way that
somebody like you,

120
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,307
who was born destined to become
a feudal lord...

121
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,018
could understand
the suffering of Wandering Ninja

122
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,521
who do not have a homeland!

123
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,690
I don't see a problem...

124
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,985
with the Wandering Ninja
seeking a safe homeland.

125
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,823
After all, your father was someone
who easily trusted others...

126
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,620
He never even suspected anything
when I switched with the monk Moso,

127
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,332
highly reputed for his virtue,
and neared him...

128
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,776
He misinterpreted
my Genjutsu of deception

129
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,321
as being the holy power
of the virtuous Moso

130
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,408
and put me on the fast track...

131
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,579
The only person who suspected me
was Komei.

132
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,084
I assassinated Owashi
and drove Komei away...

133
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,046
Y-You jerk...
so it was you, after all!

134
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,716
And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.

135
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,052
If I can do that, I will have accomplished
what I set out to do!

136
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,263
You jerk! I won't forgive you!

137
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,265
Revenge for my clan!

138
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,028
You are...?!

139
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,448
Yes, that's right!

140
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,367
My name is Toki!

141
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,703
Lady Toki...!

142
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,123
I will avenge my father
and brother's death!

143
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,083
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

144
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,923
Look at that, Toki...
Our shadows are overlapping, right...

145
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,508
That's the Shadow Possession Jutsu!

146
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,011
With this, you won't be able
to move anymore!

147
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,974
But I wouldn't have imagined that
you would be the younger sister Toki...

148
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:41,399
The Wandering Ninja will be successful
in taking control of this land.

149
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,861
You will die as Sagi just
as you desire!

150
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,283
Lady Toki! Keep your composure!

151
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,077
Chishima...

152
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,582
So you were alive, huh...

153
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,335
I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.

154
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,545
Chishima is most ashamed!

155
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,714
Take this and die!

156
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,929
I overheard everything just now.

157
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,599
Sagi, I mean, Toki!
Leave the rest to me!

158
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,934
Naruto...?!

159
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,437
That's not gonna happen!
You will die by your own shadow!

160
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,940
The shadow has nothing to do with it!

161
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,151
You're just under the influence
of his Genjutsu!

162
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,072
What?!

163
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,326
Lady Toki...

164
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,413
Shadow Possession is
Shikamaru's Clan's Secret Jutsu!

165
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,499
There's no way you could
even hope to imitate it!

166
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,420
Not only is your identity fake,
but your Ninjutsu is too!

167
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,963
Who the hell are you?!

168
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:49,968
Naruto!

169
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,513
The heavens are watching your villainy!

170
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,182
There is no way we will forgive you!

171
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,603
Why you Leaf Ninja...
But it's only a Clone Jutsu!

172
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,106
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

173
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,821
They have substances?!

174
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,740
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

175
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,993
Sasuke's Phoenix Flower Jutsu
is much more awesome!

176
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,495
It's my turn this time!

177
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,122
Damn you!

178
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,802
Kakashi Hatake...

179
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,345
So you're here too, huh...

180
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,016
Hoki, the leader who heads
the Wandering Shinobi...huh...

181
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,809
I've heard rumors about you...

182
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,315
So you're a Shinobi who wanders
from place to place like a bat...

183
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:51,571
Ninja from a rich village can't possibly
imagine circumstances like ours...

184
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,740
Like hell I'll understand it...

185
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,785
The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninja
is to become a Ninja who can endure...

186
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:02,081
People like you who trick people
and wishfully try to seize land

187
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,042
have no right to call themselves Shinobi!

188
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,503
Elitist!

189
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,088
Summoning Jutsu!

190
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,144
Damn! That's a real dragon!

191
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,480
No way!

192
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,201
Wait...!

193
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,119
Wait!

194
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,918
Over there, huh...

195
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,262
What's up with that?

196
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,271
So the Summoning Dragons
were fake too ...

197
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,690
He fled off somewhere...

198
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,653
Inside the mansion!
I'm not letting him get away!

199
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,917
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

200
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,054
Hey you...wait!

201
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,977
Where did he vanish to?!

202
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,939
Hey, Leaf Ninja...

203
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,858
Huh?!

204
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,824
Wh-What?!

205
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,328
If you want to have Toki back,
come over here...

206
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,330
H-How?!

207
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,046
Take that boat to come over here...

208
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,213
Genjutsu?

209
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,759
Are you scared,
you Leaf apprentice Ninja?

210
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,262
I'm not an apprentice!

211
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,692
This place...don't tell me it's...

212
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,616
What's that?

213
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,197
The wind blows, Ah...

214
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,659
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

215
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,537
What should be brought along?

216
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,165
Assemble them into a piece.

217
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,378
There is no second chance, never

218
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,380
How foolish it is to throw away

219
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,299
Acting so innocently, Ah...

220
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,343
The images.

221
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,100
It probably will not end

222
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,939
It probably will not end

223
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,111
Burn that love-filled heart,

224
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,364
Sail across a thousand dreams

225
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,242
Running freely

226
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,829
To take hold of the world in hand

227
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,041
The clouds scatter

228
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,127
The sun sets yet again

229
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,925
The solo parade begins to move.

230
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,345
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

231
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,766
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

232
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,775
Chishima...

233
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,195
believed in you
until the very end.

234
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,198
He truly loved this land...

235
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,409
and he worried about his friends
from the bottom of his heart!

236
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,245
And yet...
And yet...!

237
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,623
I won't forgive you, you bastard!

238
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,586
I'm gonna beat the hell outta you!

239
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,798
Next time:
"When Egrets Flap Their Wings"
