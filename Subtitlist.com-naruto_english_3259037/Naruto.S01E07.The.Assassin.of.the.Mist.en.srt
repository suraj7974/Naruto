1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,969
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,812
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,698
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,578
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,540
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,171
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,175
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,177
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,223
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,642
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,525
In fighting

16
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,529
and in love

17
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

18
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,411
Yes, we are on the way

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,793
I wanna rock...

20
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,546
Rockin' my heart

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,611
This is quite some fog.
I can't see ahead.

22
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,625
The bridge should be visible soon.

23
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,337
When we reach the side of the bridge,
we'll be in the Land of the Waves.

24
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:33,279
Wooow!
It's huge!

25
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,365
H-Hey!
Please keep it down.

26
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,784
I took this boat out under cover of fog.

27
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,745
And I cut the engine
and am rowing by hand.

28
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,207
If they find us,
we'll be in deep trouble.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,964
Mr. Tazuna.

30
00:02:55,134 --> 00:03:00,389
I want to ask you something
before we arrive at the pier.

31
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:09,231
The identity of your assailants,
and the reason why they are after you.

32
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,983
If you don't tell us...

33
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,030
our mission may end
when you make landfall.

34
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,078
The Assassin of the Mist

35
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,055
It appears I have no choice
but to tell you.

36
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,266
Frankly, I'd like you to listen.

37
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,019
Just as you said,

38
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,439
this may be beyond
the scope of your mission.

39
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:56,028
Actually, I am being targeted
by a terrifying man.

40
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,656
A terrifying man?

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,242
Who?

42
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,082
You guys have probably heard at
least his name before.

43
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:13,796
A shipping magnate
by the name of Gato.

44
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,467
What? Gato...of the Gato Company?

45
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,345
One of the world's richest men?

46
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,806
Who? What?

47
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,474
Yes...

48
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:30,270
On the surface, he's the chief executive
of a shipping company...

49
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,983
But underneath,
he is into drug-trafficking

50
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,902
and deals in contraband
using gangs and Ninjas.

51
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,321
Moreover, he runs a despicable business,

52
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:43,325
ruthlessly taking over nations
and enterprises.

53
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,999
It was about one year ago...

54
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,210
when that man first set his eyes on
the Land of the Waves...

55
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,631
He used his wealth and violence
to enter this country,

56
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,049
and before anyone knew it,

57
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:04,680
he had taken complete control of the island's
maritime transportation and shipping.

58
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:10,019
Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an
island nation like the Land of the Waves,

59
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:14,606
means having control of finance,
the government, the people...everything.

60
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,819
The one thing Gato fears...

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,197
is the completion of the bridge...

62
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,702
that has been under construction
for some time now.

63
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,622
I see.

64
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,752
Since you're the one building the bridge,
you've become a hindrance.

65
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,965
Then, those Ninjas from before
were Gato's men...?

66
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,471
But I don't understand.

67
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,640
Your opponent is a dangerous one,
who will even use Ninja.

68
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,435
Why did you hide that fact from us
when you made your request?

69
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,104
The Land of the Waves...

70
00:05:55,022 --> 00:06:00,778
is a very poor nation,
and even feudal lords have no money.

71
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,866
Of course, we ordinary citizens
have no money either.

72
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,662
We cannot afford to make requests of
Rank B or higher...

73
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:16,418
Well, if you pull out
of the mission when I land ashore,

74
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,463
I will, no doubt, be killed.

75
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,424
Killed sometime before I make it home.

76
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,886
But there's no need for concern!

77
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,557
Should I die, my cute grandchild
who will turn eight...

78
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,977
will only cry his heart out!

79
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,562
Oh!

80
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,817
And... my daughter will only blame
the Hidden Leaves Ninja

81
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,822
for the rest of her life
and grieve in solitude!

82
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,911
Oh, it's not your fault at all!

83
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,253
Well... I guess we have no choice.

84
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,629
Let's continue as his bodyguards.

85
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,799
Oh! I am most grateful!

86
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,803
I won!

87
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,724
We'll be arriving soon.

88
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,773
Tazuna.

89
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,110
It appears we haven't been noticed
up until this point...

90
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,945
Thanks.

91
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,071
This is as far as I go.
See you around.

92
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,533
Yeah. You've been a big help.

93
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,035
Be careful.

94
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,173
Okay!

95
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,551
Get me home safely.

96
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,969
Right.

97
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:37,226
When they next attack,
it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.

98
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,228
Cripes!

99
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,826
I won't let this guy do
all the fun stuff anymore!

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,833
There!

101
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,265
Heh... Just a mouse.

102
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,684
Quit trying to show off!

103
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,144
There was nothing there
in the first place!

104
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,562
Please, Naruto.

105
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,606
Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.

106
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,941
They're really dangerous.

107
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,569
Hey brat!
Don't be doing anything confusing!

108
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,281
Huh? I sense a presence there!

109
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,324
No, over here?!

110
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,245
There!

111
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,832
Stop it, already!

112
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,964
S-Someone's really been targeting us
the whole time!

113
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,299
Yeah right!

114
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,759
Knock it off, you!

115
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,017
Naruto!
What have you done?!

116
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,893
It's a bunny!

117
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,230
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,108
I didn't mean to...
I'm sorry, bunny.

119
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,027
It's just a rabbit, eh.

120
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,238
That's a snow rabbit.

121
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,783
But that doesn't explain
its fur color...

122
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:22,122
The coat turns white only during winter
when there is little sunlight.

123
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,842
Which means...

124
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:39,014
that snow rabbit was raised indoors
without sunlight to be used as a substitution.

125
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,192
Guess they're already here...

126
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,194
I'm sorry...

127
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:58,158
I see... The Demon Brothers wouldn't
be enough to take on these guys.

128
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,495
The Copy Ninja from the
Village of the Hidden Leaves.

129
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,165
"Sharingan" Kakashi is with them...

130
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,879
Everyone, get down!

131
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,401
If I'm not mistaken, he's...

132
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,324
Here we go!

133
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,535
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!

134
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,995
I'm going to do it this time.

135
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,415
I won't lose to Sasuke!

136
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,667
Well, well.

137
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,380
If it isn't the Rogue Ninja
of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!

138
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,509
Rogue Ninja? Whatever.
What's important now is...

139
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,761
Ready... Go!

140
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,432
You're in the way.

141
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,267
Get back, you guys.

142
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,643
Why?!

143
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,272
He's on a totally different level from
the guys from the other day.

144
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,693
His being our opponent means...

145
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,696
Huh?
Oh.

146
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,575
that things might be tricky
as I am now.

147
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,620
I assume you are Kakashi,
the Sharingan user...

148
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,294
Sorry, but...

149
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,255
I'll have you hand over the old man.

150
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,148
Huh? Huh? Sharingan?
What's that?

151
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,026
What? What is he talking about?

152
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,028
Is this guy strong?

153
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,362
Sharingan...

154
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,782
Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.

155
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,201
Protect Tazuna...

156
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,704
Don't involve yourselves in the fight.

157
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,997
Huh?

158
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,666
That's the teamwork
in this situation.

159
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,713
Huh?!

160
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,427
Fight me.

161
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,265
W-What's this eye...?

162
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,558
Well now...

163
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,521
I never expected to see
the rumored Sharingan this soon...

164
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,772
This is an honor.

165
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,733
Everyone's been saying Sharingan...

166
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,276
What is it?!

167
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,237
...Sharingan.

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,199
Power that the light of the eye generates,
and the pupil emanates.

169
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,161
The user of
the so-called Visual Jutsu (Art)

170
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,664
is said to possess the vision to see through
all Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),

171
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,874
Taijutsu (Physical Art),
and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),

172
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,502
and is able to deflect them.

173
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,591
The Sharingan is a type of eye
that is unique

174
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,468
to the user of the Visual Art.

175
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:08,807
However, that is not the only power of
the Sharingan.

176
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,521
Well said.

177
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,314
That is not all.

178
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,401
What's more frightening is that
such an eye

179
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:24,573
can assess an opponent's techniques
and copy them.

180
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,791
When I was in the Anbu Black Ops
of the Hidden Mist,

181
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,002
search information
about you was in the Bingo Book

182
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,963
I would carry around with me.

183
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,592
There was also something
else in the book...

184
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,053
About the man who has copied
over one thousand skills...

185
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,306
Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

186
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,232
What? Kakashi Sensei
is that incredible a Ninja?

187
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,276
W-Wow!

188
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,114
What does this mean?

189
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,034
The Sharingan...is a special trait

190
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,120
that appears in only a select few
even among the Uchiha clan.

191
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,956
Could it be, that this guy...

192
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,920
Let's end the talking here.

193
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,091
I must kill that old man immediately.

194
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,690
But, Kakashi, it seems
I have to defeat you first.

195
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,785
Over there!
And he's even on the water?

196
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,713
He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!

197
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,516
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.

198
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,735
He's vanished?!

199
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,072
Sensei!

200
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,950
He'll probably come to erase me first...

201
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,202
What is he?

202
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,329
Zabuza Momochi.

203
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,498
He's a Anbu Black Ops member
in the Hidden Mist and

204
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,459
is known as "the silent killing"
technique expert.

205
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,669
S-Silen...?

206
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,671
As the name suggests...

207
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:50,093
it's a killing skill that's implemented
in an instant in silence.

208
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,435
By the time you realize it,

209
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,979
it's possible you may find yourself
in the afterlife.

210
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,316
I haven't totally mastered
the use of my Sharingan.

211
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,318
So don't lower your guard, you guys.

212
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,368
Well, if we fail, we'll only die.

213
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,370
How can you be so carefree?!

214
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,129
The mist is steadily getting thicker!

215
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,048
The Land of the Waves
is surrounded by ocean.

216
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,384
So mist rises very easily.

217
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,513
Sensei!

218
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:46,983
Eight spots.

219
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,235
Huh? What?

220
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,573
The larynx, the spine,
the lungs, the liver...

221
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,451
The jugular and the subclavian veins.

222
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,828
The kidneys, the heart.

223
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,208
Now then, which vulnerable spot
would be good?

224
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,612
What an intense thirst for blood!

225
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,741
If I take even one breath,
or move my eyes,

226
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,578
I will be marked and killed -
that's what I'm feeling.

227
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,542
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad!

228
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,212
Facing a Jonin's intent to kill...

229
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,508
This sensation is like having
my life being held in limbo...

230
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,931
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!

231
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,975
Sasuke.

232
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,647
Don't worry.
I'll protect you with my life.

233
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,736
I will not allow
my comrades to get killed.

234
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,785
I wonder about that...

235
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,210
It's over.

236
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,451
Sensei!
Behind you!

237
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,916
Die!

238
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,095
The Water Clone Jutsu?

239
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,057
It can't be!

240
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,781
In this mist...

241
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,497
did he actually copy me?

242
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,460
Don't move.

243
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,726
It's over.

244
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,709
O-Oh no! Even Kakashi Sensei fell under
Zabuza's Jutsu.

245
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,129
I've got to escape.
I'll get killed, for real.

246
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,548
This pain.

247
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,301
What am I doing?!

248
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,844
I'd decided, hadn't I?

249
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,889
Not to run away no matter what happens.

250
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,226
Next episode:
"The Oath of Pain!"

251
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,521
I'm going to kick butt once again!
