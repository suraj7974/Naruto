1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,366
Gaara.

2
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,326
Kankuro.

3
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,203
Gaara.

4
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,539
Primary Lotus!

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,046
Damn it! Can't hold any further.

6
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,885
You can't even howl like a loser?

7
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,891
Die!

8
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,560
You're mine!

9
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,855
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!

10
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,199
What?!

11
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,832
Who're you?!

12
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,925
Heh... It seems
you're an ally this time...

13
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,518
Who are you?!

14
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,395
A Sand...

15
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,815
...Shinobi...

16
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,025
...ally of the Leaf!

17
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,584
Well, be careful going home.

18
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,669
Okay.

19
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,008
If something happens again,
I'll come to your rescue again...

20
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,011
Just let me know, crybaby.

21
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,474
You always say too much.
That's why girls are...

22
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,109
I'll return the favor twice the amount
from that time.

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
Hey, Shikamaru.
What's the matter?

24
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,379
We'll stand by here for a while.

25
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,172
Stand by?

26
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,593
We don't have time fooling around
in a place like this!

27
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,595
Be quiet for a second, Naruto.

28
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,600
That's right.
Shikamaru's got a proper plan.

29
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:07,229
Right, right. Naruto, you have to
be sure to obey the leader.

30
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,690
Fine.

31
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,584
Shino, I'm counting on you.

32
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:35,883
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

33
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:42,222
into your hands

34
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:01,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

35
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:07,873
because we were always together

36
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:14,046
Your honest reply, "See you..."

37
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,426
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

38
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:26,266
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

39
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

40
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,315
even if I'm not by your side

41
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,571
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

42
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:46,078
into your hands

43
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:51,709
I can feel it so close,

44
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:57,506
Our two hearts

45
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:05,514
Sand Alliance with the Leaf Shinobi

46
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,019
So, Kujaku? What's going on
with our pursuers?

47
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,523
Yeah, we went to the trouble of
leaving footprints as we go.

48
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,483
We need them to follow.

49
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,160
It'll be okay. They'll be within
firing range immediately!

50
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,204
There are three pursuers.
One of them is Gaara!

51
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,374
As for the extra two, we'll leave one
for each respectively

52
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,376
and deal with them with
One Shinobi, One Kill...

53
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,255
I'll isolate Gaara and drive him into
the Reverse Scale Position.

54
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,216
I'll take the first person.

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,926
All right, go.

56
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,651
It's not necessary to drive him
into the Reverse Scale Position.

57
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:04,031
There are only three of them.
I can handle them by myself.

58
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,203
Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword:

59
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,330
Whirlwind!

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,043
What?!

61
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,128
What is this?

62
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,130
A wind user, huh?

63
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,925
Interesting!

64
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,153
– Splendid.
– Not bad, Temari.

65
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,905
Naturally.

66
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,198
Not half bad.

67
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,460
To think you'd blow away my Whirlwind.

68
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,380
What, you're still just a kid?

69
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,300
– You guys go on ahead.
– What?

70
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,387
Hey, Temari. You okay with this?

71
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,596
Will you be okay?

72
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,724
Well, we're fellow wind users.

73
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,769
I should be able to handle her alone.

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,689
Hurry, Gaara.

75
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,190
She's your student, right?

76
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,651
Thanks.

77
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,778
– I'm counting on you.
– Be careful.

78
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,029
Right.

79
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,656
You won't get away.

80
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,158
I'm your opponent.

81
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,994
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu.

82
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,125
Wind Slash.

83
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,384
This wind is...

84
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,680
These double swords alter the wind
at my will to suit the attacks

85
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,099
and amplify the power to the extreme.

86
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,894
It's too late to regret.

87
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,980
I only need a little bit of Chakra
as long as I have these swords.

88
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,233
How long can you pesevere with
the limited Chakra you have?

89
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,694
How about testing that out?

90
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,367
Matsuri.

91
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,538
We caught up.

92
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,749
Where are we?

93
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,834
So you're awake?

94
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,756
Heh. You're like prey plunged on
a branch by a shrike.

95
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,008
You're the bait to lure him out.

96
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,092
What?

97
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,639
Gaara Sensei.

98
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,104
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.

99
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,902
What?

100
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,245
Darn it.

101
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,800
Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

102
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,261
You're just a kid!

103
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,723
I see.

104
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,476
It's an adjustable sword with daggers

105
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,979
connected by an iron wire
going through the center.

106
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,317
Like a Bamboo Snake?
How nostalgic.

107
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,696
I used one a lot with puppet games
when I was a kid.

108
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,867
It can look like a living snake
depending on how it's controlled.

109
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,912
But there's no point
once it's been identified.

110
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,417
Though we both use Puppets,
compared to mine, it's just a kid's toy.

111
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,043
Go, Gaara.

112
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,420
Can I leave it to you?

113
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,799
Yeah. I don't need your help for this.
I'll catch up right away.

114
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,092
I'm counting on you.

115
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,595
Now, bring it on. I'll play with you.

116
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,056
What're you doing acting tough?

117
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,767
You'll die if you take me lightly!

118
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,562
That goes for you!

119
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,773
Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!

120
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,401
Here I go.

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,004
That's no good.

122
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,131
Come on, that was too easy.

123
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,687
Too bad. This sword
isn't just an adjustable sword.

124
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,983
The sword itself amplifies Chakra
in response to my Chakra

125
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,486
and changes into the form of a dragon.

126
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,240
Gaara, I'm sorry.
This might take a little time.

127
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,954
Suiko, you ambush him here.

128
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,582
Draw him into
the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?

129
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,875
Yeah...

130
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,682
You won't get through here.

131
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,560
Gaara, fight me.

132
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,479
Very well.

133
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,605
Bring it.

134
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,834
Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we
going to stay like this?

135
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,463
Shut up. There are many difficulties
with ambushes.

136
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:58,885
Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata
are taking on those difficulties for us.

137
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,554
What? They are?

138
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,399
Did you find them?
Byakugan!

139
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,080
In that direction, right?

140
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,290
Byakugan!

141
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,307
Got it. There are three battle areas.

142
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,571
It's the scent bag of
the female Parasitic Insects.

143
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,367
With this, the insects will find you
no matter where you go.

144
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,661
Right. I'm counting on you, Shino.

145
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,872
Then, we'll be going on ahead.

146
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,248
Be careful!

147
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,835
Oh, information has arrived.

148
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,087
I was getting sick of waiting!

149
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,298
All right, I'm counting on you guys.

150
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,265
This is bad.
It's already begun.

151
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,976
All right, Kiba and Choji,
you take the western forest.

152
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,312
Ino and I will take the northeastern hills.

153
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,982
Naruto and Lee, you take
the northwestern forest.

154
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,444
We'll take on back-up
in two-man cells.

155
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,573
Now then, let's begin
the favor-returning operation.

156
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,783
– Right.
– Right.

157
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,203
I was waiting for this time!

158
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,329
Scatter.

159
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,260
What is it?

160
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,386
Hold up.

161
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,726
If the guys who are fleeing will take on
pursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill,

162
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,854
the battle area not being
a straight line means...

163
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,607
Could it be a Barrier?

164
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,692
What?

165
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,151
Just to be safe.

166
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,625
That should do it. Let's go.

167
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,835
Right.

168
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,357
Now, there's nowhere left to hide.
What will you do?

169
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,278
To think she'd evade all of my attacks.

170
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,323
Since it's come to this, I've just got to
use that technique!

171
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,287
Wind Style: Sea Dragon!

172
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,879
What's that? Nothing's happening.

173
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,342
How pitiful. It seems the wind
doesn't like you.

174
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,552
I don't know about that.

175
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,143
The wind is my friend.

176
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,665
This battle is just starting.

177
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,167
Wind Reversal!

178
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,598
Die!

179
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,813
Darn it! Hey, let go!

180
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:24,984
Done already? I thought
we could play a little more...

181
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,660
That's the spirit!

182
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,002
What kind of toy is it this time?

183
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:01,855
That's funny. You think you can
defeat me with junk like this?

184
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,358
The junk is your sword.

185
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,049
What?! A three-headed dragon!

186
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,677
You're just quick to escape, eh?

187
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,514
Darn it.

188
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,975
Sure enough,
Crow is at a disadvantage

189
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,727
unless teamed up with Black Ant.

190
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,292
Not bad, Gaara of the desert.

191
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,047
How much Chakra is built up
in that sand?

192
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,965
You want to test that out?

193
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,884
However...

194
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,970
It'll be in exchange for your life.

195
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,937
Sand Coffin!

196
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,788
Impossible.

197
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,292
That's a nice sand bath.

198
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,420
You, the sand's Chakra...

199
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,883
Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra.

200
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,893
Aw, is this good night?

201
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,438
Just sleep as is! For all eternity!!

202
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,696
What?!

203
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,793
That was a close shave,

204
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,170
but Shadow Possession Jutsu
was a success!

205
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,051
Die already!

206
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,013
Uh, oh!

207
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,182
What?

208
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,784
You guys.

209
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,119
Who are you?

210
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:04,954
Who are you guys?

211
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,916
– An ally of the Sand.
– An ally of the Sand.

212
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,168
– Leaf Shinobi.
– Leaf Shinobi

213
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,836
Believe it!

214
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,630
He's not here!

215
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,089
– They're further ahead.
– Right!

216
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,260
Guys, fight as much as you want.

217
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,097
I don't see any Chakra abnormalities
in the basin...

218
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,725
There's no Barrier.

219
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,646
Good luck, guys.

220
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,357
I'll protect you.

221
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,246
Gaara Sensei.

222
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,133
Just wait, Gaara!

223
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,345
We'll return the favor, no matter what.

224
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,311
The Key to the rusted heart's door

225
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:16,192
Will always be smiling right near by

226
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,619
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

227
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:31,207
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

228
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,712
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

229
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,717
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

230
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,138
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

231
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:50,143
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

232
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,397
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

233
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

234
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:06,034
The wind is probably testing our hearts

235
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,788
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

236
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:15,460
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

237
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:20,339
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

238
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,552
The Key to the rusted heart's door

239
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:30,725
Will always be smiling right near by

240
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,569
Damn it.
This was their aim from the start.

241
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,572
To think they would take advantage
of the terrain.

242
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,659
Damn. At this rate,
Gaara will be in danger.

243
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:52,205
That's been said,
we can't move from here.

244
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,249
Please hurry, Naruto, Lee.

245
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,586
You two are the only ones
who can help Gaara now.

246
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,923
Next time:
"Sealed Sand: the Counterattack!"
