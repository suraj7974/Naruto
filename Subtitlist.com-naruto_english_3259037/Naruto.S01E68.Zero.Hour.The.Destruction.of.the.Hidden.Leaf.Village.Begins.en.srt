1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,228
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,958
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,100
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,566
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,903
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,797
One more time

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,017
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!

24
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,063
Zero Hour! The Destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!

25
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,410
Lord Hokage!

26
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,495
Leave it to me!

27
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,291
Lord Kazekage!
What is going on?

28
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,964
Lord Hokage!

29
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
Gaara!

30
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,809
Squad One, above. Squad Two, below!
Protect the lords!

31
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,776
You're in the way!

32
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,881
Lord Hokage...
Please...flee...

33
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,612
It's finally our time to
come on the scene.

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,156
We've been transformed
such a long time.

35
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,075
I'm totally pent up with frustration.

36
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,786
You guys smell all sweaty!

37
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,497
Come on, we're all comrades, right...?

38
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,000
Sound Ninja...!

39
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,338
Raido...

40
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,298
We're heading out to
back up Lord Hokage.

41
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,591
Be careful of any traps!

42
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,177
Do it...

43
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,012
Yes sir!

44
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,433
– Ninja Art! Four Flames Formation!
– Ninja Art! Four Flames Formation!

45
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,070
Barrier...!

46
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,997
Lord Kazekage...

47
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,336
Barrier Ninjutsu, huh?!

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,047
To think that they could outwit Anbu...

49
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,091
They're not just ordinary...

50
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,513
What are you doing here?!
Lord Hokage is in danger!

51
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,359
What a nuisance...

52
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,945
To think that the enemy was
masquerading as our Anbu...

53
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,407
So it was also that guy
who used Genjutsu!

54
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,076
Yeah...there's no mistake.

55
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,539
I didn't expect that...

56
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,792
Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.

57
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:57,673
The treaty is simply a camouflage to
make the enemy let down their guard.

58
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,926
The petty little battle game ends now.

59
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,596
From this point on, the course
of history will change!

60
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,810
Are you saying that
you're starting a war?

61
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,104
That's right.

62
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,941
One should avoid resolution
through armed force

63
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,361
and should rather seek
a solution through negotiations.

64
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,949
There's still time...Lord Kazekage!

65
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,790
Perhaps one gets addicted to
peace as one grows older...

66
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,209
Sarutobi Sensei!

67
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,089
You're...

68
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,392
Just my bad luck...

69
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,269
to have lookout duty
on a day like this.

70
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,939
I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.

71
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,441
Stop fussing.

72
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,943
The Chunin Exam takes
place twice a year.

73
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,695
You'll have many more chances
to see it.

74
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,116
But this year, that kid from
the Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,910
And I won't have
a chance to see that...

76
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,454
I won't be able to die peacefully.

77
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,582
What's that?!

78
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,308
It's time! Begin!

79
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,069
The Summoning has succeeded.

80
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,158
Huge boa!

81
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,910
Notify Lord Hokage immediately!

82
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,095
I'm not letting you in the village!

83
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,860
-Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!
-Yes sir!

84
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,207
Sand Ninja!

85
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,547
What's going on?

86
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,174
Stop that, Gaara!

87
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,344
I'll kill him...!

88
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,308
There's no meaning in
continuing this fight!

89
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,101
Don't forget our mission!

90
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,687
Out of my way...!

91
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,524
What are you guys doing?!

92
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,235
The operation is already underway!

93
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,127
What in the world is going on?

94
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,964
Gaara!

95
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,217
What's the matter?!

96
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,721
His wound is deeper than
I thought!

97
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,641
And moreover his Chakra
is pretty drained!

98
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,310
In that case,
what about using that thing...?

99
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,103
That's impossible to do right away!

100
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,648
Idiot! It's all because
you didn't wait for the signal

101
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,858
and tried to become
the Perfect Possession...

102
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,110
What should we do?!

103
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,820
Are you saying we have to do
this without Gaara?

104
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,168
Isn't Gaara here yet?!

105
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,552
Gaara is Sand's trump card.

106
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,014
We have to get Gaara to do his work,
no matter what!

107
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,435
You guys leave for the moment and
tend to Gaara's wounds!

108
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,480
As soon as Gaara's Chakra has
been restored...

109
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,274
the operation will recommence!

110
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:26,984
Got it!

111
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,196
What about you, Sensei?!

112
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,699
I'm gonna suppress those guys!

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,370
Do you think things will
go according to your plan?

114
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,624
I'll make them so...

115
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,557
Go!

116
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,642
Okay!

117
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,736
Is Orochimaru the host of this party?

118
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,451
Dunno... In any case,
let's heat this thing up.

119
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,459
Sasuke...

120
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,630
Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.

121
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,926
You've already achieved Chunin level.

122
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,056
If you're a Leaf Shinobi,
be of service to the Leaf!

123
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,393
In other words, I'm supposed to
take down that jerk Gaara, right?

124
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,020
A continuation of earlier on, right?

125
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,605
Don't pursue too far.

126
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,691
From here on, it's no longer an exam.
It's the real thing!

127
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,944
What I have to do though...
is the same!

128
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,198
I won't let him through!

129
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,295
Sasuke...!

130
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,091
Boy oh boy...

131
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:19,304
We intended to take Sasuke
while Gaara was causing the trouble.

132
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,767
But not everything goes as planned.

133
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,522
I see... Is that so?

134
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,316
So Leaf Village and...

135
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,736
Sasuke were the target, huh?

136
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:38,198
Is the Leaf such a big catch?

137
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,953
More importantly,
if Gaara wakes up,

138
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,456
I'll be able to show you something
much more interesting.

139
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, anyway...

140
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,629
Your thick-headedness has caused
the Leaf to be outmaneuvered.

141
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,965
It's my win.

142
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,845
Nothing is decided
until the very end.

143
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,597
I believe that's what I taught you...

144
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,733
Orochimaru.

145
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,617
I thought this day would
eventually arrive.

146
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,661
However...

147
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,708
You won't get my head that easily!

148
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,086
I told you, didn't I?

149
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,131
It is preferable to decide
the Fifth Hokage quickly...

150
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,675
Third Hokage...

151
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,138
because you will...die here.

152
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,365
I wonder how the Chunin Exams
are going?

153
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,369
I wonder if Naruto's match is over yet?

154
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,207
The first match was
with Neji, right?

155
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,502
I want him to win that
match somehow or other.

156
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,295
That's no good!

157
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,631
A teacher mustn't root for
one particular student!

158
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,508
All the graduating students
are dear to him!

159
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,635
I must root for all of them equally!

160
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,185
But I still...want Naruto to win...

161
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,104
Are you worried about Naruto?

162
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,898
Well, of course...!

163
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,318
As I thought...

164
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,947
Y-You guys...

165
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,283
I told you to do ten laps around
the school grounds, didn't I?!

166
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,911
We finished that long ago.

167
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,580
While you were daydreaming, Sensei.

168
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,503
When our teacher is in that state,
he can't teach a class!

169
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,672
So let's call it quits for today!

170
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,717
N-No, no!
I'm continuing with class.

171
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,847
I wonder what that smoke is...?

172
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,851
That's coming from the direction
of the exam arena...

173
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,731
Isn't there some disturbance
to the east?

174
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,609
I wonder if something happened?

175
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,533
That Orochimaru...

176
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,536
What should we do?
Should we send reinforcements?

177
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,248
No... It's dangerous to make a move
when we don't really know

178
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,541
what the situation is.

179
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,419
If the mastermind is Orochimaru...

180
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,712
even more so.

181
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,800
Is Orochimaru...
that dangerous a guy?

182
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,763
Originally...he was a student
of the Third Hokage.

183
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,975
So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?

184
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,771
Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage
was decided...

185
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,818
Orochimaru apparently asserted that
he was capable of taking on that role.

186
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,321
But his request was denied.

187
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,034
And shortly afterwards,
that guy slipped out of this village.

188
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,202
Orochimaru most likely holds a grudge

189
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,913
against the Third Hokage because of that.

190
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,333
Revenge...is it?

191
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,209
Probably.

192
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,379
Long ago, when I was a kid...

193
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,343
there's one thing I remember
thinking when I saw that guy...

194
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,808
That he didn't seem human...

195
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,729
That he seems to be something
that just took on a human form...

196
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,066
Frightening...

197
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,403
Simply...frightening.

198
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,200
Reporting!

199
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,952
A large boa has appeared near
the eastern gate of the Leaf Village!

200
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,623
And behind it, some one hundred
Sand Ninja are infiltrating the country!

201
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,125
They are currently engaged in
armed conflict with our Shinobi

202
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,210
who were patrolling nearby!

203
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:01,920
The Sand...?!

204
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,799
Leave Squad One and Two behind

205
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,218
and make for the eastern gate.
Immediately!

206
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,302
– Yes sir!
– Yes sir!

207
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,357
We won't let you past this point!

208
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,207
There's quite a large number.

209
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,084
We were careless!

210
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,086
And even Lord Hokage has been...

211
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,797
Kakashi!

212
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,049
-Look inside the Barrier!
-Yeah.

213
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,051
What...?

214
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,350
Orochimaru!

215
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,936
Orochimaru?!

216
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,856
Why is that guy...?

217
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,192
Don't tell me that
they're after Sasuke again?!

218
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,070
Sasuke!

219
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,115
Huh?

220
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,242
He's not there...?

221
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,382
Sakura, stay there for a while.

222
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,301
I'm gonna go reduce
the number of enemies.

223
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,752
Darn! I'm worried about
Lord Hokage, but...

224
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,879
Leave above to Anbu.

225
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,633
Besides...
Lord Hokage isn't the kind of guy

226
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,551
who can be taken down that easily.

227
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,678
But...

228
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,806
After all,

229
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,434
he is the Hokage of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

230
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,073
Are you so happy, you're crying?

231
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,991
Or...

232
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,747
do you have an iota of sadness
in your heart

233
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,833
to kill me, your teacher?

234
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,794
No...

235
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,479
Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy...

236
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,940
but I'm finally awake.

237
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,403
That's what I thought.

238
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,453
I know you aren't someone
who would hold a grudge.

239
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,332
You have neither a goal nor motive.

240
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,877
Hmm... I guess...

241
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,963
I do kind of have a goal.

242
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,716
If I were to explain it...

243
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,970
It's interesting to watch things
that move.

244
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,891
I get no pleasure if
something doesn't move.

245
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,977
Like a windmill that doesn't turn...

246
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,690
Well, it may have some kind
of appeal once in a while.

247
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,610
But usually,
it's not worth looking at it.

248
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,865
Right now...with a wind called
"Destroy the Leaf Village,"

249
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,743
I want to turn that windmill.

250
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,205
You're the same as always...

251
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,891
Sakura!

252
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,436
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu

253
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,688
survival training during the Genin Exam.

254
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,400
You truly have a talent for it.

255
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,777
Huh?

256
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,405
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!

257
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,038
Naruto will be delighted.

258
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,624
He'll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

259
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,377
What do you mean by a mission?

260
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,587
Be careful...

261
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,175
It's the first A-ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

262
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:09,769
Everyone makes mistakes

263
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:15,066
It's nothing to be ashamed about

264
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:20,279
Don't let this scar be for naught

265
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:26,035
Walk with a smile

266
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,630
Yes, breathe in the air

267
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:41,634
Lift your face to the sky and jump

268
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,554
If it rains, take a break

269
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,015
Go where the wind takes you

270
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,642
So many regrets

271
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,145
Don't let this scar be for naught

272
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,564
Let's go carve the badges in our chest

273
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,191
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

274
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:02,488
Everyone makes mistakes

275
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:07,744
It's nothing to be ashamed about

276
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:13,041
Don't let this scar be for naught

277
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:18,296
Walk with a smile

278
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:23,551
Transform sadness into the wind

279
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:28,848
and continue to forge on

280
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:34,562
Forge on strong

281
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,535
Yes! I've been waiting for this!

282
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,789
Finally, it's the first A-Ranked mission
in a while!

283
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,499
Listen, Sakura and Shikamaru!

284
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,376
As long as I'm with you,
it will be an easy one.

285
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm the super hero who
can wake a sleeping lion.

286
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,090
Just keep watching

287
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,676
Mr. Naruto's stellar performance!

288
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,555
Next time: "Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!"

289
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,349
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
