1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,186
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,578
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,540
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,258
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,051
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,891
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,904
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,161
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,459
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,171
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,316
This is good! Bit by bit,
I'm figuring out the timing...

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,949
He read my movement.

22
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,284
No way could he do that!

23
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,788
Darn!
We were so close...!

24
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,499
Naruto, can you still move?

25
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,169
Of course! I'm totally fine!

26
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,840
He's pretty much spent...
and it's no wonder.

27
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,176
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,887
But thanks to him,
we found our way out.

29
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,265
I found the way to break through!

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,977
Hah! Impossible!

31
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,315
That was just a coincidence.

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,487
Naruto! Run!

33
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,824
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,201
A-All right!

35
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,830
You won't be able to...!

36
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,136
I-I'm not going to lose!

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,806
There!

38
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,267
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

39
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,336
Darn!

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,713
T-That was good just now!

41
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,797
What?

42
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,342
We're doing it one more time!

43
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,011
All right!

44
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,601
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!

45
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,062
To prove that,
he's little by little...

46
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,154
This won't go as you've planned.

47
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,907
First, I'll get you!

48
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,872
Sasuke!

49
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,719
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,807
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...

51
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:34,525
Be calm...Think...
What will he come after?

52
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,819
Oh no!

53
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,712
What?!
Too late!

54
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,310
The Broken Seal

55
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,900
That was Sakura's voice!

56
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,445
Did something happen?

57
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,281
What's that Kakashi doing?

58
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,287
Sa...kura...

59
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,914
Darn it... I must do something...

60
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,211
I'll do something about it...

61
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,756
T-This guy...

62
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,883
Here I go...

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,137
It's pointless to struggle.

64
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,154
Naruto, behind you!!

65
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
Naruto!

66
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,915
It's impossible for you
to get out of here.

67
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,958
I mean it.

68
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,170
Can you stand up, Naruto?

69
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,047
Y-Yeah...

70
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,341
From now on,
don't waste your Chakra!

71
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,301
You're playing right into his hands.

72
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,596
I know.

73
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,474
Darn it!

74
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,392
If things continue like this,
it's going to be really bad.

75
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,019
I...

76
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,188
I have to do something.

77
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,568
Strangely, my eyes have adjusted...

78
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:45,280
It's about the time I put
an end to this for you...

79
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,495
What?!

80
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,667
Stand up, you idiot!

81
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:04,716
I'm aiming for a vital spot...
but he's parrying all of them .

82
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,306
I know...
you're so persistent!

83
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,815
A coincidence...
No, that's not it.

84
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:25,320
On the contrary, he's fighting
while covering for his friend.

85
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,450
Surely, my movements...

86
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,789
That boy...he can see something.

87
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,750
What in the world...?

88
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,170
Okay, in that case...

89
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,422
He disappeared.

90
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,133
Where, where did he disappear to?!

91
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,927
Naruto! Don't faint!

92
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,889
I can't take care of you
any more than I am now!

93
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,850
Who asked you to take care of me...

94
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,732
It seems that kid has
reached his limits.

95
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,864
Tsk...

96
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,117
Amazing...
That's an amazing move.

97
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,412
You move well...

98
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,164
Wha...?!

99
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,917
But I'll stop you
with the next one.

100
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,336
Motor function...

101
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,757
Reflexes...
Ability to judge a situation...

102
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,721
All of these things...
should be at their limits!

103
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,266
He's coming!

104
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,102
Calm down...

105
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,855
Focus!

106
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,026
And ...
See everything!

107
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,666
He saw through absolutely everything?!

108
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,918
No way...

109
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,931
Those eyes...

110
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,516
It can't be...

111
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,936
Sharingan...

112
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,358
You are...

113
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,360
Only a little, but...

114
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,654
I was able to see!

115
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,785
So, you also have the power
of Kekkei Genkai...

116
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,247
What a kid...

117
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,207
It's not perfect yet,

118
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,336
but to think that in the middle of a battle
he was able to rouse this power...

119
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:52,050
If that's the case,
I can't fight him too long...

120
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,554
This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.

121
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,099
There are also limits to retaining
the teleportation speed.

122
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,228
Besides, the longer the fight continues,

123
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,941
the more my movements will enter
into the range of his "reading."

124
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:14,031
In fact, his eyes
have already captured me.

125
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,537
It would be foolish to aim
straight at him.

126
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,497
In that case...

127
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,586
I'll use that kid to lure him in!

128
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,340
What?!

129
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,800
Let me make it in time!

130
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,940
K-Kakashi Sensei!

131
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,361
You were late entering
to guard, Kakashi.

132
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:57,366
Your whole-hearted intent to help
those kids has gone to your head,

133
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,743
and it seems to have clouded
your Sharingan

134
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,912
with even heavier fog.

135
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,290
Even though you have
those impressive eyes,

136
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,252
your ability to read your enemy's
movements is getting cloudy.

137
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,549
Amuse me more, Kakashi...

138
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,595
I want to repay my debt in
an amusing way.

139
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:26,311
Don't worry. Anytime now,
Haku is going to defeat those kids.

140
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,197
You better apologize to them
in tears

141
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,201
when you are in "the next world"
for your lack of strength.

142
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,484
Sasuke will be defeated...?

143
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,737
That's not true!

144
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,781
Sasuke is...

145
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,533
Cha!

146
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,618
Not by that guy!

147
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,495
Cha!

148
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,622
He won't be defeated!

149
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,083
Cha!

150
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,419
Naruto won't either!

151
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,337
That's right.

152
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,422
Huh!

153
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:43,054
I...believe in their strength.

154
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,020
Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja...

155
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,023
And Sasuke is a member of
the most excellent clan

156
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,651
in the Hidden Leaf Village!

157
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,695
That can't be!

158
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,659
Yes...
His name is Sasuke Uchiha...

159
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,871
He bears within his body...

160
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,373
the famous Kekkei Genkai
of the Uchiha clan!

161
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,959
He's a Ninja genius.

162
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,591
He's the remaining survivor
of that tragic clan?!

163
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,685
No wonder he grows so quickly.

164
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,314
But...

165
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,400
That's the same as Haku.

166
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:42,155
Nobody has ever beaten
that secret Jutsu of Haku's

167
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,200
Not one person in the past...

168
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,788
Well then...

169
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,874
It's about time I settled this too, huh.

170
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,043
Sakura, don't move from here.

171
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,004
Uh...ah...okay!

172
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,056
No, I'm going to put
an end to this!

173
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,735
For God's sake, you...

174
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,198
just won't quit...
dragging my feet, will you?

175
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,742
You did it!
Sasuke...!

176
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,676
W-What kind of expression
is that...

177
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:50,348
You...idiot...!

178
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,311
W-Why?!

179
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,106
You protected me...?!

180
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:04,112
How the hell...should I know?

181
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:30,013
Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!

182
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,478
Hmph...

183
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,773
You...

184
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,734
I hated you...

185
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:48,156
Why? Why...?

186
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,201
Why...me...?

187
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,418
I didn't ask for your help!!

188
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,383
I don't know...

189
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:11,471
My body moved...of its own accord...

190
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,264
Fool...!

191
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,445
Sasuke!

192
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,408
That man...

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,580
Until I defeated...my brother...

194
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,502
I absolutely refused to die...

195
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,921
That's what I decided, but...

196
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,514
You, don't die...

197
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:31,968
He...

198
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,941
To protect someone dear to him...

199
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,404
he would plunge in
knowing it was a trap...

200
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,202
He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.

201
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,457
Is this the first time you faced
a friend's death?

202
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,294
This is the way of the Shinobi...

203
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,967
Shut up!

204
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,227
Even though I...
hated you too...

205
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,363
I won't forgive you...

206
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,302
I'm going to kill you!

207
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,480
What is this Chakra?!

208
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,194
It can't be...

209
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,698
For Chakras to be tangible like that...

210
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:22,745
A-And...what a ghastly Chakra that is...

211
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,847
The wound on his hand...
It's healing instantly...

212
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,808
This boy...

213
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,727
Who in hell is he...?

214
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,572
Is it Zabuza...?

215
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,824
No!

216
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,577
This sinister Chakra was once...

217
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,914
It can't be!

218
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,791
What is...this Chakra?

219
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,877
It feels foul...

220
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,882
Kakashi?
No, it's too big to be Kakashi's...

221
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,384
Who is it?

222
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,388
Naruto...!

223
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,731
Oh no...

224
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,193
At the time like this...

225
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,945
The seal has broken...?

226
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,905
I have to hurry!

227
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,066
He's coming!

228
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,042
How dare you!

229
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,797
You ruined Sasuke!
Damn you!

230
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,466
Sasuke's dream...

231
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,513
What about dream?!

232
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,432
Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!

233
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,143
Because of your dream...!

234
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,940
