1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,481
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,862
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,408
Down a difficult road filled
with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,662
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,458
An insightful crow comes along

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,836
to tear up the map

11
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,173
Now open your eyes

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,010
and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

15
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,441
Fighting Dreamers don't care
what people think about them

16
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,903
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

17
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,615
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

18
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,160
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best!

20
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,755
Right here right now (Burn) We're
gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

22
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,813
This man Jiraiya

23
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,689
does not fall victim

24
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,651
to any woman's allurement,

25
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:53,614
but rather his forte is
winning women's affections!

26
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,224
You were totally excited by a lame
tactic like a woman winking at you!

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,102
You shouldn't be the one to try acting
all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!

28
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,439
Like I said,
don't call me that in front of people...

29
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,316
Be quiet...

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,693
More importantly

31
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,320
these people aren't normal, Pervy Sage!

32
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,989
Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!

33
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,074
Like I said, don't call me "Pervy Sage"!

34
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,706
You are, after all, Master Jiraiya,

35
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,792
one of the legendary Sannin...

36
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,671
I didn't believe that I'd be
able to stop you so easily

37
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,675
despite the fact that you are
a huge womanizer.

38
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,135
What?!

39
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,513
You know the true identity of Pervy Sage?!

40
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:05,477
Well no, that's not
necessarily who I really am...

41
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,941
Seems like you released the Genjutsu
that we had put on that woman.

42
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,365
You shouldn't call yourself a man
for using such a cowardly tactic

43
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,244
like casting a Genjutsu on
the woman with your hypnotic eyes

44
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:25,873
to separate me and Naruto.

45
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,250
Separate us...

46
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,044
Why would they do that?

47
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,048
Your target is Naruto, after all.

48
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,515
You are

49
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,268
after the Nine-Tailed Fox in Naruto...

50
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,855
No wonder Kakashi knew that as well...

51
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,982
I see clearly now.

52
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,361
The information source was you.

53
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,531
To abduct Naruto

54
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:04,703
is the No.1 priority placed by
our organization, Akatsuki!

55
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,165
What's going on...?

56
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,262
I can't let you have Naruto...

57
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,557
I wonder about that.

58
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,893
This is perfect...

59
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,398
I'll get rid of you two right here!

60
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,482
Don't butt in...

61
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,122
The one that's going to kill him is ...

62
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,502
Me!

63
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,091
Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan

64
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:01,844
Sasuke...

65
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,721
Revenge, I see...

66
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,108
Right now, I have no interest in you...

67
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,028
Don't mess with me!

68
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,617
Sasuke!

69
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,873
Darn you!

70
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,917
Naruto! I told you not to butt in!

71
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,425
I told you before...

72
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,346
I've lived only for this very day...

73
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,391
for this very day!

74
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,002
Sasuke...

75
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,886
Not yet...

76
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,140
You can't even make a hand
sign together at this point...

77
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,226
This is...

78
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,729
my battle!

79
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,607
Fine.

80
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,109
Wha...?

81
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,737
You heard that didn't you?

82
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,615
This is their battle.

83
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,118
Let's not bother with it.

84
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,922
Fine then!

85
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,595
Wh-Why...?

86
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,316
Our power difference hasn't
changed at all since that time...

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,194
Why is that?

88
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,447
He doesn't show any mercy.

89
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,708
What have I... been doing all this time?

90
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,462
Whatever have I...

91
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,056
You are weak.

92
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,059
And you are weak...

93
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,731
because you don't have enough hate.

94
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,247
This place is...

95
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,199
This place is...

96
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:53,909
Could it be?!

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,001
That's right.

98
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,674
This is our house.

99
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,303
Dad! Mom!

100
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,524
You are weak.

101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,235
For the next 24 hours...

102
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,070
Stop it...

103
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,324
Relive that day.

104
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,121
Stop it!

105
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,567
Uncle! Auntie!

106
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,697
You're not even worth killing.

107
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,366
Foolish younger brother...

108
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,368
If you want to kill me,

109
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,913
begrudge me! Hate me!

110
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,876
And keep on surviving in
that unsightly manner...

111
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,253
Just continue fleeing and fleeing

112
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,464
and hang onto your life!

113
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,432
Hasn't changed at all...

114
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,018
Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realm
on your own little brother.

115
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,236
Stop it already! You!

116
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,457
Wha...?!

117
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,217
Th-This...

118
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,720
Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!

119
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,608
How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.

120
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,653
You guys are already inside my stomach!

121
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,117
I summoned the esophagus of the giant
toad of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.

122
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,495
You guys are wanted criminals anyway.

123
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:47,582
I'll turn you guys into
fodder for the stone toad.

124
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,669
What?!

125
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,630
Wh-What is this?

126
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,425
Naruto, you stay still!

127
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,303
Don't worry, it's my Jutsu!

128
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,265
Come here, Kisame!

129
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,893
Oh!

130
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,312
Darn it!

131
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,817
It's useless!

132
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,737
There hasn't been one person who has
been able to escape from this!

133
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,372
A wall of flesh is charging at us!

134
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,722
The wall is faster.

135
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,265
At this rate...

136
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,778
Hey... Pervy Sage!

137
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,657
What's the matter?!

138
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,243
Huh!

139
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,204
They've gone!

140
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,796
I cannot believe that this wall
has been torn through...

141
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,553
Why must we retreat?

142
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,847
You would be...

143
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,851
We have no reason to rush to get
Naruto in the current condition.

144
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,645
Besides,

145
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:36,149
I have to rest my body
somewhere for a while.

146
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,864
Not just Tsukuyomi,

147
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,742
but he also made me use Amaterasu as well...

148
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,713
What is this fire?

149
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,008
-It's black...
-Don't get so close!

150
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,224
How did those guys manage to get out?

151
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,685
Not only that...

152
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,771
What are these black flames?

153
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,901
The stone toad who has the ability to
blow fire had its intestine's burned...

154
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,156
Huh...?

155
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,374
All right!

156
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,336
Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!

157
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,574
All right!

158
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,202
It'll be okay for now.

159
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,705
Now for Sasuke!

160
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,294
Sasuke!

161
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,735
Sasuke...

162
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,536
Dynamic...

163
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,456
-Guy?!
-Entry!

164
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,386
Well... Eh...

165
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm sorry to have kicked you so directly.

166
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,142
I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror...

167
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,314
I used this headband instead,
but it was hard to see.

168
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,650
And I assumed this rough-hewn
face was the enemy...

169
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,695
I just let the flames of the burning
juvenescence take over me...

170
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:27,779
I'm sorry!

171
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,032
Is that ... supposed to be an apology?

172
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,285
I'm a simple-minded guy
just like how my face looks.

173
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,788
It doesn't really matter.

174
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,999
More importantly,
we have to get Sasuke to the Medical Team!

175
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,334
Yes!

176
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,254
He's broken his arm and ribs.

177
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,381
Not only that, he's lost consciousness

178
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,718
from some kind of mental blow
he received from the Visual Jutsu!

179
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,888
This boy also experienced that Jutsu...

180
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:58,184
Hey Pervy Sage!
Is Sasuke going to be all right?

181
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:04,023
Seems like he's received a significant
amount of mental damage.

182
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,363
I'm going to kill you!

183
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,539
Die!

184
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
-You jerk!
-You're in the way!

185
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,545
Darn...

186
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,006
Why?!

187
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,302
What did that guy do to Sasuke?!

188
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,970
Hey, Pervy Sage!

189
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,807
We've gotta change our plan!

190
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,601
I got scared earlier,

191
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,977
but this time

192
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm going to chase those
black-capes and get them!

193
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,234
It's me that they want, right?!

194
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,530
Then, I'll be the one to make my way over!

195
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,406
Humph,

196
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,993
you're only going to be
killed if you go now.

197
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,496
They're at a totally
different level from you.

198
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,166
I just managed

199
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,253
to get you away from them...

200
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,091
Then, are we just going
to keep running away?!

201
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,469
Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!

202
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,221
Shut your mouth for a second!

203
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,687
You are weak.

204
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,901
I'm sorry, Guy.

205
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,696
I thought that I had spared
the boy's feeling, but...

206
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,533
I should have saved him much sooner.

207
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,914
Kakashi has also come
down with the same Jutsu...

208
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,166
We don't know when he will
regain consciousness.

209
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,002
Kakashi Sensei?!

210
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,645
When my students are hurt...

211
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,566
I always wish,
from the bottom of my heart...

212
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,193
If that person,

213
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,947
who is a medical specialist, were here...

214
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:05,371
That's why we're going to go find her now.

215
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,374
What? You mean, her?

216
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,181
Could it be...?

217
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,278
W-Wait...!

218
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,073
C-Could this money be...?!

219
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,117
Yup, that's right...

220
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,287
The one who uses the slug
and drives illness away,

221
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,040
and who is also one of the Sannin like me...

222
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,292
All right!

223
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,796
We're going to turn
around our luck with this!

224
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,507
Princess Tsunade

225
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,842
with the letter "Gamble" on her back!

226
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,272
A cycle of hardship, right?

227
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:18,277
Inside, we were crying, right?

228
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:24,784
But the one thing we won't give up

229
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

230
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,415
It's a secondary role,

231
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,629
a role in the shadows

232
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

233
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,557
let us stay centered, let us stay true

234
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,311
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

235
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:57,025
Over and over, we kept coming back up

236
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:02,864
Over and over,

237
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,160
we believed and dreamed

238
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,582
Over and over, we've seen fools

239
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:18,046
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

240
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,300
Now, it's our turn...

241
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:28,139
Let us bask in our dreams

242
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,857
It's festival, festival,festival!

243
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,233
I'm going to spend like
there's no tomorrow!

244
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,359
Wait a minute, Naruto!

245
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,529
-I will keep your wallet for you.
-Huh?!

246
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,823
It's been said since ages past
that three forbidden factors:

247
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,786
money, alcohol, and women,
are believed to cause Ninja failures.

248
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,413
I am not like you, Pervy Sage!

249
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:56,042
All right!
I am going to enjoy the festival!

250
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,046
Next time: "A New Training Begins:
I Will Be Strong!"

251
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,548
Wait. What are we gonna
do about my training?
