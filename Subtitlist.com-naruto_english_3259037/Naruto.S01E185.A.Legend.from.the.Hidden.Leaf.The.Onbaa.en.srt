1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,804
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,237
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,868
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,579
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,082
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,503
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,177
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,890
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,412
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,854
Sorry, sorry.

17
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,110
Was that some eagle poop
just now?

18
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,486
Nothing there, huh?

19
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,530
Well, I worked up a sweat,

20
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,198
so I guess I'll go home
and take a shower.

21
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,925
A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:
The Onbaa!

22
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,557
I worked up
a good sweat today too.

23
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,406
What's the deal, Akamaru?

24
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,992
He says you smell bad, Naruto.

25
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,952
Are you making sure
to take a bath?

26
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,580
Don't be saying rude things!

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,707
No, you seriously stink.

28
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,791
Come to think of it...

29
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,835
The poop from the eagle
a moment ago might...

30
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
Sakura.

31
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,467
Oh, I found a slacker
who can't get a mission!

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,969
That's just...
I'm not that much a slacker!

33
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,306
So it seems. You must've done
some reckless training.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,269
It's ripped.
Huh? You're right. I didn't notice!

35
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,230
It can't be helped.

36
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,942
Bring it to me later.
I'll sew it up for you.

37
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,985
Really?! Really?! Really?!

38
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,155
Sakura, you're such a nice person.

39
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:04,370
It's the first time in my life...
you've been this nice to me!

40
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,331
H-Hey, Naruto. You're exaggerating.

41
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,250
Naruto!

42
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,096
Wh-What're you doing, Sakura?!

43
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,307
You touched my breast
just now, didn't you?!

44
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,644
I didn't do anything like that!

45
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,189
Then, what're those hairy hands
sticking out from your armpit?!

46
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,611
What's...that?

47
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,530
Huh? Huh?!

48
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,614
Wh-What's this?!

49
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,951
Your back.
Huh?

50
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,079
Wh-What in the world is this?!

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,502
It's a huge poop!

52
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,171
Idiot! That's some kind of creature!

53
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,631
Is it a caterpillar?!

54
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,550
What?! Get it off.

55
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,760
No, this is an animal.

56
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,431
Let go!

57
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,646
Give me a break.

58
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,994
You guys, have you ever heard
of the legend of Onbaa?

59
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,454
Onbaa?

60
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,622
I've never heard of it!

61
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,500
Shizune! You don't know?

62
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:38,422
Nope. Is that legend something like
an old tale or something?

63
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,425
That's what I thought, but...

64
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,765
Long ago when I was young,
I heard about a legend...

65
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,476
A legend about a dangerous,
hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa

66
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,395
who lived deep in the mountains
near the village...

67
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,774
One day, that idiot Jiraiya
eagerly went into the forest

68
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,277
saying he was going to investigate
the Onbaa

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,112
for his summer vacation
independent research.

70
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,822
The Pervy Sage?

71
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,449
Yes...

72
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,745
Are you an idiot?

73
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,956
Do you seriously think
there's an Onbaa?

74
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,668
Well, you'll get yours when
you see my independent research!

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,003
Who would?

76
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:21,590
Even if there were an Onbaa,
it wouldn't deal with you...

77
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,093
You said it! Flat-chested girl!

78
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,011
Who's flat-chested?!

79
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,846
No way is there such a thing
as an Onbaa!

80
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,515
You wanna bet on that?

81
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,849
Yeah! I'll bet!

82
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,811
Then, I'll bet on Jiraiya.

83
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,270
Huh?!

84
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,485
Then, I'm off to wrestle
with an Onbaa!

85
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,864
And? Did the Pervy Sage
meet an Onbaa?

86
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,908
When he came back three days later,

87
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,828
he said he won with
a force-out move...

88
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,454
which most likely was a lie.

89
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,670
Oh! here it is.

90
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,758
Huh? What's this?

91
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,637
What lousy writing!

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,014
You're one to talk, Naruto.

93
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,435
Let's see... The Onbaa is big.
It is nine-feet tall.

94
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,229
The Onbaa is scary.

95
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,148
No one is a match for it
when it gets mad.

96
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,191
But I beat it at wrestling.

97
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,486
What's this?

98
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,780
The Onbaa's child likes
being carried piggyback.

99
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,366
They grow up on the parent's back.
What?!

100
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,290
What Jiraiya wrote is bogus,
tracing the legend as is, but...

101
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,625
So there was an Onbaa...

102
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,919
Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,

103
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,213
it stays piggyback on my back
and won't get off.

104
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,048
What should I do?

105
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,761
According to legend,
the child Onbaa considers

106
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,015
the first thing it sees after birth
as its parent

107
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,017
and clings to the back
of that person.

108
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,061
It seems they grow that way,
piggybacked on the parent,

109
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,229
until they become an adult.

110
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,358
It seems until then,
they never leave the parent's back.

111
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,571
Then, there's no other way
but to wait until it grows up.

112
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,282
You say that, but when it grows up...

113
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,785
it'll turn into a scary
nine-foot tall monster, right?

114
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,708
What's up with
that straightforward reaction?

115
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,420
Well, it's a legend,
so it'll probably get off eventually...

116
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,881
Don't be so irresponsible!

117
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,058
H-Hang in there, Naruto...

118
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,268
We'll be cheering you on
from behind the scenes.

119
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,271
Come up close rather than
behind the scene, damn it!

120
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,735
What is it?

121
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,278
I won't lose, you know!

122
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,239
This isn't a weight, man!

123
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,512
What is it, Hinata?

124
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,057
Naruto... I heard a strange rumor.

125
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,268
A strange rumor...you say?

126
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,772
That you...umm...had a child.

127
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,316
Oh. You mean this?

128
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,364
Huh?! Hinata!

129
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,367
Hey! You okay?! Hinata!

130
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,452
Hinata, Hinata!

131
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:46,878
Hinata?!

132
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,189
What's the deal?
You're sure an extravagant guy...

133
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,192
Oh!

134
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,705
Am I going to have to take a bath
every time he pees on me?

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,002
Ichiraku Ramen

136
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,426
You know, we don't allow pets.

137
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,803
The Leaf Village public health
department is strict, you see.

138
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,681
I missed dinner because of him.

139
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,308
Overlook it just for today.

140
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,810
But now that I look closer,
he's cute, isn't he?

141
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,480
So, what's his name?

142
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,444
He's saying it himself,
so I guess Onbu is okay.

143
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,404
Onbu, huh...?

144
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,710
Doesn't he want to eat
some Naruto fish cake?

145
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,091
Here.

146
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,263
Old man!
Give me a whole roll of Naruto!

147
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,348
Coming right up!

148
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,173
Ever since you clung to my back,

149
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,926
I've been getting nothing
but odd jobs like this.

150
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,803
Well, I guess it can't be helped...

151
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,184
He's gotten big...! And so quickly...

152
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,606
This is bad!

153
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,662
Naruto Uzumaki,
you are assigned a mission

154
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,999
for the removal of the mountain bandits
from Yamabuki Pass!

155
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,543
Removal? Hey old lady...

156
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,128
Onbu's gotten big,

157
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,880
so you intend to get rid
of the troublemaker, right?

158
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,090
N-No, it's not like that.

159
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,220
I was thinking you've had
some eye-opening growth recently, so.

160
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,181
Then, what about the other members?

161
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,143
No... Since you've shown
such remarkable growth,

162
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,645
a solo infiltration should be fine.

163
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,108
Sure enough,
it's getting rid of the troublemaker!

164
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,120
This is also fate...
Okay now, back to work.

165
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,262
Thanks, mister!

166
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,693
N-Naruto, Naruto.

167
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,821
Things are fun when
you're around, Onbu!

168
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,826
That Grandma Tsunade.

169
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,330
Don't think you were able to
get rid of the troublemaker so easily.

170
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,375
I'll beat the mountain bandits
and finish up this mission lickety-split

171
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,670
and the two of us will return
to the Leaf Village with pride!

172
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,255
Right, Onbu?!

173
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,640
Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!

174
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,603
Who're you, creep?!

175
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,729
Who're you?!

176
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,106
What do you want?!

177
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,067
I'm Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!

178
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,360
Prepare yourselves!

179
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,362
– Say what?!
– Get him!

180
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,782
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
184.01

181
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,498
Onbu!

182
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,670
Even knowing it's a clone...

183
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,840
I won't forgive those who hurt Onbu!

184
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,436
Heh! How was that?!

185
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,396
Die!

186
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,485
Onbu! You saved me!

187
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,410
Onbu... I owe you my life.

188
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,630
Let's get back to the village quick
and surprise everyone!

189
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:27,969
Onbu! No way will I believe that
you're a dangerous creature!

190
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:32,766
We'll go as the Onbu-Naruto team
succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!

191
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,148
What was that?

192
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,193
It's okay...

193
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,153
You've got me with you.

194
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,373
Onbu?! No, it's huge!

195
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,096
Could it be...you're after Onbu?

196
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,972
Are you Onbu's mom?!

197
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,644
W-W-W-Wait! I didn't steal him!

198
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,855
Onbu! Say something, will you?!

199
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,318
Y-You idiot, Onbu!

200
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,906
No, y- you've got the wrong idea!

201
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,492
Onbu, it's your mom.

202
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,664
It's not my intention!

203
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,236
Damn it! I had a rough time of it.

204
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,198
If you're a mother, then take better care
of your child, really!

205
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,246
It's okay! I'll return Onbu to you!
So rest easy.

206
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,707
Huh? My body got light.

207
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:33,052
Huh? Onbu? You got so big!

208
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,642
Huh, wha...?
What's the matter, Onbu?!

209
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,690
What's the deal?!

210
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,754
W-W-W-Wait... Onbu, it's me!
Can't you tell?!

211
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,173
We were getting along
so well just a moment ago!

212
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,178
Please remember me!

213
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,847
It's me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!

214
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,390
Oh, yeah! Naruto!

215
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,768
Naruto! Naruto!

216
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,144
Onbu, look at this!

217
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,565
Remember!
Remember this spiral!

218
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,445
Naruto, Naruto!

219
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,162
You remember my back you clung to
the whole time, don't you?

220
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,633
Have I...had it?

221
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,107
Onbu...

222
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,572
I'm tired...

223
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,333
This feels kind of good...

224
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,461
It's like I'm being carried piggyback.

225
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,218
Onbu...

226
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,282
Onbu!

227
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,830
Live in good health with your mom.

228
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,085
All right!

229
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,636
My sides...are splitting!

230
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,099
Onbaa is now no longer a legend.

231
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,603
They're thriving in the village forest
and seriously proliferating.

232
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,731
The stupid eagles carried them in, so.

233
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,279
Naruto! How'd you tear it off you?!
Tell me!

234
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,492
Who knows?
All I did was wrestle with Onbu.

235
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,243
Don't be so mean!

236
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,704
At this rate,
the village will be crushed.

237
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,510
Tell me! Naruto!

238
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,679
Don't look at me.

239
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:16,609
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

240
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:23,449
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

241
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,965
Yellow Moon.

242
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:45,638
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

243
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:50,852
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

244
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:57,734
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

245
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:04,741
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

246
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:11,289
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

247
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:18,212
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

248
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:25,053
A magical chord change, in a restless city

249
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:31,934
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

250
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,524
Shino and I have been
sent to a certain village to deal with

251
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,527
a dispute over a family head
who passed away.

252
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,989
An old woman suddenly appears
on the road and says this to us.

253
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,533
"Even dead men laugh
in Motoyoshi Village."

254
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,410
They were mysterious words.

255
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,205
I never imagined it at this time.

256
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,916
To think I would see with
my own eyes,

257
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,543
a sight in this village too frightening
to even talk about...

258
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,587
Next: "Laughing Shino."

259
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,506
I can't even go to the bathroom
alone at night.
