1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,104
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,400
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,904
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,539
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,545
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,258
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,720
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,016
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,644
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,238
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,784
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,881
and melting away

17
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,277
It's close.

18
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,707
That's strange.

19
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,211
There hasn't been even
one trap set for a while...

20
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,339
Shikamaru, what do you think?

21
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,510
We're being underestimated.

22
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,974
Those guys think the only one
following them is that big guy.

23
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,811
They don't need to set
a trap on their man.

24
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,147
How dare they underestimate us!

25
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,942
It seems you're right.

26
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,863
We are being
completely underestimated.

27
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,908
However, this is our chance.

28
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah... We'll take them by surprise.

29
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,965
Your Opponent is Me!

30
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,857
That Jirobo is late.

31
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,902
No, he's already here.

32
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,952
Aw, c'mon, what took you so long?

33
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,913
Sorry.

34
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,417
It took time to eat the scums' Chakra.

35
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,380
Hey fatso, don't you dare drag!

36
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,634
Hurry up and carry that coffin...

37
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,971
That's your job, you vulgar swine.

38
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,056
I know.

39
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:51,231
What, Jirobo...
You're awfully easygoing today.

40
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,567
What do you mean?

41
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,656
I'm just saying I'm not handing you
the coffin.

42
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,241
Because you're not Jirobo!

43
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,627
This time let me do it.

44
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,880
Sakon, Tayuya, you guys go ahead!

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,516
Jirobo always corrects
Tayuya's choice of words.

46
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,605
I see.

47
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,984
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net.

48
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,745
You!

49
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,461
Ninja Art: Spiral Spider Web

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,427
Naruto!

51
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,971
Now Kiba, Akamaru!

52
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,349
He shouldn't be able to
move in mid-air.

53
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,269
Fang Over Fang!

54
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,569
I won't let you get away!

55
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,323
That's my line.

56
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,409
Look at your feet.

57
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,955
You!

58
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,916
It's too soon for you to think
you captured us with a thing like this!

59
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,879
Shut up!

60
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,343
C'mon, what the hell is
that fatso doing, dammit!

61
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:48,682
It was a mistake to leave
behind the weakest of us, after all.

62
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,196
Got it.

63
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,123
-Neji!
-What?!

64
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,419
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji...

65
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,755
Even though we've followed the plan,
it's no good.

66
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm going to cocoon you.

67
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,614
Damn!

68
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,329
Damn it! Damn it!

69
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,499
What's with this thread?! It won't cut.

70
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,214
It's useless.

71
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,968
My thread is so strong that
even if two elephants pulled away,

72
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,761
it wouldn't break.

73
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,434
Shadow Clone... Interesting.

74
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,490
The thread is sticking...

75
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,660
This stickiness is probably made

76
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,372
by mixing Chakra with
his special body fluid.

77
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,418
Moreover, this strength. Even after
it's been released from his hands...

78
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,338
Chakra's continuously flowing
in the thread.

79
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:50,762
It's impossible...
The level of the Jutsu is unrealistic.

80
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,350
Calm down... Just calm down...

81
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,520
my Chakra.

82
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,580
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread.

83
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,751
It's a different color than
the thread from before.

84
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,711
What's he gonna do?

85
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,766
It's quickly solidifying, huh...

86
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,355
You are the first one,
so it's like a little entertainment.

87
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,859
Now I'll play a game to see
which of you is the real one.

88
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,361
What did you say?!

89
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,658
First is...you at the end.

90
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,869
Naruto!

91
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,292
It was a clone, huh.
Well, this one next!

92
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,300
What a lucky guy.

93
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,930
Next, I'll do two at a time.
The odds are 2 to 1.

94
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,659
This guy has a great luck,
but it's either one or the other now!

95
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,632
Turns out he made it to the last.

96
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:57,639
Well, it was fun as a game,
but now the game's over.

97
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,061
Die!

98
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,317
The first one is done.

99
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,361
What?!

100
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,129
I see, the real body made
its shadow clones get caught,

101
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,591
and hid himself and
waited for a chance, huh.

102
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,679
For a small fish like that to make
such a plan in those circumstances...

103
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,641
You're not too bad...but ...

104
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,107
You're at the end of the line. Die!

105
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,112
What?!

106
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,532
Naruto, your stall was helpful.

107
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,658
Neji!

108
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,039
You... How...?!

109
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,795
Substance with Chakra base...

110
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,090
It's meaningless in front
of Gentle Fist

111
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,550
that destroys by pouring
Chakra through.

112
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,303
That guy's Jutsu...

113
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,934
Evidently I'm the only one
who can fight it.

114
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,270
Go!

115
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,107
I'll take care of this.

116
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,879
What's wrong? Hey, Akamaru.

117
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,175
Apparently, this guy's stronger
than the fatso before.

118
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,345
Quite a bit stronger.

119
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,937
If we're not prepared for
"one person, one kill,"

120
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,480
then it's not going to work out.

121
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,150
That's what you said earlier.

122
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,237
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:22,826
Plus, we won't be able to catch up
with Sasuke if we stall here.

124
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,953
Choji hasn't come back either.

125
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,628
The reason we're doing this

126
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,089
is because of the mission
to bring back Sasuke.

127
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,134
But that's not all.

128
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,554
What we are after and trying
to protect is the bond

129
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,807
of the Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

130
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:51,813
Do you remember Iruka's words

131
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,190
at the Third Hokage's funeral?

132
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,698
Iruka Sensei,

133
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,205
why do people risk
their lives for others?

134
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,462
When someone dies,

135
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:21,176
they depart with their past,
present and future.

136
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,263
Many people die on missions
or at war.

137
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,142
And their death is surprisingly
unceremonious...they simply die.

138
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,896
Hayate was one of those people.

139
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,567
Those who die have dreams
and goals, too...

140
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:43,448
But everyone has things that
are equally important.

141
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,662
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers,
the people of their village,

142
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,164
the people important to you.

143
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,960
The connection to the people
you trust and help mutually,

144
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,506
the people important to you
from the day you were born.

145
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,679
And the thread that
connects you and your people

146
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,472
gets stronger through time.

147
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,642
It's not a theory.

148
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,063
That's what a person does
as the thread is established

149
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,274
because they're important to you...

150
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:29,244
Look, Sasuke is heading
towards Orochimaru.

151
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,956
We can't let Orochimaru get
a hold of someone from our village.

152
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,500
Absolutely not.

153
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,587
And...

154
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,019
Naruto...

155
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,190
Your eyes are better than mine.

156
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,865
Right now, Sasuke is...

157
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,995
in the darkness.

158
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,635
Hurry up and go!
I'll catch up with you all!

159
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,138
Gotcha!

160
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,309
Okay! Let's go!

161
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,063
You along with Choji,
be sure to catch up!

162
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,523
Yeah...

163
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,164
Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!

164
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,171
think I'll let them get away?!

165
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,841
Byakugan!

166
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,058
Here it comes!

167
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,447
This guy's pretty good...

168
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,369
Neji!

169
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,620
That's Neji all right!

170
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,544
Not yet...
I won't let you escape that easily!

171
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,716
I won't let you go any further from here!

172
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,222
It's useless.

173
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,769
Well, that's fine.

174
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:04,232
It seems you're the strongest
out of the lot.

175
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:11,156
Aw man, now I wanna play...

176
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,577
It's such a waste if
a game isn't played little by little.

177
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,603
For starters,
I'll play and kill you in three minutes.

178
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,040
I got you.

179
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:54,717
You're pretty good at handling Chakra
and you've got sharp eyes.

180
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,596
You release Chakra from
the Chakra points in your hands

181
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,598
like a sharp needle.

182
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:05,436
You see the thin part of the thread
with Chakra running through it, and attack.

183
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,235
I see, I've heard from Lord Orochimaru...

184
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,737
This is what's called Gentle Fist, isn't it?

185
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,577
But if you can't use
those annoying hands,

186
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,996
they can't cut my threads either.

187
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,837
Man, games. The instant you know
the rules of engagement,

188
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,339
they're no longer interesting.

189
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,469
It's only been a minute,
but I'm already tired of you.

190
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,279
Die!

191
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,160
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread

192
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,470
What?!

193
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,816
How did he...?!

194
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,278
I'll explain, specially to you.

195
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,323
It's not just my hands

196
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,953
I can release Chakra from
all of the Chakra points on my body.

197
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,667
And it's game over.

198
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,842
Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.

199
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,817
Once in a long while,

200
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,487
once in a while

201
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,159
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

202
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:30,373
Look like a mountain

203
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,046
Clinging to the Divine,

204
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,800
clinging to Buddha

205
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:46,556
The remnants of a person crying

206
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,309
Look like a mountain

207
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,981
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

208
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,152
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

209
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,113
Shake shake shake
Let's look

210
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,367
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

211
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,631
Look like a mountain

212
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,095
Look like a mountain

213
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,599
Look like a mountain

214
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,603
Look like a mountain

215
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,651
The attack on his Chakra points
is ineffective.

216
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:41,819
On top of that,

217
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:45,114
he switched to a long-distance attack
to avoid Gentle Fist.

218
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,827
This guy blocks my every move
and he quickly reads my hands.

219
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:53,831
This is bad. I'm at a disadvantage
if the fight drags on.

220
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,001
And if he noticed that, then...

221
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,506
Next time: "360 Degrees of Vision:
The Byakugan's Blind Spot!"
