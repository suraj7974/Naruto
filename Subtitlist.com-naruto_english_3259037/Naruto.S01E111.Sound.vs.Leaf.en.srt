1
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,563
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,816
I just want to convey

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,243
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,627
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:51,343
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you,

8
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,845
right?

9
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,224
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,644
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,356
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,067
In time,

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:12,323
we'll realize that it was everything

14
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:18,579
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,540
Trembling thoughts

16
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:28,631
swept into a vortex and melting away

17
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,982
Sasuke!

18
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,667
It will be necessary for you to die once...

19
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,462
Die once, you said?

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,140
Mind Awakening Pill.

21
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,060
You will take these.

22
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,314
Mind Awakening Pill...? What is that?

23
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,860
Your Curse Mark level is
at the first state...

24
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,778
These pills will forcibly stimulate

25
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,698
the power of the Curse Marks
to the second state.

26
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,078
However, if you move up
to the second state,

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,915
the Curse Mark's erosion
will accelerate drastically

28
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,543
and if things are left that way
you will die immediately!

29
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,212
However...

30
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,966
In order to control
the power of the second state,

31
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,968
it is necessary to allow one's body
to get accustomed to it

32
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,220
over the course of several hours.

33
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,059
In doing so, you will...

34
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:09,023
attain power that is
equal to ours, however...

35
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,694
Once awake, you can't possibly
last more than a few minutes...

36
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,988
and will certainly die!

37
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:22,703
Sound vs. Leaf

38
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,764
Die...and what will happen after that?

39
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,558
You don't need to worry.

40
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,937
That's why we're here.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,073
We will use Barrier Ninjutsu
to suppress the side effects.

42
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,574
We will mitigate that phase

43
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,078
to ease you from eternal death
to a state of half death.

44
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:12,628
You really think I can put my faith
in your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?

45
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,089
Master Sasuke...

46
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,885
We normally function
as Lord Orochimaru's bodyguards!

47
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,554
We know our stuff when it comes
to Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,

48
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,140
Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!

49
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:43,993
I absolutely cannot die yet!

50
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,831
I'm counting on you.

51
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,524
Hey!

52
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,569
We're gonna lose him if you guys are slow!

53
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,792
Get into position!

54
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,045
Begin!

55
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,527
-Four Black Mists Formation!
-Four Black Mists Formation!

56
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,172
Black Seal!

57
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,304
All right. We're done for now.

58
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,149
Man, I'm exhausted.

59
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,069
I didn't think this mission
would drag on this long.

60
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,705
I'll go check out the situation.
Let's go, Raido!

61
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,873
Right.

62
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,218
Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.

63
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,636
There's one...

64
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,680
No, two of them.

65
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,474
Here they come!

66
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,572
You guys are Orochimaru's...

67
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,365
Judging from the direction you came from,

68
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,035
it appears that you are on your way back
from the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

69
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,420
What's in that barrel?

70
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,881
Having two Jonin as opponents...

71
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,217
That's a tough one.

72
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,969
Every one of them got the Curse Marks...

73
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,680
You refuse to answer?

74
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,892
This will be different from that time before
with your surprise attack.

75
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,270
Shut up, you scum! Just drop dead!

76
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,316
Orochimaru's toys...

77
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,861
Don't you dare monkey around
with Leaf Shinobi!

78
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,466
Those two are really late, aren't they?

79
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,803
What should we do, Shizune?

80
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,014
-Let's go see!
-Right!

81
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,732
Shikamaru!

82
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,818
What's the matter?

83
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,530
There's a smell of blood nearby.

84
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,753
Wh-What's this?!

85
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,602
Raido! Genma!

86
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,281
This isn't good!

87
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,917
I can't believe these two
could have been taken down...!

88
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,437
The best I can do right now is
give him some stop-gap treatment...

89
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,813
Shizune...

90
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,484
I'm gonna hunt those guys down!

91
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,860
No!

92
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,779
B-But...

93
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,240
W-Wait...Iwashi.

94
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:04,331
Th-The Jutsu that those guys have
is no longer that of mere Shinobi...

95
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,003
If you pursue them alone, you'll only die.

96
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,924
Genma...don't talk anymore!

97
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:29,481
The smell of the other two impinged
on the five others including Sasuke...

98
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,901
But the five are moving away
from the smell of the blood!

99
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,069
What should we do?!

100
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,573
Just as I thought. He has guides.

101
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,701
This has really turned into
a real pain in the neck.

102
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,454
Let's hurry up and pursue Sasuke!

103
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,665
Shut up, Naruto!

104
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,669
That's for Shikamaru to decide!
Don't play the boss!

105
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,630
Shikamaru?

106
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,300
The fact that there was
the smell of blood probably means

107
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,636
that a battle occurred somewhere.

108
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,099
If we go to that location we should
be able to gather some information...

109
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,895
We must be attentive
as we near the location,

110
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,772
so we would have to switch over to

111
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,275
a reconnaissance pattern
and approach walking slowly...

112
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,194
While all that's going on

113
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,321
Sasuke will cross over
the Land of Fire border!

114
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,199
What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!

115
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,749
All right! Let's pursue Sasuke!

116
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,085
All right! That's what I was waiting for!

117
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:33,879
However...

118
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:41,636
The fact that there was a battle
means they'll have their guard up.

119
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,721
They'll certainly be aware

120
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,056
of the fact that there might
be Ninja on their tail.

121
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,101
In other words,

122
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,979
the odds are high that
there will be traps or an ambush.

123
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,483
Listen carefully...

124
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,319
Hereafter, I want you to use your visual
and acoustic senses to the fullest!

125
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,740
We need to locate those guys before
we get caught in an ambush!

126
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,910
And if we come across anything suspicious,

127
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,371
don't just dodge them, interpret them!

128
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,081
All right!

129
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,835
When we find them, I'm gonna
use my new Jutsu to clobber them!

130
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,171
That Naruto...

131
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,466
Each time I see him
he's added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.

132
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,178
Darn! Just when I thought
I had caught up with him...

133
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,518
Hey! The enemy's smell is everywhere!

134
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,186
Everybody! Stop!

135
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,024
Take a careful look above you.

136
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,112
Paper Bombs...

137
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,448
And in five other places too!

138
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,160
The figuration is that of
a Perimeter Barrier.

139
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,371
Perimeter Barrier...?

140
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,332
It's one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!

141
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,336
Perimeter-type traps have a time lag
and are activated

142
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,882
when one enters the area that
has been marked by the enemy.

143
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,927
It's advanced Jutsu...

144
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,680
It was in one of the books that
my father made me read.

145
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,727
Darn! Our only choice is to make a detour...

146
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,007
Lee... Do what you have to do!

147
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,024
Lee! It's too soon to be doing that!

148
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,026
Lady Fifth Hokage!

149
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,653
I already know that
you're a foolhardy guy.

150
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,490
But you've just had an operation.

151
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,201
You don't need to be rushing into things.

152
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,756
I want to hurry up and
do even a little training.

153
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,467
I also want to... I want to...

154
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,638
Building your strength isn't
the only form of training.

155
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,640
Don't you agree?

156
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,602
It is said that Ninja are those

157
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,813
who can forebear and endure any hardship.

158
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,232
I understand how you feel but...

159
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,611
That means that this too
is one kind of training.

160
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,198
Training...

161
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,327
What if you were to do something foolhardy
and you got worse?

162
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,791
Wh-What's that?

163
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,670
It's medicine that I prepared.

164
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,798
First, drink this and get better!

165
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
Right!

166
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,971
-Come, let's go...
-Yes, ma'am.

167
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,854
Damn! Nothing but traps!

168
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,857
Yeah, but the enemy seems
pressed for time.

169
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,361
The traps have noticeable flaws.

170
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,202
Hey, hey, Naruto!
There's wire at your feet!

171
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,162
Don't trip on it!

172
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,622
I know that already!

173
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,250
Wait, Naruto!

174
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,682
Shadow Possession Jutsu...

175
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,894
M-Made it just in the nick of time.

176
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,898
Naruto! I told you to be careful!

177
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:11,573
I see... One of the wires is
readily visible because it reflects light.

178
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,327
The other wire has been coated
with a matte green.

179
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,372
So it's very difficult to see
with the naked eye.

180
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,041
It's a double trap, huh.

181
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,502
Despite the fact that they're in a hurry,

182
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,213
that's certainly an elaborate trap.

183
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,757
Which means that...

184
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,134
That they're at rest.

185
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,430
Perhaps they got injured,
or that itself could be a trap...

186
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,808
Byakugan!

187
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,735
Caught 'em!

188
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,447
All right! All right!
I'll drag Sasuke back without fail!

189
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,908
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,

190
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,453
but I'm gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!

191
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,121
Me too!

192
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,707
Don't be so hasty.

193
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,126
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy...

194
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,630
we'll make direct contact with the target!

195
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:31,361
Darn! When we're in a hurry,
having to take a darn break...

196
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,197
It can't be helped.

197
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,909
When one fights at the second state,
one's body gets drained drastically.

198
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,413
More than that, it's an ordeal not to
be able to use one's body for a while...

199
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,209
It can't be helped with
two Jonin-class guys as the opponents.

200
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,629
If we act in moderation, we'll be done in.

201
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,845
Kiba...

202
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,096
In that event,

203
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,932
don't mess up the timing
of the Smoke Bombs.

204
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,058
Got it!

205
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,520
Now then we'll split up into two teams.

206
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,856
-Right!
-Okay!

207
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,001
It looks like they haven't noticed us yet.

208
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,255
Hey, Sasuke's not around.

209
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,426
It appears that...

210
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,720
He's inside that "coffin."

211
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,430
Is he dead?!

212
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:27,143
That barrel is secured with Barriers.
I can't see through it.

213
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,271
I wouldn't think that the guys
who wanted Sasuke

214
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,858
would kill him that easily.

215
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,071
You might be right about that.

216
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,733
Once in a long while,

217
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,404
once in a while

218
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:25,243
The remnants of a person broken by dreams

219
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:30,665
Look like a mountain

220
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,963
Clinging to the Divine,

221
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,883
clinging to Buddha

222
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:46,556
The remnants of a person crying

223
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,685
Look like a mountain

224
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,897
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

225
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,193
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

226
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,071
Shake shake shake Let's look

227
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,409
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

228
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:21,090
Look like a mountain

229
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:26,054
Look like a mountain

230
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,390
Look like a mountain

231
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,686
Look like a mountain

232
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,901
Gimme a break, Shikamaru!
You're not reliable in the least!

233
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,403
-And you still call yourself a leader?!
-But this situation sure is a problem.

234
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,655
Leave this kind of thing to me.
It'll be a cinch.

235
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,241
-I sure hope it will be.
-What do you mean by that?!

236
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,868
It's too much of a hassle to explain.

237
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,203
-Shut up, Akamaru!
-Shut up, Akamaru!

238
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,038
What was that?!
Give 'em some more, Akamaru!

239
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,502
Well, if things come to this,
I'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!

240
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,631
Next time: "Squad Mutiny:
Everything Falls Apart!"
