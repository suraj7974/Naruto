1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:17,059
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
One more time

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,022
<=title>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,641
Yes, precious things

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,903
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,711
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,755
One more time

23
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,389
You shouldn't lower your guard, Sensei.

24
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:45,564
I'll bury you and correct
old mistakes, now!

25
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,861
Whatever you do now, it's too late...
I've won...

26
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,530
The Leaf Village will crumble!

27
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,828
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages...

28
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,205
The Third Hokage!

29
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:07,837
Orochimaru! Now I will perform an
ace Jutsu that even you don't know!

30
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,841
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!

31
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,470
Forbidden Secret Technique:
Reaper Death Seal!

32
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,893
A Jutsu I don't know...

33
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,664
Must hurry...
This darkness is dangerous.

34
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,045
I'll have you show it to me.

35
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,225
What's the matter?

36
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,521
Are you planning to be killed
slowly by your predecessors?

37
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,567
Please perform that Jutsu, quick.

38
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,069
Not yet...?

39
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,668
It looks like...I was just in time.

40
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,880
What's the matter?
You're already stumbling...

41
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,262
Now all that's left...
is to catch them!

42
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,231
I got you!

43
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,657
I won't let go!

44
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,367
Appear!

45
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,368
The darkness has disappeared...
What's this Jutsu?

46
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,245
Sarutobi!

47
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,471
I'm sorry...Sarutobi...

48
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,185
We caused you trouble...

49
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,065
Please forgive me...

50
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,775
Lord First Hokage!

51
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,735
Lord Second Hokage!

52
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,783
Seal!

53
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Your own subordinates...!

54
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:50,452
All members in
the Leaf Village are a part of me.

55
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,916
The villagers believe in me,
and I believe in everyone.

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,876
That's what the Hokage is.

57
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:04,716
Saru... Protect those who love
the village and believe in you.

58
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,930
And bring them up as individuals
to whom you can leave the next era.

59
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,392
As of tomorrow, you are the...

60
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,895
Hokage!

61
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,530
Toying with even the lives
of your own subordinates...!

62
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,243
Subordinates' lives?
Stop the endless nonsense!

63
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:36,290
Didn't these kids believed in you?

64
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,754
Come! Enma!

65
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,271
You're mine!

66
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,814
Striking Shadow Snake!

67
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,193
Dang it! You little...!

68
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,780
It's over!

69
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,379
What is this sensation...?

70
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,465
This is bad...

71
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,604
– Die!
– Die!

72
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,377
We have to hold them off here somehow.

73
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,629
Isn't our back-up here yet?!

74
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,426
This is out of our hands!

75
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:22,145
Ninja Art: Summoning!
Bring Down the House Jutsu!

76
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:32,823
This Jutsu...

77
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,788
Long time no see, Ibiki.

78
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,625
Jeez, is that body
the only thing that grew?!

79
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,502
I can't stand to look!

80
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,462
Master Jiraiya...

81
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,465
Jiraiya...! One of Sannin,
the three legendary Shinobi?!

82
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,430
Peeps, open up those little eyes
of yours just this once and observe well.

83
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,020
How wonderful!

84
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:08,233
The devil region beyond heaven
of Jiraiya, the fantastic sage Ninja...

85
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,864
will rage!

86
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,787
Snakes that have been antagonized
by the frog. Begone!

87
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,793
So that Orochimaru has finally started, eh?

88
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,881
Where's the Third Hokage?

89
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,342
The Exam arena.

90
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,261
I see...

91
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,349
Don't die...old man.

92
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,742
Why...didn't you dodge?

93
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,915
Dang it!

94
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,876
The Reaper Death Seal...

95
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,587
In this Sealing Jutsu,

96
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,632
in exchange for the effectiveness
of Jutsu...

97
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,053
one's own soul is handed over
to the Grim Reaper.

98
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,598
It's a Jutsu that costs your life...

99
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,604
My Jutsu doesn't activate...

100
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:14,568
There's no need to dodge.
I will die, anyway.

101
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,699
At the same time the Sealing ends,
my soul will also be devoured.

102
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,703
It's a Jutsu of the hero
who once saved this village.

103
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,999
From now, you will also die...
by this Jutsu!

104
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:34,713
So this Jutsu also sealed
that Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!

105
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:43,555
And now, your soul will be dragged out...
and sealed!

106
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,100
My body...won't listen to what I say!

107
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,275
You'll probably be able to see it soon.

108
00:12:55,859 --> 00:13:01,239
Your soul is also already
about halfway out, so.

109
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,244
Those who have their souls sealed
by this Jutsu

110
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,539
will suffer inside the belly
of the Grim Reaper for eternity

111
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,751
and will never attain peace...

112
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,633
Those who seal and are sealed
have their souls intertwined,

113
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:24,763
and will hate each other,
and continue to battle for eternity!

114
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,188
What...?!

115
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,467
This is... the Grim Reaper?!

116
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:14,354
Knock it off! You old dotard!
I won't let you do as you like.

117
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,082
Hurry up and...die!

118
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,681
Okay, everyone. Line up!

119
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,146
Quiet, everyone!

120
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,107
Konohamaru!

121
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,944
Konohamaru, it's not going
to collapse, is it?

122
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,363
It'll...it'll be okay.

123
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:12,162
The structure of this face rock path is old,
but is of strong construction.

124
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,999
My grandpa said so before.

125
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,840
So it'll definitely be okay.

126
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,556
Someone's coming!

127
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,308
Which one...?

128
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,103
Uchiha, huh?

129
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,022
Then, what about Temari?

130
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,495
Don't run away like that...

131
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,706
Fine.

132
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,338
I'll be your opponent this time.

133
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,215
Wait!

134
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,718
Temari!

135
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,763
I assumed you'd been
creamed by him.

136
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,723
So you're okay?!

137
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,936
Yeah. Somehow...

138
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,979
But...

139
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,900
it didn't turn out to
be much of a delay.

140
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,904
No, it's time necessary for
Gaara's recovery.

141
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,950
Besides, it'll lead to
his consumption of Chakra.

142
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,347
This is...

143
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,724
Shampoo, again?

144
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,518
No, it's Sasuke.

145
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,733
There are several smells near him.
He caught up...

146
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,694
At last...

147
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,907
Sasuke.

148
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,704
He's totally stopped moving.

149
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,247
Is he going to fight with them?!

150
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,751
Sasuke...

151
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,335
Let's hurry!

152
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:32,177
What's this clump of countless smells
coming from another direction?

153
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:37,140
Hey! There's something besides us
tracking Sasuke!

154
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,933
What?!

155
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,727
An enemy? An ally?!

156
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,730
I don't know. But...

157
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,565
But?

158
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,526
It's not human.

159
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,944
Huh?!

160
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,196
Huh?!

161
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,540
Go! Kankuro! I'll take him again...

162
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,590
Temari, you take Gaara
and go on ahead.

163
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,674
What?

164
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,010
You're at your limit...

165
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,639
I don't need a hindrance.

166
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,641
-But...!
-Go!

167
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,317
Hurry up and go!

168
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,695
Okay...

169
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,201
It can't be helped...
I'll be your opponent!

170
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,122
Humph! I don't care who it is!

171
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,707
No!

172
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,713
Your opponent is me!

173
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,636
You...!

174
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,180
Shino?

175
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,516
Why are you here?!

176
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,731
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena.

177
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,735
The females have almost no smell...

178
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:19,075
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.

179
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,537
Though the male itself
has a strong smell...

180
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,129
Sasuke Uchiha...
You pursue Gaara.

181
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,342
Because the battle between you
and him hasn't been settled yet.

182
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:46,102
I'll fight him, because originally
I was his opponent...

183
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,731
I withdraw!
Please go ahead with the match.

184
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,863
Leave this to me here! Go!

185
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,702
You're very confident.
But are you going to be okay?

186
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,080
No need to worry.

187
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,834
I'll go back you up if
I have just ten minutes.

188
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,713
Humph. By then, I'll be done too.

189
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,728
None of you know anything at all.

190
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:34,776
You guys probably don't know
of the real terror of this world.

191
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:43,034
In that case...
you'll teach me that terror?

192
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,704
No...

193
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,668
If you defeat me and chase Gaara,
you'll be forced to know.

194
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,462
That is, only if you can defeat me.

195
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,812
Everyone makes mistakes

196
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,067
It's nothing to be ashamed about

197
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,322
Don't let this scar be for naught

198
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:26,995
Walk with a smile

199
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:42,635
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

200
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:48,057
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

201
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:53,104
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

202
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:58,359
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

203
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:03,489
Everyone makes mistakes

204
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,661
It's nothing to be ashamed about

205
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:14,042
Don't let this scar be for naught

206
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,297
Walk with a smile

207
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,594
Transform sadness into the wind

208
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,849
and continue to forge on

209
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:35,480
Forge on strong

210
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:50,369
You who are strong...
You who are called Uchiha...

211
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,665
You who have friends...
You who have a purpose...

212
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,252
You who are like me...

213
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:03,007
By killing you, I can truly exist!

214
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:10,348
Uchiha, you are my prey!

215
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,893
Next time: "Astonishing Truth!
Gaara's Identity Emerges!"
