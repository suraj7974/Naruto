1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:04,797
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,509
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:17,268
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,645
One more time

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,655
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,829
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,721
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,725
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:08,986
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,282
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

18
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

19
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

20
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

21
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,297
One more time

22
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,643
Where am I?!

23
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,984
I've been saved.

24
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,861
Oh?

25
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,907
Awesome... He's pretty darn big...

26
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,493
Oh yeah...

27
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:13,509
This is a...frog...isn't it...?

28
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,017
Oopsadaisy...

29
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,937
Let's see now...

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
No tail!

31
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,403
This is...!

32
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,363
Not like this one.

33
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,615
Or that one.

34
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,284
It's really...

35
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,537
A real... Frog!

36
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,084
He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks!
Chief Toad Appears!

37
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,715
Looks like he extracted the
Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox

38
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,009
all on his own this time.

39
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,346
But still, one certainly can't
say he's stable yet...

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,349
He overused the large Charka...

41
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,770
To think that of all the frogs
he summoned that one...

42
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,524
I did it...

43
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,484
Hey, you little brat!
Huh?

44
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,237
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

45
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,620
You little brat...

46
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,624
On whose head do you think
you're raising a ruckus!

47
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:32,755
This is the top of Gamabunta,
the Chief Toad's head! You idiot!

48
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,965
Quiet down...

49
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,676
Oh!

50
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,102
W-What the heck is this guy?!

51
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,812
He seems pretty awesome, but...

52
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,439
Gimme a break!

53
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,692
Just when I'm breathing the air of
the free world after a long time,

54
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:57,321
some weird kid is raising
a ruckus on top of my head.

55
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,742
Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!

56
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,412
What the heck do you think you're doing?!

57
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,625
Hmm... This doesn't look good...

58
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,629
'Cause even I can't handle that Gamabunta...

59
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,591
Jiraiya! Hurry up and
show yourself, you idiot!

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,763
Hmmm...It would be troublesome if
that Gama found me out...

61
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,890
I better get my ass out of here
without any further delay.

62
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,643
Hey, little brat!

63
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,852
Y-Yes...?

64
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,438
Where's Jiraiya?

65
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,483
Huh...? Jiraiya...?
Who's that...?

66
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:39,154
I'm talking about that lecher who
calls himself Toad Sage or something!

67
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,157
Where's Jiraiya? Huh?!

68
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,661
S-Scary...

69
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,664
If you just follow my orders,

70
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,500
I wouldn't mind making you my henchman!

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,211
Hurry up and answer me!

72
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,797
Okay! If you're talking about
the Pervy Sage,

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,591
he's on the cliff up there, Chief Toad.

74
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,093
Up there, huh...?

75
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,596
Um... Can I ask you one question?

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,098
What is it?

77
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,727
What business do you have
with that Pervy Sage?

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,564
That's the question I want
to ask that pervert!

79
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:19,486
What the heck does he want
summoning me to a place like this?!

80
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,113
B-But...

81
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,573
What is it?

82
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,910
I'm the one who summoned you, Chief Toad..

83
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,078
I fell off the cliff...

84
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,040
and thought maybe you
could come to my aid...

85
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,541
Please...

86
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,752
Hmm...?

87
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,931
What does a kid like you think
he's saying out of the blue.

88
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:54,855
There's no way a little squirt like
you could summon a guy like me.

89
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,400
It's...it's true...
I really truly summoned you...

90
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,860
Believe it!

91
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,370
You jerk frog!

92
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,455
Huh...?

93
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,290
You've been condescending to me

94
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,709
and saying whatever you
please since earlier on!

95
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:21,757
Since I summoned you, I'm your master!

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,177
Huh...? What was that?

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,639
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?!

98
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,890
A little squirt like you,

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,726
who isn't even able to exchange cups
of sake as a pledge of friendship,

100
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,521
is saying to Lord Gamabunta,
that you're his master?

101
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,483
I could kill you for that! Hey!

102
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,068
Huh...

103
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,998
Oohhh...

104
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:16,353
It looks like he emerged on top,
that Gamabunta...

105
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,654
Awesome...

106
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,994
I hate to tell you this, little brat,

107
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,745
but even if I were to concede
a hundred steps to you...

108
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,497
No, concede a thousand steps to you,

109
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,042
and even if it really was true that
it was you who summoned me...

110
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,129
If you're the kind of guy who
falls off my back that easily,

111
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,091
there's no way I could
admit you as my master...

112
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,093
Huh?! Huh...?!

113
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,848
Now then...I'm here in the
free world after a long time...

114
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,267
If Jiraiya doesn't have
any business with me,

115
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,729
I think I'll kick back for a while.

116
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,314
Hey! Wait!

117
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,734
Why don't you just go home
and sleep or something?

118
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,779
'Cause it looks like you're incapable
of serving even as my henchman.

119
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,579
Darn it!

120
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,176
W-What the heck do you think
you're doing, you little brat?

121
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,345
If my making you recognize that
I summoned you

122
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,430
depends on my not falling
off your back, then...!

123
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:38,977
Then I won't get off your back
the entire day today no matter what!

124
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,103
What?!

125
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:46,109
And by my doing that I'll make
you recognize me as your master!

126
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:51,823
You little brat! Don't get all carried away
thinking I'll go easy on you!

127
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,577
Huh?!
Fall!

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,543
Chakra adhesion!

129
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,674
There's not enough Chakra!

130
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,426
Listen carefully, Chief Toad!

131
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,513
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

132
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,307
I'm a man who will become Hokage
in the future. Don't forget that!

133
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,601
Who cares!

134
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,236
This is getting pretty interesting.

135
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,487
Hey!

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,366
Oh my gosh!

137
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,040
Sorry Naruto,
but I've gotta get back to work!

138
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,003
Research...research...

139
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,472
Bust off!

140
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,739
Welcome!

141
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,366
I'm gonna eat my fill.

142
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,745
Huh... Those guys are
eathing barbecue again, huh?

143
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,415
A reward for having trained
earnestly...maybe?

144
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,961
I thought you were told not to
let Gaara out of your sight...

145
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,714
Don't worry... even somebody like him...

146
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,676
wouldn't dare to do anything
in broad daylight.

147
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,180
More importantly,
that guy Shikamaru or whatever,

148
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,974
he's the first guy you're fighting, right?

149
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,393
Shouldn't you be formulating
a battle plan?

150
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,981
Humph... There's no way I would
lose to a guy of that level...

151
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,066
Besides...

152
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,317
You botched it, didn't you?

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,401
Huh?

154
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,529
If you had taken the exam
one year earlier,

155
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,115
you would have made the Chunin easily...

156
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,701
Don't say it...

157
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,875
What was that?!

158
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,586
The upcoming Chunin Exam...

159
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,840
I'll have the three of you from
our Sand Village take the exam...

160
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:18,428
But the reason for doing that
is not to pass the Chunin Exam!

161
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,056
It is to use the opportunity
of the Chunin Exam...

162
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,809
to crush Leaf Village!

163
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:30,190
But why...? Don't we have
a treaty with Leaf Village?!

164
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,778
That treaty is the problem.

165
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,780
Oh.
What do you mean?

166
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:41,034
You Genin are not aware of the detail but...

167
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,120
At the time the treaty was concluded,

168
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,374
that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind
not only aggressively scaled down

169
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,211
the arsenal of the Hidden Sand Village...

170
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,712
he delegated to the Leaf Village

171
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,257
matters that should have been handled
by our country, and moreover,

172
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,763
significantly cut our country's budget
and slashed the number of Shinobi.

173
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,723
When we have an idiot leader,

174
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,184
we, the arms and legs
of the country, suffer.

175
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,895
The only choice we had left
was to improve the quality

176
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,732
of each and every Shinobi in order
to maintain our country's military power...

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,654
That's why Shinobi like you were created...

178
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,948
Gaara...

179
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,163
The Land of Wind's security is
in extreme danger right now!

180
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,876
But the aides of that idiot feudal lord...

181
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,128
don't have a clue!

182
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,380
Lord Kazekage ,

183
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,801
who detected the weakening in the military
strength of the Hidden Sand Village,

184
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,845
joined hands with the Hidden Sound Village

185
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,848
and decided to take down
the Hidden Leaf Village...

186
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,518
In addition to restoring Sand
Village authority...

187
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,896
this needs to be done in order
to make that idiot feudal lord

188
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,356
aware of the importance of
crisis preparedness...

189
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,821
If any more time passes,
our Sand Village will totally lose

190
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,950
its military capabilities
against the Leaf Village ...

191
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,911
Now is the only chance ...

192
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:11,374
The success of that mission...
Gaara...depends on your work...

193
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,253
Yeah...

194
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,298
If the strategy is carried out,

195
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,425
it will certainly lead to war
with the Leaf Village.

196
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,970
We'll be at war again...?

197
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,058
The cost to human life in implementing
the treaty was very great...

198
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:33,188
and if it is broken...then again...
many people will die...

199
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,940
H-Hey...Temari...

200
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,693
This is the will of Lord Kazekage.

201
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,655
Of Lord Kazekage?

202
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,866
After all, Shinobi are simply
tools for fighting.

203
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,915
The treaty did nothing more than
jeopardize our very existence.

204
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,795
This is a super A-rank mission.

205
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,838
See it through with great care!

206
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,882
Okay.

207
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,467
Yes...

208
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:10,725
A day sure is long when
one's not doing anything.

209
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,562
I guess...

210
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,380
Darn... What an obstinate little squirt.

211
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:07,657
Goodness...that Naruto seems
like he's in agony...

212
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,245
He must have exhausted most of his Chakra

213
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,957
when he summoned Gamabunta...

214
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,043
Look, look, isn't that pretty...

215
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,587
The rainbow...
Gorgeous...

216
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,299
Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn't it.

217
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,226
Good work, Baki.

218
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,898
Lord Kazekage, I successfully
moved all three pawns

219
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,192
to the real battle as planned.

220
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,155
The agreement with the Sound Village side
has been progressing with no problem too.

221
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,531
Yes, sir.

222
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,618
This is...

223
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,372
A decisive action plan from
the Sound Village.

224
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,514
You still have something you want?

225
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,765
Well...

226
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,975
What is it? Come out with it.

227
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,729
Yes, sir...I was wondering if you
could position some soldiers

228
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,023
near the border on the pretext of
undertaking a tactical exercise.

229
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,483
With only the four of us...

230
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,486
The Leaf Village isn't idiot either.

231
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,947
Their Anbu black ops are moving about.

232
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,034
If we do that, they will see right through
what we're contemplating.

233
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,412
But with only our current
military capability...

234
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,082
That's why I sent Gaara and
the others out there.

235
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:44,671
The restoration of the authority of
the Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.

236
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,133
Well... Go.

237
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,384
Yes, sir.

238
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,273
There's only a little more time remaining
until the sun sets completely...

239
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,733
and if I don't fall off...

240
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,235
I'll be the master!

241
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,695
What's that to me?!

242
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,948
You came up with this
whole thing unilaterally.

243
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,159
I'm not falling off, no matter what!

244
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,373
That Naruto...
he's already way past his limit...

245
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,794
I wouldn't be surprised if
he fell off any minute now...

246
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,927
I could simply ignore what
a brat like him says...

247
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:38,141
but taking a lick really irritates me.

248
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,728
I'm gonna bring this
to an end once and for all...

249
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,190
Hey, brat...what's your name?

250
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,733
Naruto!

251
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,651
It's Naruto Uzumaki!

252
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:53,990
Naruto Uzumaki... Naruto!

253
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,951
Don't hold it against me if you die!

254
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,504
Oh...

255
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,464
That Gamabunta!

256
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,509
Now it's a matter of pride for him, too!

257
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,968
Huh?!

258
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,470
This won't do!

259
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,895
No! This is the sizzling young ladies'
entertainment spot!

260
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:32,821
I'm not falling off when
I'm so close to succeeding!

261
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,364
Hey! Oh...

262
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,032
What?!

263
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,242
That Naruto...

264
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,787
He's squeezing out yet more Chakra
from that condition he's in.

265
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,718
I'm falling...

266
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:22,036
How do you like that, Gamabunta?
I'm still on your back!

267
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,873
It's my victory!

268
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,795
Oh no! If he falls like that he'll die!

269
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,441
Too bad for you... You almost made it.

270
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,908
To think that he could hold out like that
against a tough opponent like Gamabunta...

271
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,758
Hm?!

272
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:23,806
That, Jiraiya, meddling in...

273
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,767
I am fully aware of the fact that...

274
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,978
this guy here summoned me all on his own.

275
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,815
I mean, it's the first time since
the Fourth Hokage

276
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,735
that somebody climbed on my head.

277
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,905
As might be expected,
he must be totally drained.

278
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,951
I don't mind dispensing some
of my power to him but...

279
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,413
Taking him to that place would be best.

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,126
Huh? What!

281
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,358
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

282
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,861
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

283
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,323
Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry

284
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,660
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

285
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:32,041
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

286
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:38,089
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

287
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,924
Fight! Fight! Fight!

288
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:53,187
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

289
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,816
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

290
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,278
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

291
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,531
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

292
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:09,829
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

293
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:15,918
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

294
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,086
Fight! Fight! Fight!

295
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:23,634
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

296
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:29,640
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

297
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,309
Fight! Fight! Fight!

298
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,317
The hospital room where there is no one.

299
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,736
The uninvited visitors...

300
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,074
The childhood phantasms
are repeated in the daydream.

301
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,660
The moment when
the forbidden door is opened...

302
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,249
That guy appears.

303
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:00,046
Next time, "Hospital Besieged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!"

304
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,049
Who is the next victim?!
