1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:04,797
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,426
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,221
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,311
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,651
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,572
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:33,325
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,746
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,624
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,211
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,176
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,637
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,100
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,896
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,566
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,903
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,244
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,005
One more time

23
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,604
So what's up, Temari?

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,027
He's close. He's just right there.

25
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,154
Dang it! What should we do?

26
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,282
Leave it to me.

27
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,776
That was close.

28
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,113
What was that noise?

29
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,367
An explosion...

30
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,704
Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.

31
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,874
I wonder if he's okay.

32
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,293
Don't worry...

33
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,504
He wouldn't get bumped off so easily.

34
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,841
I sure hope so.

35
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,269
Now then, shall we get started?

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,229
Before that,

37
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:11,859
I must have you both
return to your original forms.

38
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,488
Please prepare yourself,
Sarutobi Sensei.

39
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,077
An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!

40
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,998
With every moment,
they are looking more lively...

41
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,876
What is that...Jutsu?

42
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:12,962
Reanimation.

43
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,382
It's a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu

44
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,258
that can bring the dead back to this world.

45
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,429
The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu

46
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,140
is that it uses the blood of the caster.

47
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,976
But I've heard that with this Jutsu,

48
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,853
in order to summon
a dead soul to this world...

49
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,564
the body of a living person

50
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:37,069
is sacrificed
as a container for the soul.

51
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:41,865
Then, the bodies of those two
are of the sacrificed...

52
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,617
Right...

53
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,788
Perhaps dust and dirt cover
the sacrificial body

54
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,376
and take on the original form
of the summoned soul.

55
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,713
And by way of the charm
embedded in the head,

56
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,924
the personality of the soul is killed

57
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,760
and it morphs into no more
than a killing puppet.

58
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,098
They're complete.

59
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,562
They look like how they used
to look more than ever.

60
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,649
Do you know the joy and sense
of accomplishment

61
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,111
of hurting one whom
you once called Sensei?

62
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,405
I prepared this scenario

63
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,367
so that you might know that joy.

64
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,287
So please enjoy it.

65
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,105
Lord Hokage!

66
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,191
Even if the shape and form
are the same...

67
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,818
they're neither the First Hokage

68
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,695
nor the Second!

69
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,157
I...know!

70
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,759
Here I go!

71
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,596
Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.

72
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,122
Water Style: Water Wall.

73
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,422
No way!

74
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,843
To be able to set into motion that level
of Water Style in a place with no water.

75
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,053
I can't believe it.

76
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,605
True to the title of the previous Hokage.

77
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,528
Water Style: Water Shock Wave!

78
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,832
Earth Style: Mud Wall.

79
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,776
Same mighty strength as always.

80
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,831
Having two of you is quite a challenge,
as might be expected...

81
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,374
This is bad.

82
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,377
This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.

83
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,756
Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:

84
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,138
Deep Forest Emergence.

85
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,391
His Chakra became a source for life.

86
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,186
Wow...

87
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,230
So this is the legendary
Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage

88
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,359
who brought turbulent times under control
and built the Leaf Village.

89
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,701
You're finally caught...eh, Sensei.

90
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,342
Okay. Everyone's here, right?

91
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,970
Okay everyone, let's evacuate quickly.

92
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,644
Don't rush and don't panic!

93
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,022
What's the matter, Konohamaru?

94
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,650
Does your stomach hurt or something?

95
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,735
No...

96
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,196
it's not that.

97
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,131
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu.

98
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,092
Appear!
Monkey King Enma.

99
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,901
Humph...

100
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,612
Something pesky has appeared, eh?

101
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,785
Old Monkey Enma.

102
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,506
Orochimaru...
I knew this would happen.

103
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,926
You're pathetic, Sarutobi...

104
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,721
It's because you didn't kill him back then.

105
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,098
I'm going to do it now!

106
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,809
It's too late.

107
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,774
Please...Enma!
The Adamantine Nyoi.

108
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,738
Take care of him.
Don't let him transform into that!

109
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,118
Okay... Got it!

110
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,754
Transform!

111
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,095
All right.

112
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,397
Wow... What level of Ninjutsu battle!

113
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,859
This is Hokage level!

114
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,403
Oh well...

115
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,115
Things have finally gotten interesting.

116
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,880
That's one of his Snake Swords.

117
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,973
Let's do it, Enma!

118
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,517
No matter how strong the body,

119
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,311
the Snake Sword still hurts.

120
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,243
You're mine!

121
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,084
Lord Hokage!

122
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,630
So foolish...

123
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,301
To think you'd strike without even
using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

124
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,470
No, that's not it.

125
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,348
It's not that he didn't use it.
He can't use it.

126
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,976
The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage
has differs from the past.

127
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,147
The Shadow Clone Jutsu that
evenly disperses Chakra,

128
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,566
if things go wrong,
would be like throwing away Chakra.

129
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,695
Sure enough, is it age?!

130
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,120
Are you okay, Sensei?

131
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,666
Please hang in there.

132
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,169
You are called...

133
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,254
"the Professor who knows

134
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,341
and uses all
of the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village," right?

135
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,011
Please don't disappoint me too much.

136
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,685
Please get up, Lord Hokage...!

137
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,187
And please save the Leaf Village!

138
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,022
Lord Hokage!

139
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,195
Fool... It is too late.

140
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,707
Sarutobi, what's wrong?

141
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,210
You're not your usual self.

142
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,504
It's as if you're good for nothing...

143
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,006
What are you hesitating for?

144
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,468
Now's the time to draw the line.

145
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,894
Orochimaru...

146
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,528
You...fool!

147
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,455
Orochimaru...

148
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,249
This is the end.

149
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,252
I'll snap your neck.

150
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,282
As I thought...

151
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,408
It looks like there's no point

152
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,661
if I don't do something
about the soul itself

153
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,539
that is bound by the Reanimation.

154
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,751
If so, all I can do is to use...

155
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,462
the Fourth Hokage's Jutsu.

156
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:58,054
Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,

157
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,932
please forgive me for using that Jutsu!

158
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,561
Sensei...

159
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,147
it seems you're out of breath.

160
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,775
You've gotten old, haven't you?

161
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,863
I've never seen such a pained look.

162
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,327
What's so funny?

163
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,706
It's quite sad...

164
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,961
Old age beats even you,

165
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,297
once renowned as the god of Shinobi.

166
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,639
What's that...?!
What the heck is going on?

167
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,102
Who the heck is that youth?

168
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,398
Who the heck are you?!

169
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,861
Is it so sudden you can't tell?

170
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,114
It's me. Orochimaru.

171
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,701
It can't be...

172
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,079
Have you completed that
Forbidden Jutsu?!

173
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,172
You're a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!

174
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,533
I finally caught up.

175
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,914
This is as far as you guys go.

176
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,290
Dang it!

177
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,502
Sasuke Uchiha.

178
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,965
I won't let you get away now.

179
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

180
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:16,025
It's nothing to be ashamed about

181
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't let this scar be for naught

182
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:26,995
Walk with a smile

183
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,924
Yes, breathe in the air

184
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,593
Lift your face to the sky and jump

185
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,513
If it rains, take a break

186
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,974
Go where the wind takes you

187
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,643
So many regrets

188
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,104
Don't let this scar be for naught

189
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,523
Let's go carve the badges in our chest

190
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,151
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

191
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:03,406
Everyone makes mistakes

192
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:08,661
It's nothing to be ashamed about

193
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:13,958
Don't let this scar be for naught

194
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,213
Walk with a smile

195
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:24,469
Transform sadness into the wind

196
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:29,766
and continue to forge on

197
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:35,646
Forge on strong

198
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,451
Orochimaru...

199
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,828
a genius Ninja who appeared
during the war-torn era

200
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,706
and one of a kind in decades.

201
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,374
I wanted to believe that

202
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,629
this individual
would succeed my strength and will.

203
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,467
But my naiveté created this situation.

204
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,927
I will bury you now

205
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,472
and correct my old mistake.

206
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,476
Next time, "A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!"
