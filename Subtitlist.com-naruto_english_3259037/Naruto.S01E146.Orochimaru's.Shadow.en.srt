1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,683
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,479
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,738
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,420
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,831
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,420
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:35,471
Orochimaru's Shadow

21
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,358
No way... What happened to Iruka Sensei?

22
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,486
Iruka's scent ends right here...

23
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,822
In any case,
all we can do is search for him.

24
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:57,451
Damn it. Where's Iruka Sensei?!

25
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,878
Iruka Sensei!

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,464
What a relief!

27
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,924
You're safe!

28
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,510
Somehow...

29
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,806
Damn...that Mizuki...

30
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,267
Iruka Sensei...

31
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,018
That injury...

32
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,855
Huh, this injury is nothing...

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,191
Iruka Sensei!

34
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,903
I'm all right...
I just had a little rush of pain...

35
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,115
Somebody's approaching!

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,750
What a relief the wound's not deep.

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,211
Yes...

38
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,382
The atmosphere feels kind of heavy...

39
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:58,178
Hmm...There must be something
between those two...

40
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,306
Well, what I think is...

41
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,101
What's up with the paw pad?

42
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,854
Idiot! Look carefully!
The little finger, the little finger!

43
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,941
Little finger? Huh?! Iruka Sensei's?

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,570
Well, my intuition tells me
that it's positive...

45
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,197
Naruto, what are you two talking about?

46
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,783
Uh, nothing!

47
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,203
Huh? Let me make an introduction.

48
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:27,291
This is Tsubaki... Mizuki's fiancée.

49
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,294
Fiancée? Mizuki's...?

50
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,837
Ah, it's negative...

51
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,464
What's up with that reaction?!

52
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,926
Mizuki has caused problems for you again...

53
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,929
I sincerely apologize for that.

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:45,476
So you know about Mizuki's prison break...?

55
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,729
Yes...

56
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,399
He came by my house once...

57
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,987
I became aware of that immediately
and tried to stop him.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,367
But ultimately the result
was that I allowed him to go...

59
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,080
It really couldn't be helped
in light of the situation...

60
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,918
No. I should have tried
even harder to stop him.

61
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,796
But I...

62
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,979
Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!

63
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,524
Please take me with you!

64
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,485
Tsubaki...

65
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,488
I understand that I'm making
an impossible request!

66
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,826
But I want to stop him, no matter what!

67
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,412
Iruka Sensei!

68
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,916
Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,918
In that case...

70
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,463
I'm sorry, but I cannot allow that.

71
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,591
But why...?

72
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,928
Why can't she?!

73
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,683
Naruto, we must hurry up
and search for Mizuki!

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,979
If she's with us,
she'll interfere with our mission!

75
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,440
But... But...!

76
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:19,278
Iruka... If that's the case,
I think I'll be of service to you.

77
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,824
I have an idea of
where he might be heading!

78
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,827
Is that true, Tsubaki?!

79
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,705
There's probably no mistake...

80
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,333
But...
I beg you!

81
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,669
I think it's certain

82
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,338
that he'll use various tricks to camouflage
his tracks as he flees...

83
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,718
If we spend time on that...
it will all be too late!

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,640
Please take me with you!

85
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:13,499
Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23...
Huh, what was the result?

86
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,001
The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage...

87
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,711
Huh?! Who are you!

88
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,845
Dragon, Rooster, Dog...

89
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,199
The lookouts have been taken down!

90
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,617
It's an intruder!

91
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,460
What?!

92
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,963
The Nara Clan's research lab
was attacked?!

93
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,385
Yes... I just received a dispatch
from the Nara Clan...

94
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,345
According to the dispatch,

95
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,598
the insurgent's physical characteristics
match those of Mizuki.

96
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,724
Mizuki's...?

97
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,351
Yes!

98
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,563
What is that Naruto doing?

99
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,526
But it's something to have come up
with the idea of the Nara Clan's institute...

100
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,988
Notwithstanding the abundance of
narcotic substances that are stored there,

101
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,949
due to its remote mountain location,
security is comparatively lax.

102
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,410
And what substances were stolen?

103
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,622
Well... Because of their thorough control
of the substances,

104
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,585
they were able to determine immediately
which substances were taken...

105
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,007
So the description matched after all, huh...

106
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:50,220
But even if a mere Chunin were
to remove those narcotic substances

107
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,972
what would he be able to do with them?

108
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,769
Oh... Thank you. You may go now...

109
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,979
Yes ma'am!

110
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,945
In any case, I can't take any chances...

111
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,782
There's nothing I can do if
I don't know what his objective is.

112
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,328
If I can't discern that from
the actual materials...

113
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,538
there may still be some means...

114
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,458
Perhaps the proportions of the formula,

115
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,668
or possibly the order
in which they're blended...

116
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,134
There's no mistake that
it's this direction, right?

117
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,179
Yes... Please continue to
proceed just like this.

118
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,642
Tsubaki, you said
"It will all be too late."

119
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,810
But do you know what his objective is?

120
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,439
Probably... Although maybe not totally.

121
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,943
Tsubaki, please tell us!

122
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,197
In the past, he told me...

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,868
"I will get my hands on Orochimaru's power
and go to where Orochimaru is."

124
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,578
What was that?!

125
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,209
The reason he stole the Scroll of Sealing

126
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,546
was simply because
he had chosen it as a hospitality gift...

127
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,635
Tsubaki... You knew that?

128
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,221
I didn't convey it to the village...

129
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,308
Just removing the Scroll of Sealing
is a serious felony...

130
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,728
And moreover, I was scared for
what'd happen

131
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,939
if his real objective had come to light...

132
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,652
I believed that he would mend his ways.

133
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,114
In that case you cannot avoid
retribution either.

134
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,865
I am prepared for it.

135
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,159
I thought it was strange...

136
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,121
If you knew where Mizuki was going,

137
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,248
you should have pursued him alone
in the first place.

138
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,917
But you...

139
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,006
I may not be able to stop him alone...

140
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,886
I want to stop him at any cost...

141
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,139
I don't want him to commit
any more crimes.

142
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,100
Unbelievable!

143
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,603
That Orochimaru... So this was his plan!

144
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,110
However, could an ordinary Ninja
really manage to do this...?

145
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,820
It's something only within

146
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,488
the realm of an experienced
artisan's technique...

147
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,534
I'm busy!

148
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,537
I have a progress report on
the inmate prison break incident!

149
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,376
All right... Enter!
Yes, ma'am!

150
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,341
We have just finished
recapturing all inmates

151
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:38,347
with the exception of three –
Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.

152
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,639
Good work...

153
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,268
We are now continuing to investigate
the other three...

154
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:49,024
But, the last inmate we captured said
something that concerned me...

155
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,612
Something that concerned you?

156
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,784
Yes... He apparently saw the three of
them fleeing together...

157
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,329
Fujin and Raijin were fleeing
with Mizuki?!

158
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,997
Damn it!

159
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,251
Lady Tsunade...?

160
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,837
I'm going out!
Where are you going?

161
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,048
There's no need for you to come...

162
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,426
If what he said is true,

163
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,930
the guys I sent out won't be able
to deal with the situation alone...

164
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,861
Hey, Shikamaru...
If things continue like this...

165
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,864
we'll be in trouble!

166
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,158
We're already in trouble...

167
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,079
Shikamaru... All the Chakra is...

168
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,456
I know that...

169
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,918
I've thought of several methods,

170
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,631
but if I let go of these guys we are
gonna find ourselves in trouble...

171
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,341
You insolent jerk!

172
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,926
Having said that,

173
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,761
I can't take them down simply
by catching them,

174
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,555
so that's why I'm doing this...

175
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,265
I won't let you leave here alive!

176
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,185
These guys have monstrous stamina...

177
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,895
And what's more,

178
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,398
although their bodies
look like rubber at first glance,

179
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,692
with that much muscle strength
their instantaneous reflexes

180
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,694
are probably quite something too...

181
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,696
In other words,

182
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,948
you're saying that this is
the only possible method...

183
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,409
Let's do our best, everyone!

184
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,953
Sorry about this...

185
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,315
What do you think, Mizuki?

186
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,196
It's no good...
It's unfortunate but, he can no longer...

187
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,533
I see... All right! Let's withdraw!

188
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,328
Hurry up!
Yeah...

189
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,501
It's unfortunate but...

190
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,295
guys who are of no use on the battleground

191
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,963
only become a ball and chain...

192
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,424
Even though it's just a minor injury,

193
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,218
you won't be able to move
from this place, can you?

194
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,850
Who's that?!

195
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,857
Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!

196
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,276
I saw that...

197
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,658
No way... This can't be, you're...

198
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,535
Orochimaru?!

199
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,872
You are correct...

200
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,917
This can't be... Why are you here?

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,127
Your whereabouts are supposed
to be unknown!

202
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,922
It doesn't matter why...

203
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,715
More importantly,

204
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,635
I witnessed something
very interesting earlier on...

205
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,139
You took the life of
an injured comrade, didn't you?

206
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,475
You saw that...?

207
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,228
That piqued my interest...

208
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,565
That's not a sight one sees
very often among the Leaf Shinobi

209
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,151
who devote their entire time
to playing house in the village...

210
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,404
So what are you trying to say?!

211
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:28,201
I didn't do anything wrong!
I had no choice but to do what I did!

212
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,038
You're a short-tempered child,
aren't you...?

213
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:37,377
I'm not reproaching you.
You were just carrying out your mission.

214
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,130
That's right...

215
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:47,470
But... Is there anybody in
the Leaf Village who acknowledges you?

216
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,229
What did you just do?!

217
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,442
What in the world is this...?

218
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,405
This is my present to you...

219
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,789
Go visit that place if you feel like it.

220
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,128
Here it is...

221
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,863
Looks like there hasn't been
a trespasser here before me...

222
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,205
The eighth one on the right...

223
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,268
What's happening?

224
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,919
What is that power of Orochimaru's anyway?

225
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,964
I don't know either.

226
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,135
And I don't know when
he encountered Orochimaru either...

227
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,889
But I'm positive that the answer to
those questions is waiting just up ahead!

228
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,227
That Scroll of Sealing incident...

229
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,105
You must be angry about it,
aren't you, Naruto?

230
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,983
I don't care about that in
the least anymore...

231
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,738
Because I repaid my debt to that
jerk Mizuki right there and then.

232
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,573
But...
But?

233
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,285
If that guy is still connected
to Orochimaru,

234
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,079
I need to ask him about something!

235
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,042
Because there's someone
I need to find at any cost!

236
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,962
Sasuke...!

237
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,221
It's up there...

238
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,056
All right!

239
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,328
That's everything...

240
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,014
With this all...

241
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,352
This will ...

242
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,939
This will make me perfect!

243
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,028
This place is...

244
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,323
That guy has done something...

245
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,160
That smell gives me the shivers...

246
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,287
Smell?

247
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,125
I was wondering who that was...

248
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,003
You guys are really persistent,
aren't you?

249
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,423
Well, this is very convenient.

250
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,925
Because I was intending to take
you guys down anyway.

251
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,720
Mizuki...

252
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,138
You jerk!

253
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,308
Mizuki... Your ambitions end here!

254
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:48,187
Impudent as always, huh...
However, you're too late!

255
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,939
Just like you always are...

256
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,065
What is that?

257
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,986
Beautiful, don't you think?

258
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,533
Damn it!

259
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:07,957
You guys...should feel honored
to be my first prey...

260
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,218
What?!

261
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,014
That's...almost like...

262
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,936
But that's they way it is,
isn't it, Naruto...?

263
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,699
It's true, you were actually special.

264
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,745
But...

265
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,956
Then that's...

266
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,208
Orochimaru's power!

267
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,964
Mizuki...

268
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:19,320
Crappy news pass us by

269
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,032
And you become speechless

270
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,579
My voice is way too soft

271
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,000
So you don't answer

272
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,547
You're crying Crying alone

273
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,635
What can I do? I'm crying too

274
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,929
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

275
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:50,560
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

276
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,355
Yeah

277
00:21:54,439 --> 00:22:00,111
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

278
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,781
Yeah

279
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:09,537
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

280
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,082
Yeah

281
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:18,921
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

282
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:25,219
Yeah

283
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,734
That's what you meant by
the "invincible body"?

284
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,904
No matter how much strength you gain,

285
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:47,784
the kind of strength dependant
on drugs can never be a true strength!

286
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:53,414
Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says!
Orochimaru's Drug?

287
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:58,294
I'll crush that kind of nonsense,
so be prepared!

288
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,964
Next episode: "A Clash of Fate:
You Can't Bring Me Down!"
