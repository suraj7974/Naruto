1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,254
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,673
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:10,970
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:28,320
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:33,284
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,704
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,623
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:44,628
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:56,015
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:12,656
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,537
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,564
A coup at the Land of Green...?

16
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,067
Yes, it seems there's no mistake.

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,402
The retainers conspired with
some men

18
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,196
and began a rebellion...

19
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,656
What happened to Naruto
and the others?

20
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,950
Speculating from their gathering point,

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,202
they are around here.

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121
So they've already
crossed the border...

23
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,791
The large countries have agreed
to make this

24
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,209
a demilitarized zone.

25
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,336
Considering Naruto and
the other's mission,

26
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,922
they should be in a safe area...

27
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,966
Are you sure?

28
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,218
What do you mean...?

29
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,054
Don't you think the timing
of this request

30
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,974
strangely overlaps with the coup?

31
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,645
Then you're saying that Naruto's mission
is also related to this case?

32
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,397
There is a possibility...

33
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:30,150
But there's no time to deal
with Naruto at the moment.

34
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,321
We have to take back the Land of Green
from the rebels as soon as possible.

35
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,073
If we leave it like this,

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,576
the flames of the war will eventually
reach other countries...

37
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,743
True...

38
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,705
Shizune, gather the free villagers

39
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,498
and have them head to
the Land of Green immediately!

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
Yes, ma'am!

41
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,725
You've done it now!

42
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,685
What a persistent brat...!

43
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,566
You shouldn't be able
to stand anymore...

44
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,026
Naruto!

45
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,529
This is...nothing.

46
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,283
What a surprise...
you got some guts.

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,076
Then, take this too!

48
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,996
Ninja Art Magnet!
Electromagnetic Illusion.

49
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,383
Naruto!

50
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,803
It's useless!
Your voice wouldn't reach him!

51
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,680
The human brain

52
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,766
functions by a faint electric current
running through it...

53
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,060
If you receive
my magnetic force powder,

54
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,687
it's going to alter your electric
current and stop your thinking...

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,653
That chain also has
a strong magnetic force.

56
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,529
Now, get buried!

57
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,825
Naruto!

58
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,960
Are you okay?

59
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,220
Thank goodness...

60
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,431
Hinata...run!

61
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,394
I can't leave you behind...
He is...

62
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,897
He's someone that
you can't deal with...

63
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,528
Naruto... I promise I'll save you!

64
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,363
Hinata!

65
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,578
I'll have you tell me
where that girl is!

66
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,163
Byakugan!

67
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,333
Take this!
Electromagnetic Illusion!

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,421
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

69
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,934
What?!

70
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,740
I see, so that is the Byakugan
of the Village Hidden in Leaves...

71
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,575
How interesting!

72
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,411
What wonderful Taijutsu, but...

73
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,621
I'll crush it
with my power!

74
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,261
I did it...?!

75
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,433
Yeah right...
That level of Taijutsu will not work!

76
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,449
It's useless!

77
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,956
This is bad...!

78
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,559
You're not much of a challenge.
I'm disappointed!

79
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,898
Now tell me!
Where did you hide that girl?

80
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,778
If you answer me, I'll let you live...
That boy too!

81
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,697
If you rescue him right now,
he wouldn't die.

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,702
Run...Hinata...

83
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,412
Now say it!

84
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,000
You don't want to save
that boy?

85
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,046
Or do you think you could win
against me?

86
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,884
If I say it...
Naruto would never forgive me.

87
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,972
Then I'll force you to talk!

88
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,271
I'll change the area behind you
into a powerful magnet.

89
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,066
I can change the position of the magnet
according to your movement.

90
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,651
So it's a waste to run away!

91
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,247
That brat...

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,541
She evaded the attack by throwing
a paper bomb at that very instant.

93
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,501
She's pretty quick witted.

94
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,716
But...

95
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,845
I won't let you go!

96
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,231
Hinata...

97
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,570
Naruto... I promise that
I'll return to rescue you...!

98
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,702
But, there is a huge difference
in power between him and me...

99
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,246
I could never win against him!

100
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,136
He's already caught up to me...
What should I do?

101
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,520
This is...iron sand...?

102
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,110
I see...his Jutsu can
change his body

103
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,862
and the things he touches
into magnet.

104
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,284
The reason why he didn't attack
back there

105
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,411
was to brush off the iron sand
from his body...

106
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:01,083
If he doesn't,
he would sink in his iron sand.

107
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,627
His attack pattern consists of
alternating between

108
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,338
Ninja Art Magnet
and Iron Sand Genjutsu ...

109
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,508
He does this to turn
his magnet powers on and off

110
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,802
so his body won't
completely turn into a magnet.

111
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,431
Then, there is one way
to beat him!

112
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,353
Now...play time is almost over!

113
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,316
Now, it's time you give up!

114
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,278
I would never give up!

115
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,738
Because that is my Ninja Way!

116
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,740
What a waste...

117
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,659
How dare you do that to Naruto!

118
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,203
I will definitely not forgive you!

119
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,956
Once you say where
that girl is,

120
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,125
why don't you live with
that brat in hell!

121
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,969
Hey, don't be shy
and come closer!

122
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,179
Right now!

123
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,307
I'll risk everything
in this single attack!

124
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,237
An attack that didn't work before,
will never work!

125
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,701
Is...that right?

126
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,167
What?!

127
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,591
We're both going to hell!

128
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,892
Let go, you!

129
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,820
You brat! How dare you play
around with me!

130
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,282
I changed my mind.
I'll finish you off now!

131
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,084
What is this?!

132
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,922
Just now...
I struck a Chakra Point

133
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,674
that would make your Chakra flow
go out of control.

134
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,723
Now your body will just turn
into a strong magnet...

135
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,395
What...? That's why you brought me
to this sandy area?!

136
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,980
S-Stop!

137
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,905
I did it...Naruto...

138
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,468
Damn...! I can't move!

139
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,138
The Human Boulder!

140
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,396
Naruto!

141
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,694
Choji...!

142
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,031
Are you okay, Naruto...?

143
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,409
Thanks...Yurinojou.

144
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,661
So what happened?

145
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,707
The second Janin attacked me
and I got beaten up.

146
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,584
What happened to Hinata
and the princess?

147
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,378
Oh yeah...!
I can't stay here!

148
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,881
What...?
What's going on...? Naruto?

149
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,716
Hinata is in danger!

150
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,134
–Oh! Naruto!
–Naruto!

151
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,984
Hinata!

152
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,497
Are you okay...Hinata?

153
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,416
Hang in there, Hinata!

154
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:17,172
N-Naruto... Choji...

155
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,466
Yurinojou...

156
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,846
You guys...
you guys came to rescue me...

157
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,808
Of course...
We're friends, right?!

158
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,061
Yes!

159
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,023
By the way, that magnet guy...
Where did he go?

160
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,485
He probably sunk into the sand...

161
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,072
What?! You did it, Hinata?

162
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,701
Yeah... I did my best...

163
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,079
Hinata, you're great...

164
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,206
The guy that I couldn't handle...

165
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,377
You're complimenting me?

166
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,673
Naruto...
Here...

167
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,008
This is...my forehead band?

168
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,721
The mission is not over yet.

169
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,101
Naruto, please protect the princess...
Princess Haruna.

170
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,561
Hinata...

171
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,983
I'll promise you!

172
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,570
I swear on this forehead band
I will definitely protect the Princess!

173
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,780
And...

174
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,284
I can't be losing against you!

175
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,327
Naruto...

176
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,665
Look after Hinata, Choji...Yurinojou!

177
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,292
Right!

178
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,294
Leave it to us...Naruto!

179
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,223
Well, I'll be darned.

180
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,727
I can't believe that Ruiga
and Jiga were both defeated.

181
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,773
Well, that saves some
trouble though...

182
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,365
Nobody has ever escaped
from my Jutsu.

183
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,869
Today will be a good day.

184
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,708
Haruna! Where are you?!

185
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,886
There she is!

186
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,097
Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!

187
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,436
Are you okay?

188
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,527
I'm glad...

189
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,658
I-It's me, Princess Haruna!

190
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,951
N-Naruto...

191
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,038
I came to rescue you,
but what is this treatment?

192
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,706
Sorry...

193
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,418
Why did you escape by yourself?

194
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,130
I can't count on you guys...

195
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,469
I will try to survive
no matter who's sacrificed...

196
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,015
As long as I survive,
the Land of Green can be revived.

197
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,352
That's the most important thing, right?!

198
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,688
I am a victim!

199
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,692
If I declare that other countries
will lend me their power.

200
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,568
If I take back the country and

201
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,822
I, the true successor,
become the feudal lord,

202
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,657
then people will definitely gather and

203
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,492
the Land of Green will return
to the way it was!

204
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,496
I don't think so.

205
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,958
You're saying that
the Land of Green won't revive?

206
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,419
I'm not saying that...

207
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:48,007
But I just thought what if I lived
in the Land of Green...

208
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,929
If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou...

209
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,396
I won't guard a feudal lord like you!

210
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,857
Naruto!

211
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,193
What do you know?!
What do you know about me?!

212
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:12,115
What do you know about my life
as a hostage?!

213
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,617
Under watch 24/7,

214
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,328
not even allowed to have
my own free time,

215
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,581
I was lonely everyday.

216
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,835
Because of that lifestyle,

217
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,087
I became sick and was
in bed for a long time.

218
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,883
I was finally able to return home
after being close to dying...

219
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,013
Naruto! If you're saying that
I'm wrong, then answer me!

220
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,348
Were the things done to me

221
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,768
in the name of protecting
the Land of Green all wrong?!

222
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:45,315
Then why did my father and mother
send me away as a hostage?!

223
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,943
Answer me! Naruto!

224
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,453
I won't count on you.

225
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,956
I will go by myself.

226
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,502
Wait.
I will go too.

227
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,382
I promised Hinata that I will
definitely protect you, princess!

228
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,637
With Hinata...?

229
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,810
She fought with the second Janin
and got hurt badly...

230
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,144
Hinata did...?

231
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:29,025
You guys said that you didn't accept
the mission of protecting me.

232
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,236
Then, why do you concern yourselves
with me?

233
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,445
I...

234
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,199
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.

235
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:41,079
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad... That's all.

236
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,167
Well, let's go!

237
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,794
If we pass through the valley
ahead of us,

238
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,170
we'll get to the town.

239
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,882
If we do that, they probably won't
chase us all the way there!

240
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,481
Please be careful...

241
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,109
No one uses this deer path.

242
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,319
This should shake them...

243
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,543
I found you!

244
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:33,548
It's impossible...
to run away from me!

245
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,430
Choji?!

246
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,474
Don't make useless efforts...

247
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,394
I'll make you guys my hostages!

248
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,899
You guys take them back to the castle!

249
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,025
Yes!

250
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,737
If you wander around me

251
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,573
you might get caught
in my Jutsu and die.

252
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,219
That's it...
We're almost there!

253
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,144
There's no time to waste!
Let's go!

254
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
Okay!

255
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,398
Haruna!

256
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,442
I'm okay!

257
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,070
Oh no!

258
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,575
Wh-What is this?!

259
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:47,622
I see... You have good sense
to dodge that attack!

260
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,874
Who is it?!
Where are you?!

261
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,877
Here, over here!

262
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:58,299
Too bad, but you guys won't
be able to reach that village.

263
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,302
Since you guys are going
to die here!

264
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:16,401
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

265
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:23,324
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

266
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,673
Yellow Moon.

267
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:45,555
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

268
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,893
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

269
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:57,775
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

270
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:04,824
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

271
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:11,456
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

272
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:18,004
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

273
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,969
A magical chord change, in a restless city

274
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:31,976
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

275
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,192
Damn! He is so troublesome!

276
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,611
How dare he use many
showy attacks.

277
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,238
There is no way I can retaliate!

278
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,824
I've gotta do something.

279
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:52,330
At this rate, I'm gonna get cornered
and shot.

280
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,333
But even if I wanted to hide,
Haruna's legs are...

281
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,584
Oh, damn it!

282
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,253
What in the world should I do?!

283
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:02,715
Next time: "Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!"
