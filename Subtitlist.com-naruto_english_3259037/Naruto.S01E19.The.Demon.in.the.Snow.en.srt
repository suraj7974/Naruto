1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,770
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,995
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,457
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,218
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,016
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,809
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:10,279
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,453
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,584
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,254
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,972
The Demon in the Snow

21
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,937
Gatô, why did you come here?

22
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,525
And who are those henchmen?

23
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,445
Our strategy has changed
a little...

24
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,032
I'm sorry about this Zabuza,

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,618
but you will die here.

26
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,579
What?!

27
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,917
Since hiring a regular Shinobi
costs a lot of money,

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,295
I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.

29
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,880
And, it would have been even
more ideal

30
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,550
to save my money and effort if
Ninja-to-Ninja battles

31
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,552
ended in each killing the other off.

32
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,304
Well, you are certainly not worthy
of being called

33
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,722
the Demon of the Hidden Mist Village.

34
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:24,520
If you were to ask me,
you're just a cute little demon!

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,357
What are those guys?

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,733
So many of them...

37
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,112
Kakashi...I apologize.

38
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,239
Our fight ends here...

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,451
As long as my reason to
take down Tazuna is gone,

40
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,204
there is no reason to fight you either.

41
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,041
Yeah...you are right.

42
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,131
That reminds me...

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,175
I owe him something.

44
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:00,180
He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...

45
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,021
Huh, he's dead.

46
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,397
You bastard!

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,900
What do you think you're doing, hey?!

48
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,402
Stop! Don't act so recklessly...!

49
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:17,948
You say something, too!
He was your comrade, right?

50
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,535
Shut up, punk.
Haku is already dead.

51
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,620
What...?

52
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,915
Don't you feel anything watching
him doing that!

53
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:29,126
Weren't you with Haku for a long time!

54
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,508
As Gatô used me...
I was simply using Haku.

55
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,386
I thought I'd told you...

56
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,681
We Shinobi are merely tools.

57
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,937
What I wanted were his skills
and not Haku himself.

58
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,399
I have no regrets...

59
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:58,072
Do you...
Do you really mean that?

60
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,573
Naruto, stop.

61
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:03,118
There's no need to fight
him anymore... Besides...

62
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:07,081
Shut up!
My enemy is still...this one!

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,711
He...

64
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:16,715
He really liked you!

65
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,386
Is there someone special in your life?

66
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,805
He liked you that much!

67
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:28,394
When a person feels he wants
to protect a person special to him,

68
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,230
that person can truly become strong.

69
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:35,192
Even so,
don't you feel anything at all?!

70
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,697
It's difficult for me to completely
become a Shinobi.

71
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,200
You really...honestly...

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,536
don't feel anything at all?

73
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,331
I'd like to make that person's
dream come true...

74
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,793
For that, I could completely
become a Shinobi.

75
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,255
When a person becomes
as strong as you...

76
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,757
Does that person really
behave like you?

77
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,723
He threw his life away
for you!

78
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,684
I'd like to make that
person's dream come true...

79
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,146
That is my dream.

80
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,108
He didn't even fulfill his
own dreams and yet...

81
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,111
I was happy.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,072
To die as a tool...!

83
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:29,955
That's...
That's...too painful...

84
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,879
Kid...

85
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:57,149
Don't say anything...anymore.

86
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,530
Haku was...

87
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,492
He wasn't just thinking of me.

88
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,327
He was feeling pain inside
for you

89
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,913
while he battled you guys too...

90
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:16,627
I know.
He was too kind...

91
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm glad we could fight with you
at the end.

92
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,552
Huh?

93
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:34,353
Yes, little punk,
it's as you say, after all...

94
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,606
Shinobi are human too...

95
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:42,152
Maybe it's impossible to become
an emotionless tool...

96
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,324
I've lost.

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,913
Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!

98
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,504
Okay...

99
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,432
What?!

100
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,477
Enough! Take them down!

101
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,562
Right!

102
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,481
Are you crazy?

103
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,693
Do you think you can win by yourself
against this many of us?

104
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,768
D-Demon!

105
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:18,665
If you're so anxious
to join your friend...

106
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,294
you go ahead...alone!

107
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,004
Unfortunately...

108
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:30,344
I don't...intend on going...
to the same place...as Haku!

109
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,306
W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...

110
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:41,271
You're going to hell with me!

111
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,441
It's no big deal...

112
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,818
When the Demon of
the Hidden Mists Village

113
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:51,240
dies and goes to hell,
he can become a real demon.

114
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,867
Look forward to it!

115
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,245
I'll let you find out
for sure

116
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,957
if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!

117
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,715
Haku...

118
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:04,980
Now...it's goodbye, Haku...

119
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,359
Thanks for everything...

120
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,571
I'm sorry...

121
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,375
Don't look away.

122
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,755
It's the end for
a man who lived fiercely.

123
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,591
Yup...

124
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,556
Did I...die...?

125
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,600
Sasuke!

126
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,768
Sakura...

127
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,981
Am I...am I...?!

128
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,195
Sakura, you're heavy.

129
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,571
Huh?!

130
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,407
Sasuke...

131
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,459
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!

132
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,836
Sakura...
That hurts...

133
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,548
Things turned out well,
didn't they, Sakura?

134
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,551
Stop, you shouldn't move...!

135
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,429
Anyway, where's Naruto?

136
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,641
And also,
what happened to that mask guy?

137
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,810
Naruto's fine.

138
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:29,022
And...the masked kid,
he died...

139
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,151
Died? Did Naruto get him?

140
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:38,990
Well... I'm not really sure,
but he protected Zabuza...

141
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,703
I had faith in you.

142
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,580
You are awesome, Sasuke!

143
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,624
You avoided getting inflicted with
any mortal wounds!

144
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,629
From the beginning...he intended to...

145
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,506
Naruto!

146
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,590
Sakura...

147
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,094
Sasuke's all right!
He's alive!

148
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,720
Huh?

149
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:17,446
He was feeling pain inside
for you while he battled you guys too...

150
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,240
He was too kind...

151
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,702
I see... He...

152
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,663
So, Sasuke's all right too...

153
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,040
That's a relief...

154
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,127
Hey, hey, hey!

155
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,505
You guys are too relaxed!

156
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,468
Darn Ninja...!
Killing our source of money!

157
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,178
Now that it's come to this,

158
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,554
there's no choice but to attack
the whole town and

159
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,891
take everything valuable!

160
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,602
Shoot, this isn't good!

161
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,061
Kakashi Sensei!

162
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,898
Don't you have a Jutsu
to annihilate them all at once?

163
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,650
That's impossible!
I've used too much Chakra!

164
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,652
Here we go!

165
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,789
Enemies who come any closer
to the island...

166
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,292
With all the might of
all the island's people...

167
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,419
will not be allowed to live!

168
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,712
Yeah!

169
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,130
Inari!

170
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,593
Heroes always arrive
on the scene late!

171
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,847
Inari... You guys...

172
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,940
Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!

173
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,650
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

174
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,449
I can do that even
with my scarce Chakra...

175
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,409
At least, it will bluff...

176
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,245
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

177
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,915
Kakashi Version!

178
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,836
So...are you ready to fight?!

179
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,838
No, we're not!

180
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,515
We've done it!

181
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,829
Sounds like it's over.

182
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,330
Yeah...

183
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,793
Kakashi...
I need to ask you a favor.

184
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,920
What is it?

185
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,844
His...
I want to see his face...

186
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,099
All right.

187
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,000
Huh?

188
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,878
Snow...

189
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,963
Snow at this time
of the year...?

190
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,268
Haku...
Are you crying?

191
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,738
Thanks, Kakashi...

192
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,791
You were always at my side...

193
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,835
At the very least...

194
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,630
I can be at your side in the end.

195
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,644
If it's possible...

196
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,107
I'd like to go...

197
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,444
to the same place...

198
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,491
as you.

199
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,888
This guy...

200
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:58,852
He was born in a village
where it snowed a lot.

201
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,604
I see...

202
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,067
He was a boy as pure as snow...

203
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,696
You'd be able to go, Zabuza.

204
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,285
The two of you...together.

205
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,291
But you know, Kakashi Sensei...

206
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,625
Hmm?

207
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,794
I wonder if the way a Ninja
should be

208
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,256
is really as these
two were saying.

209
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:34,345
Shinobi should not seek
the reason for their own existence.

210
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,267
What's important is to
exist merely as tools.

211
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,896
That's the same in the Land of Leaves.

212
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,649
I wonder if that's what
it really means

213
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,110
to become a real Ninja.

214
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,821
I guess... I guess...!

215
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,990
I don't like that!

216
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,451
Do you think so, too?

217
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,328
Hmm...

218
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,332
Well... That's why all Ninja live

219
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,920
trying to figure that
out without realizing...

220
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,382
Like Zabuza...and that kid...

221
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,348
Okay!

222
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,599
Huh?

223
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,601
I've just decided!

224
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,813
I'm going to pursue my
own Way of Ninja!

225
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,274
I'm gonna sprint straight
ahead and pursue

226
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,528
a way that I absolutely
won't regret!

227
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,460
Thanks to you the bridge
was safely completed,

228
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,463
but we will miss you very much.

229
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,714
Take care.

230
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,925
Thank you for everything.

231
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,176
Now, now!

232
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,179
We'll come back for
a visit again, Tazuna!

233
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,182
For sure...?

234
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,392
Huh?

235
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,859
Inari...you're gonna
miss us, aren't you?

236
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,361
It's all right to cry.
Go ahead and cry!

237
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,238
I won't cry!

238
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,324
It's all right if you cry,
Naruto!

239
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,286
Oh, is that so?

240
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,919
-See ya!
-Oh...!

241
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,008
You are so stubborn.

242
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,891
That boy changed Inari's mind...

243
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,894
and Inari changed the minds
of the village people.

244
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:51,357
That boy created a bridge
linking us to hope,

245
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,610
a bridge called courage.

246
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,446
So a linking bridge...

247
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,072
Speaking of bridges,

248
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,325
we need to name
this bridge, don't we?

249
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,743
That's true.

250
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,789
In that case, I have a perfect name
for this bridge.

251
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,583
Yeah, what is it?

252
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,337
The Naruto Great Bridge?
How's that?

253
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,298
That's a good name.

254
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,177
Okay! I'll get back soon
and have Iruka Sensei treat me

255
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,555
to ramen as
the mission completion celebration!

256
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,894
And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru
tales of my heroic exploits!

257
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,812
Then I...

258
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,067
Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go on a date
when we get back to the village?

259
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,985
No, I don't think so.

260
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,862
Just like that...?!

261
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,990
You know! You know!
I'll go with you!

262
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,451
Be quiet!
Shut up! Naruto!

263
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:48,039
What? Are you sure
that name's okay?

264
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,963
This name is to wish that
this bridge will never collapse...

265
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:59,717
And someday, it'll be the name
of a very famous bridge...

266
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,929
A name heard around the world.

267
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,559
That's truly what I hope.

268
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,082
Hey, hey!

269
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,959
Our Group Seven always
has the easy missions lately.

270
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,461
Meanwhile, there are plenty of
powerful Ninja

271
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,297
like Zabuza and Haku in other lands.

272
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,676
Aren't there more exciting missions
where I can be more active?

273
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,513
Where I can use my Way of
the Ninja and my soul like...you know?

274
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:14,435
Next time:
"A New Chapter Begins:
The Chunin Exam!"

275
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,646
This is my Way of Ninja!
