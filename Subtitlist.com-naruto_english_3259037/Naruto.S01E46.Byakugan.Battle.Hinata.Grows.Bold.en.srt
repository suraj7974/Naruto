1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,467
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,357
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,128
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,797
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,075
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,559
I'm going to be Hokage!

20
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,855
I won't lose here!

21
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,109
Whatever! You can't keep up
with my speed at all!

22
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,655
U-!

23
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,868
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!

24
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,375
Naruto Barrage!

25
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,605
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

26
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,152
I'm...getting stronger!

27
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,281
Ohhhh!

28
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,866
Cha!

29
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,244
Nice one! You did it!

30
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,831
T-That Naruto beat Kiba!

31
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,708
It's a major upset...

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,209
Yup!

33
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,045
Yes!

34
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:55,050
Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!

35
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,642
This medicine works really well!

36
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,980
Here! Do you want to use it too, Sakura?

37
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:14,361
Only your wounds heal
with such speed...Naruto.

38
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,158
The power of Nine Tail never
cease to amaze me.

39
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965
U-Umm...

40
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,851
T-This is...

41
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:46,936
ointment for your wound,

42
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,563
for you Kiba and Akamaru.

43
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,776
Rather than worrying about others,

44
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,362
it's about time you worried
about yourself!

45
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,072
Kiba...

46
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,990
There are only 6 people left...

47
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:05,996
you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,
and the Sand guy.

48
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,416
Listen, Hinata...

49
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,338
If you pull that guy from Sand,
withdraw quickly.

50
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,799
And there's one more...

51
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,218
Do the same if you get Neji, too.

52
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,011
Withdraw quickly...

53
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,598
That guy will be hard on you.

54
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,767
He will destroy you.

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,479
Well, let's announce the next match.

56
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,272
– Huh?
– Huh?

57
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,030
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

58
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,995
Hinata...

59
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,915
This is going to be an interesting match...

60
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,810
I never thought that I would
have a fight with you...

61
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,270
Lady Hinata.

62
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,105
Brother Neji...

63
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,565
Brother?

64
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,649
Huh?!

65
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,818
Those two are siblings?

66
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,491
They're descended from

67
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,619
one of the most honorable
old families in the Hidden Leaf...

68
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,163
The Hyuga Clan.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,957
But, they're not siblings.

70
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,835
Then, how are they related?

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,717
Well, the relation of a head family
and branch family...

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,552
That may be an appropriate way to say it.

73
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,305
Head family and branch family?

74
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,473
Yes!

75
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,601
Hinata is from the head family.

76
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,853
In other words, a person from
the main household

77
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,065
and Neji is from a branch family
that is descended from that family.

78
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,401
In other words,
it's a fight between relatives.

79
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,488
It must be uneasy for both of them...

80
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,740
Yes. However...

81
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,241
Huh? What is it?

82
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,702
I've heard that from long ago,

83
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,829
there've been various incidents between
the head family and branch family,

84
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,582
and now their relationship
isn't on very good terms.

85
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,710
Hmmm. Why?

86
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,546
I don't know the details either. Only...

87
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,968
The so-called distinguished Ninja clans
like Uchiha and Hyuga

88
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,971
have special techniques and
abilities that run in the family.

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,808
It seems that the Hyuga household
laid down rules

90
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,769
for communicating those techniques...

91
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,523
It seems that there are many rules
that favor the head family...

92
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,233
– Huh?
– Huh?

93
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,734
And there have been various incidents

94
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,946
between the head family and
branch family due to those rules.

95
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,909
So this is a confrontation billed
as a clash of fate...

96
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,836
Oh, it's gonna begin.

97
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,297
Start the battle please!

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,219
Just one thing before we square off
against each other in the fight...

99
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,055
I should advise you, Lady Hinata.

100
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,224
Withdraw!

101
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,227
You're not suited to being a Shinobi.

102
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,149
You're too nice.

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,986
You wish for harmony and avoid conflict,

104
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,072
you're open to going with
the thinking of others.

105
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,077
And, you have no confidence in yourself.

106
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,705
You're always feeling inferior...

107
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,624
You thought it's a good idea
to stay Genin.

108
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,879
However, you can't register for
the Chunin test without three members...

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,841
So you couldn't turn down when Kiba
and the other proposed it and,

110
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,094
the truth is, you entered
the exam reluctantly.

111
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,637
Is that wrong?!

112
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,639
T-That's wrong...

113
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,057
That's not true...

114
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,684
I...

115
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,269
I only...

116
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,106
I wanted to change that about myself...
So I proposed it myself...

117
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,448
Hinata...

118
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,210
Stand up, Hanabi!

119
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,343
From now on, I'll keep Hinata
under my wing...

120
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,887
But is that really okay?

121
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,476
Hinata should be the heir to
the Hyuga clan...

122
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,813
But, there is always death involved
with the job of Genin.

123
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,358
Do what you want.

124
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,072
She's a failure who's inferior even to her
younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.

125
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,783
We don't need her here in Hyuga clan...

126
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,459
Is that all you have to say?

127
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,211
If so, leave!

128
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,921
You're in the way!

129
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,006
Yes.

130
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,021
Hinata is trying to change
herself in her own way.

131
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,658
Lady Hinata...

132
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,120
You are a spoiled one of the head family.

133
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,040
People can never change!

134
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,044
A failure will always be a failure...

135
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,589
That personality and strength
won't change.

136
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,013
That guy...

137
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,188
Since people don't change,
differences exist among them...

138
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,442
and expressions like "elite"
and "failure" are born.

139
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,236
Everyone judges and are judged

140
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,405
based on the value of their face and
brain, ability and body type,

141
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,950
good and bad points of
their personalities.

142
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,411
People have to suffer and live

143
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:24,291
within the means of the
elements they cannot change.

144
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,669
Just like the fact that I'm from a
branch family

145
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,921
and you're from the head family,

146
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,174
these things can't change.

147
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,554
I've seen everything with this Byakugan.

148
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,598
That's why I understand!

149
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,558
You're just talking tough.

150
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,480
You're really thinking that you'd
like to run away from this place...

151
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,317
T-That's wrong... I really...

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,693
Byakugan?

153
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,905
It's said that if you trace
the Uchiha Clan's history,

154
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,824
the clan's ability has its source
in Hyuga clan.

155
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,622
The Byakugan is one of the
Hyuga clan's Kekkei Genkai,

156
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,666
a Visual Jutsu similar to Sharingan...

157
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,003
However, with the ability of insight alone...

158
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,672
it gets the better of Sharingan.

159
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,685
Byakugan!

160
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,106
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

161
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,823
My eyes can't be deceived.

162
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,742
Just now from my pressure,

163
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:27,164
your line of sight was pushed
to the upper left.

164
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:32,252
This is the sign that you're recalling
your past experience...

165
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,171
your bitter past.

166
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:39,176
And soon after that, your line of sight
moved to the bottom right...

167
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,639
This is the sign that you're imagining
physical and mental suffering.

168
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,892
That means...

169
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,227
you're picturing your old self,

170
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,896
and from all of your experiences
up until now,

171
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,648
9you're imagining the result
of this battle...

172
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,110
The image of you losing!

173
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,414
Even the act of propping your arms
in front of your body...

174
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,084
It's a gesture that means

175
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,921
you want to build a wall
between us and keep distant.

176
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,174
And that reflects your mind...

177
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,052
that you don't want any more
of your deepest feelings to be raided...

178
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,847
Because everything I've said
is right on the mark, right?

179
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,142
Furthermore...

180
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,690
Laying a finger on your lips,

181
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,194
that too, is a self-familiarizing act
which represents a sense of panic.

182
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,406
It represents a defense instinct...

183
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,492
you want to alleviate the tension
and unease.

184
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,953
In other words...

185
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,331
deep in your heart,
you know it's true, don't you?

186
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,835
Changing yourself,
is something you absolutely can't...!

187
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,379
Sure, she can!

188
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,057
You don't have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!

189
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,726
Give it to him, Hinata!

190
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,815
Naruto...

191
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,241
Hinata!

192
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,035
Don't just take it! Argue back!

193
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,996
I'm getting irritated watching this!

194
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,680
Naruto...

195
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,641
What an annoying guy!

196
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,858
Naruto...

197
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,737
Thank you!

198
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,951
The expression of her eyes has changed...

199
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,787
So you're not going to withdraw?

200
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,664
I 'm not taking responsibility
for what happens!

201
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,416
I...

202
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,795
I won't run away!

203
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,464
I don't...

204
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,508
I don't change my words...

205
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,260
That's my Way of Ninja!

206
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,929
...want to run anymore!

207
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,432
Byakugan!

208
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,611
Brother Neji!

209
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,488
I challenge you!

210
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,323
T-That is...

211
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,502
Fine...

212
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,175
Of course, the same Hyuga style...

213
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,136
Her pose is very similar to Neji's.

214
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,429
Hyuga style?

215
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,225
The strongest Taijutsu style
in the Village Hidden in the Leaf...

216
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,434
Huh?

217
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,436
I said it before...

218
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,314
The man who is most likely

219
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,693
the strongest Genin of Hidden
Leaf Village is on my team...

220
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,902
That's...

221
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,196
That guy, Neji Hyuga.

222
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,952
Here!

223
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,421
Did it go in?!

224
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,465
No...it was shallow!

225
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,760
No. Even a graze works.

226
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,179
That's the reason that the Hyuga clan

227
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,347
is called the Hidden Leaf's
distinguished family.

228
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,600
Huh? What do you mean?

229
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:43,563
The Hyuga has a particular
Taijutsu passed down through generations.

230
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,528
It's not like the kind of Taijutsu that
Lee and I are good at...

231
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,282
Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,

232
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,786
is mainly to inflict external damage
on our enemy,

233
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,913
like broken bones and surface wounds.

234
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,665
In contrast, the Hyuga's Taijutsu
inflict damage

235
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,668
on the Chakra Network through
which Chakra flow through the body,

236
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:10,006
and damaging the insides,
namely, it destroys internal organs.

237
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,008
They possess the Gentle Fist.

238
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,178
It's not spectacular to watch...

239
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,388
but later it slowly takes effect.

240
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:22,060
Well, you can't train the internal organs...

241
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,980
Even if you were really robust,
one hit from it would be a deadly blow...

242
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,577
Even I can...

243
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,413
Hinata's on the offensive...

244
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,874
Hinata...

245
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,670
Way to go, Hinata!

246
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,381
To attack the Chakra Network...

247
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,342
What are they, those people...?

248
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,554
Hey! Hey!

249
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,431
Chakra Network, what's that?!

250
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,184
Here we go again...
a question from a stupid guy.

251
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,562
I'll explain.

252
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,480
They're like blood canals.

253
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,816
In the same way that blood flows
through vessels throughout the body,

254
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:15,905
They're bundles of canals that take
Chakra's into every corner of your body...

255
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,615
Oh!

256
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,868
Like a path for Chakras, huh?

257
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,035
Yes...

258
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,162
Furthermore, the Chakra Network
is closely connected

259
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:27,709
with the internal organs which
enfold Chakra within the body.

260
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,253
That's why if
the Chakra Network is attacked

261
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,881
the internal organs also suffer damage.

262
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,675
Huh, you know a lot, don't 'ya?

263
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,636
Hey you!
That's no way to talk to your senior!

264
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,815
It's no wonder...

265
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,776
Lee's greatest long-standing enemy.

266
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,487
That's... him.

267
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,326
Sensei... But, how can they do that?

268
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,413
After all, the Chakra Network
isn't visible to the eyes.

269
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,292
How do they attack the Chakra
line inside the body?

270
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,712
No. The eyes of those two...

271
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,674
They can see it with their Byakugan.

272
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,725
And a Gentle Fist attack is a little
different from a regular attack.

273
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,354
They release their own Chakra

274
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,399
from a Chakra opening in their hand
and screw it into their opponent's body.

275
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,320
It directly inflicts damage on
your enemy's Chakra Network.

276
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,741
All right!

277
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,620
Has she done it?

278
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,269
Hey, can you hear it?

279
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,022
The clear,

280
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:18,695
blue sky goes on and on

281
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:26,619
The ocean spans limitlessly

282
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:35,712
Please keep that smile on your face forever

283
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,219
Or else I'll cry

284
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,973
You won't have to search around you

285
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,310
It's all ok now.

286
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:56,649
Everyone is

287
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,069
inside this hand

288
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:05,366
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

289
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,787
When you forget what happiness is

290
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

291
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:19,005
Light is born, and darkness was born

292
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,382
The two are one

293
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:27,722
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

294
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:33,352
Hey, can you hear it?

295
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,650
Amazing! That Hinata!

296
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,652
She's always melancholy
and wishy-washy and...

297
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,155
I thought she is kinda weird, yet...

298
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,699
Even when she gets blow after blow,
she gets back up and goes.

299
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,951
There's something about
her way of fighting.

300
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,161
Just a feeling,
but she resembles you, I think.

301
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,872
Resembles me? Hinata resembles me?

302
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,291
Now that I think about it, that girl,
she was always watching you.

303
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,584
Huh?

304
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,420
Next episode: "A Failure Stands Tall!"

305
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,839
Hinata, fight!
