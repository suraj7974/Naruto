1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,346
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,351
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,270
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,776
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,492
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,912
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,750
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,336
I wake up

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,301
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:02,021
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,691
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,028
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,915
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,838
One more time

23
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,538
That darn Naruto...

24
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,293
Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!

25
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,132
– C'mon!
– Hurry up with the match!

26
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,093
Finish it up already!

27
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:19,223
Stand up and start the match!

28
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:24,061
Evidently, people don't want to
see the minor players' matches

29
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,941
since they were really looking
forward to Sasuke's match...

30
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,737
If people aren't expecting anything
exciting from this battle,

31
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,823
makes no sense
for me to have it.

32
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,619
What? You're giving up, too?

33
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,082
My opponent's a girl again?

34
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,879
-Hey, why aren't you moving?!
-C'mon, get started!

35
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,591
That kid has had zero fighting spirit
from the beginning...

36
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,343
C'mon! What is he doing?!

37
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,556
C'mon Shikamaru!
Get it together and do it!

38
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,020
If you don't come, I'll go!

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
Hey! Haven't started yet...

40
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:13,068
Man, that girl is so gung-ho.

41
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,796
It doesn't really matter

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,757
if I become a Chunin or not.

43
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,053
But there's no reason why
a man should lose to a woman.

44
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,222
Well... let's do it!

45
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,908
This guy's quick to run away...

46
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,667
Nor any reason why a man should
rough up a woman.

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,128
But I don't want to be
roughed up either.

48
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,715
He's the kind of Ninja that
uses shadows.

49
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,884
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

50
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,894
He's probably trying to lure me into
the trees where there're lots of shadows...

51
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,688
but I won't let him.

52
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,567
Why am I the only one who always
gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!

53
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,528
Shikamaru!

54
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,949
You get her with
a torrent of 16 combination...!

55
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,537
-Mind if I sit here?
-Huh?

56
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,541
What...you?
Your stomach okay?

57
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,298
What? Wasn't Sasuke's match next?

58
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,557
Everything's fine, right, Sakura?
After all, it's Sasuke, right?

59
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,686
R-Right now, I should leave her alone.

60
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,690
It looks like Shikamaru taking part
in this final battle,

61
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,442
it seems like he's in the wrong place.

62
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,819
Don't say that!

63
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,197
I certainly don't think that
he has any great techniques,

64
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,285
but that Shikamaru is
always good at strategizing.

65
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:31,331
That's why I feel like we ended up
in the preliminary round the other day.

66
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,751
Hmm, yeah well...

67
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,212
And after all, he jumped down
into the arena himself.

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,300
He seems uncharacteristically driven.

69
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,261
Even he can be passionate
once in a while!

70
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,806
Go! Shikamaru!

71
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,060
Geez,

72
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,564
I envy a cloud being so free...

73
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,197
I guess I pretty much
am completely without desire...

74
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,449
Even the reason why I became a Ninja...

75
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,787
was because I thought
I would have a fun life, ya know...

76
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,880
Get it together!

77
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,257
C'mon Shikamaru!

78
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:30,099
But...of course, it's not that easy.

79
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,061
What's going on with that stupid face?!
Is he underestimating me?

80
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,063
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!

81
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,036
That's right, with this attack,

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,289
my armed attacks also were beaten down.

83
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,060
I see...

84
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,111
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
I've seen that true identity!

85
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,781
Evidently there's a limit to
the stretching and shortening,

86
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,576
changing shape of the shadow...

87
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,911
No matter how much you
change the shape of the shadow,

88
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,121
even when you stretch it,

89
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,624
it can only span up to
the size of your own shadow.

90
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,877
That's right isn't it?

91
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,546
You got it...

92
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,508
Even if I assume that he's made up
the distance,

93
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:50,220
by stretching his shadow from the edge
of the shadow of the arena wall...

94
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,599
This is the limit to how far
the shadow can stretch.

95
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,852
This is the scope of his attack!

96
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,522
15 meters, 32 centimeters!

97
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,567
She took the distance
with the folding fan.

98
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,279
Temari is stronger at long distance
battles than she is at close range...

99
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,282
the outcome has already been decided.

100
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,935
What? What is that sign...?

101
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,605
That's no sign.

102
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,815
That's like, his habit.

103
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,484
Habit...?

104
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,988
He enjoys passing time slowly.

105
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,574
That guy's like an old man.

106
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,452
That's why he likes
Japanese checkers and chess

107
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,538
and always makes me be his opponent.

108
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,005
When he's stuck on a move,
he always does that.

109
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,305
Why?

110
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,267
He's working out his strategy.

111
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,612
And, I've never beaten him.

112
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,908
A strategy...
but this is an actual fight.

113
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,660
It's different from a game.

114
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,038
But it's said that formation pieces
that were used to build battle strategy

115
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,541
eventually become
game pieces.

116
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,628
Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.

117
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,672
Wait a minute.

118
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,259
When we grouped the Genin,
I saw his scores.

119
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,095
They were at about the
same level of that Naruto's.

120
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,183
He said that moving his pencil during
written exams at the academy is a pain,

121
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,978
and during the tests,
he always sleeps instead.

122
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,313
A pain...?

123
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,205
He was so good at strategy games,

124
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,582
I felt something wasn't right...

125
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,046
so I had him take an IQ test
under the pretense that it was a game.

126
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,720
And... how did it turn out?... ...

127
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,018
He was more than brilliant.

128
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,647
With an IQ of over 200,
he's a super genius!

129
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,859
T-Two hundred?!

130
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,578
He's done thinking...
It starts now.

131
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,176
Looks like you've got some
fighting spirit now...

132
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,146
It's pointless to hide!

133
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,823
I wonder if he's really got a strategy...

134
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,409
M-Maybe...

135
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,128
With that he has no approach!

136
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,255
Shikamaru! Go for it!

137
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,298
It's pointless, isn't it?

138
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,426
He'll give up soon.

139
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,052
He hates things
that are a pain in the butt.

140
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:03,098
You're wrong!
At least, I hope so...

141
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,350
But you may be right...

142
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,179
How long are you going to run away!
Cut it out!

143
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,357
It's no use.

144
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,067
As long as I'm on the
outside of this line,

145
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,028
he absolutely can't catch me...

146
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,822
No, wait! Close call!

147
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,166
You caught on well.

148
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,878
So you were dragging your feet
to wait for the sun to set...

149
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,589
in order to make the surface
of your own shadow larger

150
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,842
by stretching the shadow line of the wall.

151
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,930
As the sun goes down,
the shadows lengthen.

152
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,556
Isn't that so?

153
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,522
That was close! Shikamaru...

154
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,816
But why is he using shadows?

155
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,612
After all, Shikamaru is inside
the shadow of the field.

156
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,950
If there's even a little bit of light,
he can make a shadow within a shadow!

157
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,745
You don't know a thing
about Shikamaru!

158
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,207
A shadow...in a shadow...?

159
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,802
Even if I calculate the height
of the sun now

160
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,596
and the limit to the distance
of the previous attack,

161
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,891
there's no mistaking the distance!

162
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,235
Temari! Up!

163
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,071
I see.

164
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,490
What's this?!

165
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,412
Darn it!

166
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,342
I won't let you escape!

167
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,307
I didn't expect that he would
create extra shadows to reach me

168
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,183
by making a parachute with his jacket...!

169
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,646
He's impressive.

170
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,401
Once I notice the parachute from above,
I'll take my attention off from my feet.

171
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,779
That's a sneaky trick to catch me
off my guard!

172
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,449
However, now it's clear.

173
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,743
Shadow Possession Jutsu is

174
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,746
one in which other shadows are used
to get your opponent,

175
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,706
a skillful technique!

176
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,805
She's dodged this trick too...

177
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,807
Not careful enough in the final stage.

178
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,062
And his opponent is fairly analytical.

179
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,938
She's good at thinking ahead.

180
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,198
If this battle takes too long,

181
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,951
the shadows in the arena will grow,
and his territory will increase.

182
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,291
I'll defeat him with the next one!

183
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,545
Should I make a diversion
with Clone Jutsu...?

184
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,556
Now his shadow is...

185
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,810
Okay!

186
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,188
Clone...

187
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,193
N-No way...!

188
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,702
My... body is...?!

189
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,168
At last...
Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!

190
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,962
What?!

191
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,094
What's going on...?

192
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,595
1That boy...

193
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,557
How much is he planning ahead...?

194
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,810
That's Shikamaru's skill.

195
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,480
Why...won't my body move?!

196
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,358
The shadow shouldn't
have reached this far.

197
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,029
I'll let you take a look behind you...

198
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,791
T-This hole...!

199
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,252
You saw it too, didn't you...?

200
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,466
That hole is the hole Naruto
burrowed and flew out of.

201
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,679
So it's connected to the
big hole in front of you.

202
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:40,727
I didn't expect that...
a shadow in a tunnel of a hole...

203
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,979
Right.

204
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,900
Pure and simple,
a calculated chess move.

205
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,495
So his purpose to make Temari measure
the limit of the shadow several times

206
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:03,249
was to lead her to his final trick
of using this hole.

207
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,256
Temari battled on the outside
of the limit of the shadow

208
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,801
that she measured and followed,

209
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,846
but he caught her from behind,

210
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,475
trailed by the shadow she couldn't see...

211
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,477
There is no escape from this.

212
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,813
I-It can't be...

213
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,400
The attack that he used
with the jacket,

214
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,404
was it a device to lead me
to right this spot...?

215
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,449
Was that an underplot too?!

216
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,702
Why that...?!

217
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,622
Checkmate with the next one.

218
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,759
My body is moving on its own!
I can't resist it!

219
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,692
Before anyone knew it,
they fell under the spell of this match.

220
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,320
That guy with no mark
is quite a darkhorse.

221
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,532
Yes! You did it!

222
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,535
Go! Shikamaru!

223
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,415
Check...

224
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,323
Good grief... I give up!

225
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,042
What?!

226
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,925
See I told you...he'd give up.

227
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,388
Ino doesn't know anything
about Shikamaru.

228
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,849
W-What did you say?!

229
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,773
I've used too much Chakra from Shadow
Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.

230
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,983
I can't hold it another 10 seconds.

231
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:40,239
I thought of the next trick 200 times.

232
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,825
But I'm out of time...

233
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,290
This has become such a pain.

234
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,042
Doing one match is good...

235
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,254
That guy is a strange one.

236
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,299
The winner is Temari!

237
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,358
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

238
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,778
``Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says "I LOVE YOU"

239
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,198
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

240
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,576
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

241
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,247
All over the world, the sky's smiling,

242
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,083
so look up and smile too

243
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:38,131
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

244
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,757
Fight! Fight! Fight!

245
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,104
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

246
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,482
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

247
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,902
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

248
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,489
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

249
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,909
All over the world, the sky's smiling,

250
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,829
so look up and smile too

251
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:15,835
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

252
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,003
Fight! Fight! Fight!

253
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:23,468
All over the world, the sky's smiling,
so look up and smile too

254
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:29,599
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

255
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,142
Fight! Fight! Fight!

256
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:40,193
Wow, this is the largest cheer
from the audience ever!

257
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,529
Of course. The featured battle of
this final tournament is about to begin.

258
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,073
Hate to admit it,
but I'm looking forward to it myself.

259
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,992
Hey, Shikamaru.
I can't hear what you said.

260
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,579
There's not a single person

261
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,916
who's not excited
about the featured battle.

262
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,170
Next: "Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"

263
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,757
I can't take my eyes
away from this battle!
