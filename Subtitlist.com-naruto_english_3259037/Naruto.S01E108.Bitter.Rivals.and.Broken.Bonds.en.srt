1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,317
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,219
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,099
That's why it must be good-bye

9
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:03,814
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

10
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,238
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

11
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:17,995
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,415
Trembling thoughts swept

13
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:27,338
into a vortex and melting away

14
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,553
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!

15
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,560
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!

16
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,859
Damn it!

17
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,363
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

18
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,991
I'll win no matter what!

19
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,993
Don't flatter yourself!

20
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,123
Stop it!

21
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,464
Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds

22
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,774
It's a tranquil village as always...

23
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,401
The security sucks.

24
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:37,074
Humph! We should just massacre everybody
in such a seedy village.

25
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,951
Calm down, Sakon.

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,996
We haven't come here to fight.

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,164
Shut up, you chicken.

28
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,249
If you're scared,

29
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,667
you should just go home
and go to bed already.

30
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,879
I'm telling you to calm down, Tayuya.

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,215
You understand what
our job is this time, right?

32
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,261
Let's go. We escort our special guest.

33
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,604
Stop it!

34
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,151
Damn.

35
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,652
I can't stop completely.

36
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:27,958
Kakashi Sensei?

37
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,420
Naruto... That thing you just did was...

38
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,973
What're you guys doing
up on top of the hospital?

39
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,394
You went a bit too far
for just a fight, you two.

40
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,656
That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.

41
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,866
It's the Rasengan.

42
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,790
What's going on?

43
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,334
How can Naruto use that Jutsu...?

44
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,975
Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?

45
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,939
What're you doing giving yourself over
to a sense of superiority?

46
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,195
The size of the Chidori there
wasn't one to be aimed

47
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,364
at a comrade of the same village.

48
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,039
Why such infantile behavior...?

49
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,960
Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi...

50
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,726
Sasuke.

51
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,203
Damn it!

52
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,584
Naruto...

53
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,378
How far will you go...?

54
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,682
Kakashi Sensei...

55
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,901
Whatever happened to teamwork?

56
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,364
Was it you... who taught him that technique?

57
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:51,662
I think Naruto is still too young
to be handling that Jutsu.

58
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,793
He could've killed Sasuke
had something gone wrong...

59
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,506
Even if it's a means of resisting
the Akatsuki,

60
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,925
to think you would teach Naruto
that Jutsu...

61
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,095
Right back at you...

62
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,598
That Chidori was also considerably hairy.

63
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,977
But I didn't think he was the kind of kid

64
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,564
who'd fire that Jutsu at his comrade.

65
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:24,027
Or is it that there's something quite
complicated between him and that kid?

66
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,489
Well, all sorts.

67
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,575
All sorts?

68
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,161
Quite simply, it's a relationship

69
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,454
like the one between you
and Orochimaru in the past.

70
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,127
I see.

71
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:45,257
To him, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time...

72
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,803
Well, someone he considers an equal.

73
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,641
Most likely, he couldn't take
Sasuke's cheap provocation.

74
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,729
He's been chasing him...

75
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,148
Chasing him since the Academy days.

76
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,275
Are you hurt...

77
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,111
Scaredy-Cat?

78
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,366
Sasuke!

79
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,333
I won't lose to you!

80
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,587
For him, it's neither you nor me now...

81
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,256
More than anyone...

82
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,968
he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.

83
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,722
On the other side of the coin...

84
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:38,352
Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto's growth
at close range and feels inferior.

85
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,232
To the extent that he thinks
he himself isn't growing at all.

86
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,400
Scaredy-Cat?

87
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,070
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

88
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,988
Summoning Jutsu!

89
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,413
Naruto has gotten strong...

90
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,874
And Sasuke...

91
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,754
I'm going to kill a certain man,
no matter what.

92
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,215
Revenge, huh...?

93
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,970
I wonder if Itachi
is frustrating that kid.

94
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,556
So Sasuke doesn't want
to acknowledge Naruto.

95
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,725
If he acknowledges him,

96
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,937
he just might deny himself
up to this point...

97
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,774
Rivalry is a difficult thing.

98
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,278
It's not a very good trend...

99
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,239
Maybe I'll do some scolding.

100
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,409
Then I leave Naruto to you.

101
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,204
Well, I have a mission.
And there's the Chidori thing, too...

102
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,834
Sakura.

103
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,672
It's okay. Things can go back to the way
they were in the old days again.

104
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,133
Cheer up.

105
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,844
See ya.

106
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,812
Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.

107
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,234
Naruto...

108
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,403
Sakura.

109
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,826
Don't interfere with us!

110
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,816
You are weak.

111
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,277
Why are you weak?

112
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,488
It's because you don't have enough...

113
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,948
...hate.

114
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,160
What've I been doing...

115
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,580
up until now?

116
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,968
He got a nice look in those eyes.

117
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,902
Shall we go soon?

118
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,594
What do you think you're doing?

119
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,306
If I don't do this,
you'll run away, right?

120
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,601
You're not the type
to listen quietly to lectures.

121
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,772
As I recall,
that's Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

122
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,696
Sasuke... Forget about something
like revenge.

123
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,156
What?

124
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,411
Well, in this business
I've seen a stink of guys like you.

125
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:10,999
But the final days of those who speak
of revenge are never good.

126
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,793
They're tragic.

127
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:21,092
You'll only hurt yourself and
agonize more than now.

128
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,431
Even if you succeed in revenge,
all that will remain is emptiness.

129
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,516
Shut up!

130
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,142
What do you know?

131
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,604
Don't talk to me as if you know!

132
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,065
Well, calm down...

133
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,192
If you like,

134
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,028
shall I go and kill the person
most important to you?

135
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,740
You'll be able to realize just
how far off you are

136
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,200
on what you just said.

137
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,162
Well, I wouldn't mind if you'd do that.

138
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,415
Unfortunately, I don't even have
one person like that.

139
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,337
Everyone's already been killed.

140
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,092
I've lived longer than you have...

141
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,302
The times were not good.

142
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,558
I know all too well
the agony of losing something.

143
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,273
Well, both you and I
aren't the lucky ones...

144
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,358
That's for darned sure.

145
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,736
But we're not the worst, either.

146
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,240
You and I,

147
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,784
we both have already found
dear comrades, haven't we?

148
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,210
It's because I have lost
that I understand.

149
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,421
The Chidori is a power...

150
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,632
I gave to you because
you now have something important.

151
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,969
You should know that it's not a power

152
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,972
to be used on your comrade
or to use for revenge,

153
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,059
and I'm sure you know
what it should be used for.

154
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,273
Think hard about whether or not
what I'm saying is wrong.

155
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,454
It'll be tricky with a Shinobi
of that level hanging around.

156
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,081
So let's wait a bit.

157
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,919
Maybe jerks like you'd be no good.
But I could do it.

158
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:25,091
I wonder. "Two"
should be ample to rip him apart.

159
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,595
Don't be butting in all the time,
you clod.

160
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,932
Tayuya, women shouldn't
use words like that too...

161
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,434
Shut up, fatso.

162
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,506
– More, please!
– More, please!

163
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,726
Wanna head back?
Sure!

164
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,897
We both made it to the top of the tree.

165
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,378
Sakura.

166
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,423
I have a something to talk to you about.

167
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,884
I'll go out on a date with you,
so come along.

168
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,656
Damn it...

169
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,286
Damn it!

170
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,944
The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru
during the Chunin Exam...

171
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,956
Kakashi Sensei said it was okay now, but...

172
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,807
Master Orochimaru.

173
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,311
You didn't need to send out
all four members, did you?

174
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:11,776
It seems those kids are all interested
in Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.

175
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,196
To see what extent his power is...

176
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,115
A contest of strength or whatever,

177
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,368
at this point Sasuke would be
no match for them.

178
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:30,086
That is precisely why...he will come to me
in search of power.

179
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,012
Who're you guys?

180
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,516
I'm Kidomaru, the East Gate
of the Sound Ninja Four.

181
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,185
I'm Sakon, the West Gate of the same.

182
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,147
I'm Jirobo, the South Gate of the same.

183
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,066
I'm Tayuya, the North Gate of the same.

184
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,006
I'm in a bad mood now...

185
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,176
If you wanna continue to fight her,

186
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,886
I won't go easy on you!

187
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:18,152
Once in a long while, once in a while

188
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,284
The remnants of a person broken by dreams

189
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:30,373
Look like a mountain

190
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,383
Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha

191
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:46,639
The remnants of a person crying

192
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,309
Look like a mountain

193
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,605
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

194
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:59,152
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

195
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,030
Shake shake shake Let's look

196
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,908
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

197
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,715
Look like a mountain

198
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,095
Look like a mountain

199
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,682
Look like a mountain

200
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,728
Look like a mountain

201
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,484
A date, a date!

202
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,652
What do you want to eat, Sakura?
Anything's fine.

203
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,906
At any rate,
Kakashi Sensei's over the top.

204
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,742
I just wanted to fight Sasuke a little.

205
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,578
But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it,
right about now...

206
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,874
Of course, which of us was stronger
would be settled, believe it.

207
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,667
Listen, Naruto...

208
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,003
Next time: "An Invitation from the Sound"

209
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,130
I feel uneasy...
