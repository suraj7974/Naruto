1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,679
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,099
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,811
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,273
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,860
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,324
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,620
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:43,711
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:50,801
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:57,349
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,604
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,149
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

14
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,736
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

15
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,490
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,118
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

17
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,663
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,292
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,838
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

20
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,594
Okay! Let's go!

21
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,643
Huh?

22
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,234
"Let's go,"
with so much energy...

23
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,611
Don't act like a little kid!

24
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,572
Oh? You're in a bad mood.

25
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,659
Because! Because!
It's in the middle of my training!

26
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,828
There are three steps
in the training, right?!

27
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm only done with the second step!

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,253
You can do the third step
even while walking.

29
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,505
What! Really?!

30
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,094
A balloon?

31
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,428
Here!

32
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,895
What's this...? An ordinary balloon?

33
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:32,695
The first step is "Spin."
The second step is "Power."

34
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:38,409
And finally, the third step is this.

35
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,872
An Impossible Choice:
The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart

36
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,438
Which one is "this"?!

37
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,693
Watch me, it looks as if
I am simply holding a balloon...

38
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,156
You say it "looks as if,"
but nothing is really happening.

39
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,368
Then, I will do the same thing
on my left hand.

40
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,041
Let's see what's really happening
inside the balloon.

41
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,296
Wow!

42
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,174
The Chakra is randomly spinning
and going faster and faster...

43
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,803
But still, it's perfectly round...
It's almost like...

44
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,598
Like a small typhoon, right?

45
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,019
What's happening in your left hand...

46
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,939
is happening inside that balloon
in your right hand, too?

47
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,900
Yeah! That's right.

48
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,362
Cool...

49
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:03,035
The balloon isn't moving at all
even if he's spinning that much Chakra...

50
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,080
There's more power than
that time the rubber ball popped,

51
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,540
and it's spinning a lot more too!

52
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,168
Listen, in this third step,

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,921
you've got to use 100% of
what you have learned...

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,506
and retain them.

55
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:23,180
In other words, while keeping
the "Spin" and the "Power" at their max,

56
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:27,059
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon

57
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,229
and compressing the Chakra within it.

58
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,651
Got it!

59
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,945
So, this training is about keeping

60
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,114
the spin and power that I did
in the second step,

61
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,117
and conversely,
trying not to pop a delicate balloon!

62
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,870
Oh! That's the most perceptive
you've been so far!

63
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,540
Huh?

64
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,585
But, what's the point in going
to all the trouble?!

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,757
In short, it means this.

66
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,263
Watch! It's like this up until
the second step of the training.

67
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,611
Next, after you have mastered
the third step!

68
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,998
This is what happens!

69
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,562
If you can keep this small typhoon
the size of your palm,

70
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,314
the force won't disperse.

71
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,608
The spinning gets faster and faster

72
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,526
and the power gets
more and more compressed.

73
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,907
And the destructive power
will reach its max.

74
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,745
Well, so, that's that.

75
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,169
All right! I'll do this, too!

76
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,814
Okay, this feels right...

77
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,987
Now!

78
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,198
Retain it here!

79
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,159
Retain...

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,043
Retain...

81
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,467
No cutting-corners!

82
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,263
You've got to put out 100% spin and power,
and retain them.

83
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,140
You gotta be kidding...

84
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,728
Unless I can perfectly control all my power,
it's impossible!

85
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,567
Now I can see it...

86
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,819
This third step...

87
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,947
It's on a totally different level
compared to the others.

88
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,657
I told you...

89
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,911
With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,
it's a super advanced Ninjutsu.

90
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,877
Well, I'm done explaining!
We'll continue as we go on walking.

91
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,338
Hey, hey!

92
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,675
We don't need to rush so much,
until I can properly...

93
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,304
We have already wasted enough time
waiting for your body to recover.

94
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,101
There's no guarantee that
Tsunade stays in this town much longer.

95
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,062
What?!
But, but...

96
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,024
It's not like an old acquaintance
is going to conveniently pop up

97
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,484
and start talking about
the good old times with her...

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,528
Come on, let's go!

99
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,530
All right...

100
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,614
Long time no see...Orochimaru.

101
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,576
I'd looked for you everywhere.

102
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,454
What do you want from me
after so long a time?

103
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
You aren't thinking of talking
about the old days...?

104
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:06,004
Actually, I need to ask you
for a little favor...

105
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,757
His heartbeat is fast...

106
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,593
From that complexion,
he must have a high fever.

107
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,637
He must have been fatigued
for quite some time...

108
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,973
And that arm...

109
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,977
Lady Tsunade.

110
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,939
You must have understood by now.

111
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,026
Go to someone else,
I don't treat anyone any more.

112
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,070
That won't do...

113
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,824
You must know how serious this wound is...

114
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,743
No one can treat this wound.

115
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,789
Except for one of the Legendary "Sannin"

116
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,500
who won her fame as
a medical specialist, Princess Tsunade...

117
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,794
You...

118
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,428
That arm...
it's not an ordinary wound.

119
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,725
A special Sealing Jutsu or something...?

120
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,728
What have you done?

121
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,858
Well, it just happened...
when I killed the Third Hokage.

122
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,156
You... Really?

123
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:19,619
Humph. Don't look so scary.

124
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,373
Anything that has a form
will one day decay...

125
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,584
Same goes for humans.

126
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,093
You must already know that too.

127
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:47,022
For you have let two of
your most beloved ones die...

128
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:09,503
Let two of the most beloved ones die?

129
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,716
I see... He thinks of terrible things.

130
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:30,190
That was a really terrible way to die...

131
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,525
You!

132
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,995
Poisoned...

133
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,751
She's fast!
Get out of my way!

134
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,002
Won't let you!

135
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,965
Calm down, Shizune!

136
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,817
This attendant...is an expert.

137
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,954
Orochimaru...

138
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,458
Your personality's been like this
for a long time.

139
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,799
And you know my personality
very well...

140
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,551
So stop fooling around with me.

141
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,782
I'll kill you, bastard!

142
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,577
She's powerful...

143
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:12,209
And so scary...
she definitely must be single.

144
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,589
Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered...

145
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,931
Hey Naruto,
there's no time to be falling.

146
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,474
If we don't hurry,

147
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,936
who knows where that shrew
will disappear again.

148
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,354
Hey you, Pervy Sage!

149
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,524
That's no way to speak to
a hard-working apprentice!

150
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:40,195
Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,
not you.

151
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,157
Well, what the heck!

152
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,708
To have this Pervy Sage come
all the way to meet her...

153
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,877
Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?

154
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,551
Hope she's still here...

155
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,975
We didn't come here to fight.

156
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,978
We just want to negotiate with you!

157
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,355
Negotiate?

158
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,481
Yes.

159
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,441
Don't make me laugh!

160
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,865
I've already told you once.
Get out of my sight!

161
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,118
We can't do that.

162
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,495
Get out of my sight.

163
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,583
You are the only one
who can treat Lord Orochimaru's arm.

164
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,835
Get out of my sight.

165
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,254
We're not asking you to do it for free.

166
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,547
Let's make a deal!

167
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:45,010
I'll count up to five.
Leave before I'm done.

168
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,973
Or else, I'll make you disappear myself.

169
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,644
Please calm down.
It won't be a bad deal for you...

170
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,729
Five...

171
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,732
Four...

172
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,069
Three...

173
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,323
Two...

174
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,076
One...

175
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:16,458
I'll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved...

176
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,090
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.

177
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,904
Since we haven't disappeared yet,

178
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:51,076
I'm guessing that the deal is made?

179
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,044
Yes. I do know this young lady...

180
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,337
Really?

181
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,505
Yeah.

182
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,008
To win back the money she lost here,
I think she said...

183
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,094
she was going over there.

184
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,346
Spin... Power...

185
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,558
Letting them out to their max
and retain it...

186
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,477
Hey, kid.

187
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,561
Hmm?

188
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,189
Wanna gamble a bit, too?

189
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,192
Over there? Where is that?

190
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,152
Hmm?

191
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,655
See, if the total number of the pips
on these dices

192
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,198
comes out as even numbers,
that's "Cho"

193
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,991
and if it's odd, that's "Han."

194
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,371
Shut up! I am training right now,
don't bug me!

195
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,541
What nonsense!
This is a gambling house.

196
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,336
Instead of that balloon,
let's play with these.

197
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:48,800
No way! I don't have any time
to be playing with those dice!

198
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,803
Ha, what a boring kid!
Shut up!

199
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,264
So...can you tell me where that is?

200
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,476
Well, you can't expect things to be free
in a gambling house, you know?

201
00:16:58,893 --> 00:16:59,936
Okay...

202
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,613
Let's make a deal.
The information will be free if you win...

203
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,241
And if you lose,
I'll give it to you for 1000 ryo.

204
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,701
All right!

205
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,953
So choose, odd or even!

206
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
Okay! Here we go...

207
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,673
Well, so...
since I am exactly 50 years old.

208
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,092
I'll go for...even!

209
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,012
If it's odd, I win...

210
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,556
I'll open it now.

211
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,355
Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!

212
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,026
W-What the heck...?!

213
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,486
1000 ryo...

214
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,115
Nice, Naruto!

215
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,119
Looks like I won...

216
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:04,083
Darn! It didn't work again!

217
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,756
Retain...

218
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,928
Where shall I look next?

219
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,609
Geez, she's nowhere to be found!

220
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,995
Hm? Me?

221
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,458
Lotto?

222
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,378
Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.

223
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,422
Come and play with
this fun, fun Lotto.

224
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,050
There's one that you know
the result right away.

225
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,426
Which one do you want?

226
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,434
Really, you are so much cuter
being chubby!

227
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,730
I can't believe he won
with just one draw.

228
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,109
He's very talented in this...

229
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,779
though his talent in Jutsu
is still immature.

230
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,032
Well...anyhow...

231
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,077
Where could have Tsunade gone?

232
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,415
She couldn't have gone that far
in this short amount of time.

233
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,045
I guess we'll have to
search for her from a higher place.

234
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,883
If I remember it correctly,
this is a castle town.

235
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,385
If we go up to the castle...

236
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,013
Naruto! This way!

237
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,903
Don't you want to see those two...
Tsunade?

238
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,913
Nawaki...Dan...

239
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:18,718
If I treat your arms,
what do you intend to do with them?

240
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,684
Well, I don't like to lie...

241
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,688
So, I will tell you the truth.

242
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,073
Hey, hey! Where is the castle?

243
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,537
It's not there...?

244
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,543
In addition to getting what I want...

245
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:03,638
This time, I will completely destroy
the Leaf Village!

246
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,523
A cycle of hardship, right?

247
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:18,319
Inside, we were crying, right?

248
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,781
But the one thing we won't give up

249
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:27,412
is the dream we've chosen, right?

250
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,623
It's a secondary role,

251
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,337
a role in the shadows

252
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,634
But in reaching for that dream,

253
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:47,473
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

254
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,228
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

255
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:57,316
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

256
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,277
Over and over,

257
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,822
we believed

258
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,076
and dreamed

259
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,582
Over and over,
we've seen fools

260
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:18,171
Over and over,
we've stood in the shadows of others

261
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,175
Now, it's our turn...

262
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:29,098
Let us bask in our dreams

263
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,026
Hey, enough already!

264
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,444
Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!

265
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,196
Who cares if she is
the legendary Kunoichi?!

266
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,323
Who cares if she's
the medical specialist?!

267
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,326
There's no way I'll accept
this person as the new Hokage!

268
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,455
If she belittles the Third
and Fourth Hokages...

269
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,749
I don't care if she's the candidate
to be the Fifth Hokage!

270
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,376
I'll kick her butt!

271
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,756
Next time:
"Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!"
