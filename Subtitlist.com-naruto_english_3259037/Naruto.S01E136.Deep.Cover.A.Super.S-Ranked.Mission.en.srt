1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,382
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,517
listen up!

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,226
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:35,137
Deep Cover?!
A Super S-Rank Mission

22
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,068
It could be that way...

23
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:02,039
Sure enough, Ichiraku ramen is
the best for getting energized!

24
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,791
One more, Pops!

25
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,709
Coming right up!

26
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,465
Huh?

27
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,056
One more, you said, eh...?

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,516
Just when I thought you'd snuck out of
your hospital room

29
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,059
and were doing some training...

30
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,524
You guys want some, too?

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,529
Pop, here's the tab.

32
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,614
Thanks for your business!

33
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,784
Jeez, I'm fine!

34
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:43,330
Naruto, even if it looks like you've healed
on the surface, you're still battered.

35
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:50,170
It's not like that!
I have to train and get stronger!

36
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,382
Yeah-yeah,
after you've healed completely.

37
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:58,596
Damn it! I have to keep my promise
to Sakura without further delay...!

38
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,647
Sakura... You're so pathetic.

39
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:16,488
Naruto...This is a...
once in a lifetime request...

40
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,744
Please bring...
please bring Sasuke back.

41
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:32,421
I couldn't do it!
I wasn't able to stop Sasuke!

42
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,304
At this point, the only person who
would be able to stop Sasuke...

43
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,847
who would be able to save him...

44
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,144
Is you...Naruto...

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,571
All I did...was cry...
All I did was totally rely on Naruto.

46
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,032
I didn't do anything myself.

47
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:06,455
Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke
even if it meant his life...

48
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,474
What can I do for Sasuke now...?

49
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,188
I just have to put my life on the line
and do it!

50
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,573
It's futile. The ropes are made
of a maiden's black hair.

51
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,243
And the knot is a Shinobi
reverse butterfly knot.

52
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,495
It won't be easily untied.

53
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,081
Give me a break.

54
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:54,503
I have to start training as soon as possible
and get stronger.

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,509
Then do as the Medical Corps says
and rest quietly.

56
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,970
Come in.

57
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,934
Oh...

58
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,688
Sorry, Sakura...

59
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,691
I'd like to get moving immediately
if possible, but...

60
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,907
He has astonishing recuperative power,
but overdoing it is a big no-no.

61
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,160
6I'm okay!

62
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,120
Be a little more patient!

63
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:47,056
Just wait a little longer!
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

64
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,019
No...
It's okay...

65
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,065
Up until now,
I was totally reliant on you...

66
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,901
and I did nothing, so...

67
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,611
What's the matter, Sakura...?

68
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,071
Did something happen?!

69
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:06,909
No... I'm was relieved
to see you doing well.

70
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,220
This time, I'll do my best.

71
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,280
Sakura...?

72
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,865
I heard you snuck out of the hospital.

73
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,244
Do you want to train that badly?

74
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,539
Pervy Sage...? My...apple!

75
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,542
Well well, things look
like they're going smoothly.

76
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,002
Don't you worry.
I'll train you hard right away.

77
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,048
Umm...about the training.

78
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,967
I was wondering if you could
wait a little while longer.

79
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,179
Hmm?
I'm not saying I don't want to train.

80
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:14,309
But I remembered some
odds and ends I need to take care of.

81
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,061
Oh?

82
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,276
Odds and ends, huh?

83
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,237
Come on. Please?

84
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,460
Come in!

85
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,089
Oh, I've been spotted, huh?

86
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,592
I'm guessing, you want to peep?

87
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,261
No matter how long you wait,
I won't show anything.

88
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:54,099
Wh-Who'd peep at an old lady?!

89
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,060
N-No, I take that back!

90
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:03,692
Actually, I've come to make
an earnest request to you as the Hokage.

91
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,614
Talk.

92
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,007
This time, I'll do my best.

93
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,012
It couldn't be that Sakura's going to...

94
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,513
This might be...my last look...

95
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,228
Sakura...

96
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,606
How did you...?

97
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,241
I know what you're thinking!

98
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,327
That there'd be nothing
I could do even if I were to go...!

99
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,873
But I hate myself just standing here
doing nothing!

100
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:47,296
Always being a hindrance to
and taking advantage of everyone...

101
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,799
Not being able to do
one single thing respectably...

102
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,385
It's useless to stop me!

103
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,595
I won't stop you...

104
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,349
You should do it until you're satisfied.

105
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,728
But...I'm going, too.

106
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,688
But...

107
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,691
It's become just the two of us...

108
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,652
But we're a three-man squad, right?

109
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,325
Yeah.

110
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,911
You guys...

111
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,831
Oops! Pervy Sage?

112
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,464
This person...is Jiraiya,
one of the legendary Sannin?

113
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,050
If you, without permission,

114
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,052
go out past the border of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

115
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:40,640
you know at least that you'll be sent
to prison as Rogue Ninja, right?

116
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,809
It's no use stopping us!

117
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,855
I won't stop you.

118
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,194
You've been given a mission
by Lady Hokage.

119
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,238
You're to investigate and report
on the Land of Rice Paddies

120
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,867
where the Village Hidden in Sound is
and where Sasuke has been taken away.

121
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,829
The mission is set to be carried out
in a group of three.

122
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,667
As of now, you will work under me.
You got a problem?!

123
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,018
It seems they're the biggest of fools.

124
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,523
They won't stop even if you tried.

125
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,985
At this rate,
we'll lose two important subordinates!

126
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,240
You'll recognize it as a special mission

127
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,787
with the goal of investigating
the Village Hidden in Sound, right?

128
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,417
I have no choice, huh...?

129
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,130
But I have a condition.

130
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,800
Bring the two back alive. Got it?

131
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,971
Sure, even if it costs my life.

132
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,228
It's too dangerous of a mission even
with that Jiraiya going with them...

133
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,666
Sasuke...

134
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,684
That's the Land of Rice Paddies where
the Village Hidden in the Sound is.

135
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,480
It's that Orochimaru's headquarters.

136
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,149
Take sufficient caution and proceed.

137
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,864
It's kind of anticlimactic...

138
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,577
Here I thought a bunch of
Orochimaru's followers would greet us!

139
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,705
Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?

140
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,833
It seems to be a peaceful,
quiet and nice land, but...

141
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,922
No, we still haven't entered
Village Hidden in the Sound.

142
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,340
This is the Land of Rice Paddies.

143
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,925
Land of Rice Paddies?

144
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,219
It's a small land that's nothing special.

145
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,473
The feudal lord was a foolish lord who
hungered for powerful military strength

146
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,561
in order to make the land
disproportionately larger.

147
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:36,441
And then Orochimaru probably won favor
with some fast-talking...

148
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,321
Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn't
thinking about making the land stronger.

149
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:46,493
He just had an ambition to make himself
stronger and to carry out revenge...

150
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,623
That's why there's nothing in this area
that points to his presence.

151
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,167
Really? And so, Pervy Sage...!

152
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,920
Don't call me Pervy Sage!

153
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,465
That's right...
He's one of the legendary Sannin, so...

154
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:05,428
He's just a lady-loving
perverted Pervy Sage!

155
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,180
What?!

156
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,643
More importantly,
where's the Village Hidden in the Sound?

157
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,480
Beats me... I don't know...
What?!

158
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,776
We don't know where it is,
so we're going to investigate, right?

159
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,112
You've got a point, but...

160
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,406
But how do we find it?

161
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,577
There can't be a place where
people are without food and ladies.

162
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,330
People gather where
there's food and girls!

163
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,042
– Where people gather, there's news.
– There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.

164
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,337
He's planning to sow his wild oats
under the guise of a special mission.

165
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,424
First off, finding a traveler's town with
lots of hot ladies is the top priority!

166
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,636
Every land should have a traveler's town.

167
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,558
Lodging

168
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,481
This is a traveler's town...right?

169
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,318
Looks like nobody's living here anymore.

170
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,237
No, I feel the presence of people...

171
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,905
And the smell of face powder!

172
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,121
– Naruto, take it out.
– Take what out?

173
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,623
Don't act as you don't know!

174
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,000
In anything one does,
a war chest is necessary, right?

175
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,879
What! Are you after my wallet? Man!

176
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,928
What?! This shouldn't be it!
Try jumping!

177
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,263
Huh?!

178
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,933
No! Stop!

179
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,316
One, two, three... Is this all you got?

180
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,861
That's all of it, really!

181
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,780
– Here...
– Huh?

182
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,157
It's not much, but please use it.

183
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,744
No! Sakura, there's no need for
you to give that to him!

184
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,331
But, it's money for
gathering information, right?

185
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,708
Right-right. This should be enough.

186
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,257
You guys go on ahead to the outskirts
of the post station and wait!

187
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,343
Wh-Why?

188
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,305
It's too dangerous ahead from here.
It's a mission for adults.

189
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,544
Hmm, the smell of
face powder's from here.

190
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,760
Welcome...

191
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,596
Along came a sucker just begging
to be parted from his money.

192
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,182
We should be able to pulverize him.

193
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,565
Food and Drink! And young women!

194
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,284
Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,

195
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,204
he's just going to sow his oats without
gathering any information, anyway.

196
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,581
Sow his oats...?

197
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,209
Y-Yeah...
I don't really know about it, but...

198
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,587
You know, make-out blah-blah-blah...

199
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,424
It's fine!
If I can be of at least some help...

200
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,552
I'm always a hindrance
who can't do anything, so...

201
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,472
It's not like that!

202
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,891
In the first place,
if you hadn't taken the action...

203
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,353
I'd still be tied to the bed!

204
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,901
Brothel

205
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,323
Even in different lands,
there are young women everywhere.

206
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,117
So? Why don't we move to
the room in the back?

207
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,828
I want to talk more relaxed.

208
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,872
Nice, nice.

209
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,334
Then first, settle up the tab
for here, okay?

210
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,254
What, am I already drunk
on this cheap drink...?

211
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,965
Aren't there like three too many zeros?

212
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,802
You like to joke, do you?

213
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,026
If you value your life,
leave all you've got on you here.

214
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,489
I see how it is.

215
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,914
Master Jiraiya's late.

216
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,333
I'm sick of waiting.

217
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,088
Naruto!

218
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,721
Who's there?!

219
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,613
Who're you?!
Are you one of Orochimaru's followers?!

220
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,575
What? Was I wrong?!

221
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
Damn it.

222
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,498
That kid had erased his presence
until he'd gotten that close.

223
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,542
I won't let him get away!

224
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,420
Don't move!
Wh-Why?!

225
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,338
Makibishi Spikes!

226
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,718
Naruto!

227
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,137
Wh-What?!

228
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,777
– Hold it! You jerk!
– We won't let you get away!

229
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,155
Naruto, what's that?!

230
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,199
Pervy Sage? What did you do?!

231
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,952
I'll tell you later!
Anyway, let's get out of here!

232
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,412
Why?!

233
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,788
Companions of the person just now?

234
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:10,209
If they're Orochimaru's followers,
with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I'll...

235
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,546
No, no! Don't get the wrong idea!

236
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,550
They're just bodyguards from a rip-off bar!

237
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,802
R-Rip-off bar...?!

238
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:24,098
First and foremost, this mission has
to be carried out in strict secrecy!

239
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,768
There'd be no point if you were
to use Ninja Art and stand out!

240
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,814
You! Carry the bags!

241
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,526
The one who's totally standing out
is you, Pervy Sage!

242
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,029
You have a point.

243
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:43,701
This is wrong!
Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!

244
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,400
When I recalled the parts one by one,

245
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,864
I felt as though
I had understood everything

246
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,494
Faded words

247
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:32,583
which I kept so close to me

248
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:37,505
Speechless nights,

249
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,593
a hint of warmth

250
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:48,933
and this distant yearning for you

251
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,186
I live,

252
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,192
simply repeating this cycle

253
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,073
Held in my two hands

254
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:09,787
A droplet of time

255
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:17,795
Softly clutching forgotten memories

256
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,673
Lost words

257
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,144
I'll keep these thoughts...

258
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,942
Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.

259
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,694
Well, you guys wait here.

260
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,779
Huh? Why?!

261
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,114
Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!

262
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,284
It's too much for you youngsters.
Pervy Sage...

263
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:53,164
I myself should be the only sacrifice!
See ya, Naruto.

264
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,917
Blah-blah-blah, trying to look good...

265
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,796
Your scheme to go into
a weird shop again is totally obvious!

266
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,299
