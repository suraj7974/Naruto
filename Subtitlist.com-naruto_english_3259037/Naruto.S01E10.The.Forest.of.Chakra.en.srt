1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,511
C'mon!

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,681
♂̀

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,894
Running like a fugitive,

4
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

6
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,698
My throat dry like it's withering

7
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:35,369
For no single one,

8
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,789
To none does belong,

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,503
This time is ours, right now...

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,341
Unraveling the pain,

11
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,135
Unraveling our hearts,

12
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

13
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,807
Stifling our breath,

14
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,768
Reaching for beyond,

15
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,936
Tearing through the dark

16
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:09,862
In fighting and in love

17
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,532
To the distant light above,

18
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,119
Yes, we are on the way

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,459
I wanna rock...

20
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,254
Rockin' my heart

21
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,017
It seems I've overused my Sharingan...

22
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,938
Are you alright, Sensei?

23
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,275
Not really... It will be hard just to
move for about a week...

24
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,863
Well... It would be better if
you didn't move for a while.

25
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,114
O-Okay...

26
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,538
Hey! Sensei's awake.

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,665
Come on!

28
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,291
Your Sharingan is fantastic,

29
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,003
but if it puts that much of a strain
on your body, it may not be worth it!

30
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,505
S-Sorry...

31
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,298
But you know...

32
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,051
He did take down
a real powerful Ninja like that!

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,011
We probably don't need to
worry for a while.

34
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:20,516
Anyway, that kid with the mask...
What was he?

35
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,936
He was an ANBU black ops
from the Hidden Mist village.

36
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,814
It's a mask that the elite
Ninja Tracking Unit wears.

37
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,149
The elite Ninja Tracking Unit?

38
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,194
They're commonly called the
"fire extinguishing corps,"

39
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:37,116
and their duty is to erase all traces
that a Ninja ever lived.

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,951
The body of the Ninja reveals
a variety of things...

41
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:43,455
Ninjutsu secrets and Chakra characteristics
which permeate the Ninja of their village...

42
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,794
the composition of secret medicines
used on a Ninja's body...

43
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,506
For instance, if I were to die,

44
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,010
every secret about my Sharingan
would be investigated thoroughly,

45
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,512
and in the worst case,

46
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,724
there's a danger that
my entire Jutsu could be stolen.

47
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,018
In other words,
Tracker Ninja are specialists

48
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,563
that prevent village secrets
from leaking out

49
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,940
by killing Rogue Ninja
who've run away from their village,

50
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,862
and completely eliminating their bodies.

51
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:21,118
First, I'll cut the mouth cloth
and have him spit up blood...

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,955
It's alright.

53
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,750
I'll do it...myself...

54
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,462
What? You've already come back to life...

55
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,386
Darn, you really are rough...

56
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,306
You too, Zabuza.

57
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,352
Please don't pull them out
so violently or you really will die.

58
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,943
How long do you plan on keeping
that shady-looking mask on?!

59
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,110
Take it off!

60
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:01,784
It's a relic from the past,
and it's been handy for trickery...

61
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,626
But if I hadn't rescued you,
you certainly would have been killed.

62
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,586
If you were going to put me
into a state of apparent death,

63
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,673
you didn't need to aim for
the secret opening on my neck.

64
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,677
You're really a nasty one.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,804
It couldn't be helped...

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,393
Besides, I didn't want to mark up
your immaculate body.

67
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,313
And also, I can aim more accurately
on the point on the neck

68
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,399
where there's not much muscle.

69
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,321
You'll be numb for about a week
and won't be able to move.

70
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:44,660
But since you're Zabuza,
perhaps you'll soon be able to move...

71
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,792
You're so innocent, smart, and untainted...

72
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,254
That's what I like about you.

73
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,216
I am, after all, still a child.

74
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,095
The fog has lifted.

75
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,179
Yes.

76
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,350
Will you be alright the next time?

77
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,894
The next time...

78
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,148
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.

79
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,154
The Forest of Chakra

80
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,240
What is this?

81
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,701
Even though Zabuza is dead...

82
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,786
this indescribable uneasiness...

83
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,080
it must mean something very important...

84
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,543
I have a feeling
I've overlooked something.

85
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,921
What's going on?! Sensei?

86
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,508
What? Oh...so to continue my earlier story...

87
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,761
Ninja trackers...

88
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,473
take care of the bodies of people they've
killed, immediately and on the spot.

89
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,433
So what about that?

90
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,354
What did that kid with
the mask do with Zabuza?

91
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,275
How should we know?!

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,153
That masked one took Zabuza away!

93
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,530
That's right...

94
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,452
If he needed proof he'd killed Zabuza,
he could simply have taken the head...

95
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,788
And the question is...

96
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:15,209
the weapon the Ninja tracker kid
used to kill Zabuza...

97
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,711
A regular Senbon...

98
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,922
That's impossible...

99
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,925
Right...it's impossible?!

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,888
What have you guys
been clamoring on and on about?!

101
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,892
It's probably that... Zabuza is alive!

102
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,895
What?

103
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,064
What the heck do you mean?!

104
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,859
But Kakashi Sensei,
you made sure that he was dead!

105
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,320
It's true, I did make sure...

106
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,117
But, he was probably just in
a state of near-death.

107
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:57,417
The Senbon that Tracker Ninja used has
a very low ability to kill

108
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,795
unless it hits a vital spot...

109
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,173
It's something that was originally used
for medical treatments

110
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,259
such as acupuncture therapy.

111
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,304
Ninja trackers know all about
the structure of the human body...

112
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,226
putting people into a state of apparent
near-death is probably simple for them.

113
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,397
First, he went to the trouble of
taking Zabuza's corpse

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,691
which was probably heavier than he is.

115
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,488
Second, he used a Senbon,
a weapon with a low ability to kill.

116
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,032
From these two factors,

117
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:34,663
that youth wasn't aiming to
kill Zabuza but to save him.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,666
Aren't you reading way too much into it?

119
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,917
No...

120
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,630
If something seems fishy,
make preparations before it's too late.

121
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,591
That's also an iron clad rule
of the Shinobi!

122
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,643
Humph... To hear that Zabuza
may be alive and to be pleased...

123
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,147
Sensei, what do we do to make preparations
before it's too late?

124
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,482
You won't even be able
to move for a while...

125
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll assign you training!

126
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,744
W-Wait a minute! Even with training,
we're not gonna be that strong!

127
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,957
Our opponent is a Ninja whom even you,
with the Sharingan, had a tough fight with!

128
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,710
Are you trying to kill us?!

129
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,337
Sakura...

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,298
Who was it that saved me
during my difficult battle?

131
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,053
You've all quickly grown...
especially Naruto!

132
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,890
You've grown the most!

133
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,606
He clearly does seem somewhat
stronger than before, but...

134
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:47,819
So you noticed, Kakashi Sensei!
Now it's getting interesting!

135
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,988
It's not interesting at all...

136
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,246
Who the heck are you?

137
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,499
Hey, Inari! Where've you been?!

138
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,209
Welcome back...Grandpa...

139
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,878
Inari, what sort of greeting is that?!

140
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,131
These are the Ninja
who escorted your grandpa!

141
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,134
It's okay, it's okay. Right, Inari?

142
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,601
Mom, these guys will die...

143
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,562
There's no way they can
oppose Gato and win.

144
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,773
Say what, you little brat!

145
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,109
Now listen up!

146
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,611
I'm a super hero who's gonna become
an awesome Ninja

147
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,779
named Hokage in the future!

148
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,407
I don't know if it's Gato or
Chocolat or whatever...

149
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,285
I'm not worried about those guys, at all!

150
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:41,748
Huh, a hero. That's ridiculous!
There's no such thing!

151
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,917
W-What did you say?!

152
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,210
Stop that!

153
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,714
If you don't want to die,
you'd better hurry up and go home...

154
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,428
Inari, where're you going?

155
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,223
The sea... I'll be looking at the sea...

156
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,604
I apologize.

157
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,734
Shucks!

158
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,196
That brat... I need to tell him
a thing or two!

159
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,953
Huh?

160
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,331
Is he crying?!

161
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,054
D-Dad...

162
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,485
So, now the training begins!

163
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,569
Yes, sir!

164
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,821
So...before that,

165
00:10:54,905 --> 00:11:00,035
let me again explain
Chakra power for a Ninja, from the basics.

166
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,411
At this point...

167
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:05,248
Of course we know about that!
Chatora, right?

168
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,000
It's Chakra...

169
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,795
Yes, Sakura...?

170
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,505
Are you listening, Naruto?!

171
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,132
It's tiresome, so I'll explain it simply!

172
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:21,848
Chakra is energy that
a Ninja needs when he uses a Jutsu!

173
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,767
It's made up of two energies:

174
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,730
1) Physical energy gathered together
from each and every cell in the body and

175
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:35,570
2) Spiritual energy accumulated based
on numerous trainings and experiences!

176
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,324
In other words, Jutsu wrings out and
combines these two energies

177
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,576
from within the body,

178
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,996
and this is called "combining the Chakra."

179
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,043
Then Chakra is activated
by forming hand "signs."

180
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,712
That's exactly right!

181
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:56,174
Iruka Sensei really does
have good students.

182
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:02,013
Whatever! I may not understand
difficult explanations,

183
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,807
but I'll just learn it with my body!

184
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,809
Naruto is absolutely right...

185
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,603
We're already able to use Jutsu...

186
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:13,066
No! All of you still haven't used
Chakra efficiently.

187
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,526
What?!

188
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,695
Hold on and listen...

189
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,488
As Sakura explained earlier,

190
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:23,577
combining Chakra means picking up
both the physical and spiritual energies

191
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,787
and mixing them together within the body.

192
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:32,711
And of course the amount of each energy,
the preparation of the energy,

193
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,338
changes based on
the Jutsu you want to activate...

194
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,301
All of you at present aren't
using Chakra efficiently!

195
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,805
Even if you're able to combine
a lot of Chakra,

196
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,308
if you're not able to control it
in a balanced way

197
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,978
the effectiveness of the Jutsu
not only will be cut in half

198
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,272
but it may not even be activated at all.

199
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,193
Wasting energy will prevent you from
battling for long periods.

200
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,237
These are some of
the weaknesses that can occur.

201
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,823
W-What should we do...?

202
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,869
You need to learn to control
the Chakra with your body!

203
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,665
It's difficult training that requires you
to put your life on the line to master!

204
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,294
W-What will we do?

205
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,379
Hm?

206
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,006
Tree-climbing...

207
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,841
Tree-climbing?!

208
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:20,967
That's right.

209
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,720
But it's not just simple tree-climbing!

210
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,680
You will climb without using your hands.

211
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,682
What? How?

212
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,645
Well! Just watch.

213
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,954
He's climbing...

214
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,374
Perpendicular to the tree
and with his feet!

215
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,337
So see, kind of like this...

216
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,800
Focus the Chakra on the bottoms of your feet
and make them stick to the tree trunk.

217
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,428
If you use Chakra well,
you can do things like this.

218
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,763
Wait a minute!

219
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,516
How does something like that
make you strong?

220
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,977
So this is the main point...

221
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,437
The aim of this training is to accumulate

222
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,441
the required amount of combined Chakra
to the required spot...

223
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,404
This is surprisingly difficult
even for an expert Ninja.

224
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,199
The amount of Chakra used
for tree-climbing is very subtle.

225
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:32,372
And the bottoms of the feet are
the most difficult place to gather Chakra.

226
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,334
Anyway! In other words,
if you master that control

227
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:41,798
it will be possible to master
any Jutsu. In theory, that is!

228
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,261
The second aim is to maintain
that combined Chakra.

229
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,390
Ninja combine the most Chakra
during battles.

230
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,225
Under such situations,

231
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,187
"control" and "maintenance"
of Chakra becomes most difficult.

232
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:01,985
So anyway, nothing's really gonna
happen with me saying this and that...

233
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,488
You'll need to learn it with your bodies

234
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,703
Use that Kunai to put a mark at the spot

235
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,623
where you can climb up to
under your own strength now.

236
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:20,420
Next make an effort to
put a mark further from it.

237
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,091
You aren't good enough to
walk up from the start,

238
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:30,138
so run and use your momentum
to get used to it... You got it?!

239
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,019
This training is nothing!
Hah, it's too easy for me!

240
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,231
After all, I'm the man
who's grown the most!

241
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:44,194
Enough with the talk...
Now get to it. Try climbing any tree.

242
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:50,325
OK, so first I need to gather
the Chakra on the bottoms of my feet...

243
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,671
Ready!! Here I go!

244
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:22,190
I didn't think it'd be this difficult to
maintain a constant amount of Chakra...

245
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,484
If the Chakra is too strong
you get pushed back...

246
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:31,408
But if the Chakra is too weak,
there's no sticking power and that happens.

247
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,205
Well...! The difference between Naruto
and Sasuke seems about right.

248
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,915
This is pretty easy!

249
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,044
S-Sakura!

250
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,510
So, it looks like the one with the best control

251
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,722
of the Chakra is Sakura, the girl...

252
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,561
Wow! Way to go, Sakura!

253
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,604
Just what you'd expect from
the girl I set my sights on!

254
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,440
But it does sort of tick me off!

255
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,899
Whatever!

256
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,027
I wanted Sasuke to notice me...

257
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,405
Why does this always happen?!

258
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,491
Well, not only does Sakura have
knowledge about Chakra,

259
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,828
her control and stamina are pretty good.

260
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,371
It looks like...

261
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:23,877
She might be the closest one to
becoming a Hokage...unlike someone else.

262
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,339
And also, the Uchiha Clan
isn't really that great...

263
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,508
Shut up Sensei!

264
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,470
Sasuke won't like me then!

265
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,893
Having said that... Naruto and Sasuke...

266
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,854
Those two have an incredible amount
of Chakra hidden in them...

267
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,731
that Sakura can't even match!

268
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,694
If this training goes well,
this will become an asset to them...

269
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,281
OK! First I'll catch up to Sasuke!

270
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,657
I'll do it...for sure!

271
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,289
Whatever!

272
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,793
Even if they do that, it's just a waste...

273
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,483
Unbelievable...

274
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,610
Even you got beaten and had to come back?

275
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,488
The Ninja from the Hidden Mist Village
look like total weaklings!

276
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,865
You can't even clean up after
your subordinates,

277
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,992
and you think you're a "demon"!
Don't make me laugh!

278
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,793
So they're drawing swords...

279
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,296
Hold on. Wait.

280
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,217
Hey... There's no need to stay silent!

281
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,679
Why don't you say something?

282
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,852
Don't touch Zabuza with your dirty hands!

283
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,521
I-It's gonna break...!

284
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,945
N-No way...

285
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,905
He moved...in an instant...

286
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,368
I wouldn't do that... I'm ticked off!!

287
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,041
Next time... If you lose again next time...

288
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,711
remember that there'll be
no place for you here!

289
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,380
I'm leaving!

290
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,596
Haku... Such unnecessary actions...

291
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,306
I know...

292
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,561
But it's too early to take down
Gato right now...

293
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,022
If we make trouble here...

294
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,444
We'll be pursued by them again.

295
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,863
We must restrain ourselves for now.

296
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,866
Yeah...

297
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,910
You're right.

298
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,293
Ohhhhh...

299
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
Ou–ch!!

300
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,389
I'm totally worn out!

301
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,017
How much stamina can those two have?

302
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,902
But Naruto isn't getting
any better at all.

303
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,030
He'll soon give up and
start throwing a tantrum.

304
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:41,991
Shoot!

305
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:46,120
See! He sure is an easy one to figure out!

306
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,873
Hey, Sakura!

307
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,959
Can you give me some tips?

308
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,293
What?

309
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,754
Let's keep it a secret from Sasuke!
Come on, come on.

310
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,679
He's getting stronger and stronger...
How strong will he get...?

311
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,639
At any rate Naruto...

312
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:09,143
the amount of your dormant Chakra
is probably more than Sasuke's.

313
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,565
And it's even more than mine!

314
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,027
I look forward to it... I really do.

315
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,711
That Inari...
He was crying all by himself.

316
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,380
He was looking at the sea
and crying the entire time.

317
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,010
He's always crying all alone.

318
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,386
