1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,346
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,270
One more time

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,776
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,492
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,912
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:41,000
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,336
I wake up

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,301
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:02,021
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,691
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,028
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,915
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,880
One more time

23
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,470
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru.

24
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,889
He'll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,141
What do you mean by a mission?

26
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,268
Be careful...

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,232
It's the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,572
Ouch!

29
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,325
You were able to release
the Genjutsu too!

30
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,494
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!

31
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,122
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!

32
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,167
Then await next orders
in a safe place.

33
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,128
Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!

34
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,130
I'll tell you the reason en route!

35
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,216
Let's go!

36
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,343
H-Hey!

37
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,034
I get it! So that's what happened!

38
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,037
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

39
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,583
So, why am I pulled into this?

40
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,418
This is such a drag!

41
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,712
It can't be helped!

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,172
It's Kakashi Sensei's order.

43
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,386
This way!

44
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,849
How long will it be until
we catch up?

45
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,811
I don't know.
He is moving at a pretty good speed.

46
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,771
Dang it!

47
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:16,447
A Shirker's Call to Action:
Layabout No More!

48
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,306
Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,891
Huh? What is it?

50
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,644
-Did you find Sasuke?
-No!

51
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,688
There are eight people in
two squads behind us...

52
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,231
No...

53
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,568
There's one more...
There are nine people following us.

54
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:55,819
What?!

55
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,365
C'mon. Already?!
Give me a break!

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
It looks they haven't grasped
our location, yet.

57
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,269
We must lose them.

58
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,074
Hey, what's the point of stopping?!

59
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,535
Shut up and follow me!

60
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,911
Huh?

61
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,124
We're going back over our footprints.

62
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,875
If we do that,

63
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,919
it'll look to them like our footprints
suddenly disappeared.

64
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,924
But,

65
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:03,178
they'll notice even
if we do this, right?

66
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:07,307
It'll buy us some time.
That's enough.

67
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,769
It'll be a matter for great celebration

68
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,896
if our pursuers get impatient,

69
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,650
cloud their eyes of pursuit
and lose sight of the trail.

70
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,987
Hurry!

71
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,865
There's no time.

72
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,242
I-I know!

73
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,643
This is not good.

74
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,521
Though they're on
alert for ambushes,

75
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,315
they're catching up with us
slowly, but surely.

76
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,816
Dang it!

77
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,694
Probably they're all Chunin or higher.

78
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,447
We'll be wiped out if they catch up.

79
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,365
Wiped out...

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,745
Dang it! Since it's come to this,
why don't we ambush them?!

81
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,288
Ambush?

82
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,748
Right.

83
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,085
Indeed, an ambush would
be to our advantage.

84
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,338
Even if the opponent has twice
the people than we do,

85
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,507
if we just catch them off-guard...

86
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,300
That's no good.

87
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,596
Our opponents are former
Leaf Shinobi Orochimaru's henchmen.

88
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:31,225
In the worst case scenario,
there might be Jonin.

89
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,021
I thought it'd work,
but I guess not, huh.

90
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,232
Hold it. Why?

91
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,152
The level of opponent doesn't have
much to do with an ambush.

92
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,279
What do you mean?

93
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,491
You guys don't get it.

94
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,034
Listen.

95
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,830
Indeed, an ambush is
a very advantageous fundamental tactic.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,125
But two conditions are necessary.

97
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,461
What are those necessary conditions?

98
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,629
Number one.

99
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,507
The ones on the run must act

100
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,551
without making noise
and find the enemy first.

101
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,886
Number two.

102
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,097
One must be able to catch
the pursuers off guard,

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,351
capture a point and position
to be able to inflict certain damage,

104
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,311
and conceal oneself quickly.

105
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,272
Ah... Huh?

106
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,108
An ambush only becomes effective

107
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,443
when these two conditions are ensured.

108
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,157
Well, the first condition
won't be so difficult

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,117
since we have the Ninja Hound's nose.

110
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,246
And the second one also
seems advantageous at a glance

111
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,791
since we know the geography
of our village.

112
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,545
But Orochimaru has spent time
in the Leaf before.

113
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,506
That approach won't work
on his henchmen.

114
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,509
So what do you really mean?

115
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,679
Our pursuers must have been instructed
in the terrain of this village

116
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,725
and have gone through
simulated practice for this fight.

117
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,103
And on top of that,
they're probably all Ninja

118
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,022
who have mastered the pursuit arts.

119
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,983
So they know what cards we have, huh.

120
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,404
Well, even so, the fact remains
that an ambush is advantageous.

121
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,531
But there are too many elements
of uncertainty.

122
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,408
In the first place,

123
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,412
the enemy is
a special unit organized for this operation.

124
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,415
But we have a fool...

125
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,001
a Kunoichi who's nothing special...

126
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,253
and one dog...

127
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,382
and, me with the number-one cold feet!

128
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,095
A tactic is grasping the conditions
that are there without fail

129
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,847
and formulating an optimal plan.

130
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,936
And so, there's only one thing
that we can do now...

131
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,230
One?

132
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,024
A diversion in the guise
of an ambush.

133
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,694
One person will remain,
pretend to ambush,

134
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,529
and delay the pursuers.

135
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,324
In other words...

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,326
bait.

137
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,495
Right.

138
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,997
If we delay them,

139
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,375
they won't be able to grasp
the positions of the remaining three.

140
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,962
If we do that, we'll be able
to shake off our pursuers,

141
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,922
but the one who has become
the bait will probably...

142
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885
die.

143
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,128
So, who's going to do it?

144
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,970
We need the dog to follow Sasuke.

145
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,139
That means...

146
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,564
Fine...

147
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,317
– I'll...
– I guess it has to be me.

148
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,776
Shikamaru?!

149
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,486
W-Why you?!

150
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,032
It's better than being wiped out, right?

151
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,117
Besides, among us,

152
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,494
the only one who is equal
to playing the bait

153
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,331
and who has the possibility
of surviving...

154
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,835
is me.

155
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,382
Shadow Possession Jutsu

156
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,676
is an Art
originally intended as a delay tactic, so...

157
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,013
Well, I'll catch up later!

158
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,015
Now get going!

159
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,647
We're counting on you, Shikamaru!

160
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,818
Sakura!

161
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,199
Yeah.

162
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,127
Was Shikamaru ever this reliable
of a character?

163
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,674
Be careful...

164
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
Shikamaru.

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,833
No matter how much you try to erase
the signs of your presence...

166
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,837
you're in plain view.

167
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,719
Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.

168
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,012
What did you say?!

169
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,224
I wonder if he's really
delaying the enemy.

170
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,687
Me with the number-one cold feet!

171
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't tell me, Shikamaru...

172
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,401
Shikamaru will be okay!

173
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,112
Don't tell me, he ran away.

174
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,823
I said he'll be okay!

175
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,949
What'll be okay?!

176
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,202
He has a dirty mouth and
always says stuff is a pain.

177
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,371
But he wouldn't betray us!

178
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,043
He hardly ever says
he'll do something himself,

179
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,129
but he makes sure to do it
if he says it!

180
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,506
That's absolute.

181
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,968
I want to believe...
I want to believe, but...

182
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,929
Pick up the pace!

183
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,357
I somehow managed to
get away completely.

184
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,865
Their strides are irregular.

185
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,202
Urgency is probably increasing
their fatigue.

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,841
Sorry about that.

187
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,595
I was supposed to be the guy
with the number one cold feet.

188
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,017
It seems my character has
changed just a bit this time.

189
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,979
The fact that I'm tired is true.

190
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,856
Those footprints are wrong.

191
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,945
By the way, this is what
the dog's paw print really is.

192
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,625
Oh, he's still a kid.

193
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,211
To think we'd all get caught like this.

194
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,674
So this is the rumored Leaf Village's
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?

195
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,302
That's an old way of saying it!

196
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,138
The times are passing!

197
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,892
It's called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,
old man.

198
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,899
Sure enough,
that match wasn't good.

199
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,035
I used too much Chakra.

200
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,496
I can't hang on much longer...

201
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,795
1, 2, 3, 4...

202
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:43,300
5, 6, 7...8.

203
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
Eight people...

204
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,722
Eight... No, there's one more...

205
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,765
There are nine people following us.

206
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,935
Sure enough,

207
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,813
the ninth person's role is
to protect against them getting ambushed.

208
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,316
That person stays at a fixed distance,

209
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,736
moves in the back and responds
to an enemy attack.

210
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,620
But...

211
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,874
this will make clear where
that person's hiding!

212
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,390
There, huh?!

213
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,023
Dang it... The Shadow won't reach.

214
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,942
I don't have the stamina to
send it to Chakra.

215
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,697
It's futile. I see through your technique.

216
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,160
Is this as far as it goes?

217
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,205
It looks like you're at your limit...

218
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,999
This Shadow Possession Jutsu
is going to break very soon.

219
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,751
Prepare yourself!

220
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,974
I wanted to...
become a Ninja any which way,

221
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,601
save up money any which way,

222
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,270
get married any which way to
an ordinary woman

223
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,939
who's neither beautiful nor ugly

224
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,400
and have two kids any which way.

225
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,820
First will be a girl, and then a boy...

226
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,030
I would retire from being a Ninja

227
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,367
when my eldest daughter marries
and my son becomes a full-fledged man.

228
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,538
And then I take it easy
in my life of retirement

229
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,707
playing Japanese chess
and Go the whole day.

230
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,085
Then I die of old age before my wife.

231
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,505
Such a life would've been nice.

232
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,258
I was out of character,
I tried too hard this time.

233
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,593
I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.

234
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,931
What I did was a drag...

235
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,146
Hmm, the movements of
our pursuers have stopped.

236
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,442
Yes! The delaying was a success!

237
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,318
Shikamaru, eh?

238
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,281
I'm sorry I doubted you, even a little.

239
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,241
Okay!

240
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,162
Now...you wait, Sasuke.

241
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,207
And...Shikamaru...

242
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,335
Live, and catch up to us no matter what!

243
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,842
As you say, it seems I'm at my limit.

244
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,772
Hey, come on out.

245
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,529
While you're at it, cut off his head.

246
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,589
I finally caught up.

247
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,133
A-Asuma?! Why?

248
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,609
Well done, Shikamaru.

249
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,491
Sure enough, out of character.

250
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,954
For the time being, you retire here.

251
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,919
Hurry!

252
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,177
What a pest.

253
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,809
The pursuers have increased?
Two? No, three?

254
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,353
Kankuro! Pick up the pace!

255
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,105
Okay.

256
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,448
I won't let you get away.

257
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,204
Don't jump the gun, Sasuke.

258
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,124
Sasuke.

259
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,092
Now then, shall we begin?

260
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,728
Everyone makes mistakes

261
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:15,984
It's nothing to be ashamed about

262
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:21,239
Don't let this scar be for naught

263
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:27,120
Walk with a smile

264
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,882
Yes, breathe in the air

265
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,552
Lift your face to the sky and jump

266
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,513
If it rains, take a break

267
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,974
Go where the wind takes you

268
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,601
So many regrets

269
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,104
Don't let this scar be for naught

270
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,481
Let's go carve the badges in our chest

271
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,109
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

272
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:03,406
Everyone makes mistakes

273
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:08,661
It's nothing to be ashamed about

274
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:13,958
Don't let this scar be for naught

275
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,213
Walk with a smile

276
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:24,469
Transform sadness into the wind

277
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:29,766
and continue to forge on

278
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:35,563
Forge on strong

279
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,703
I don't know what's going on!

280
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,331
Why is Old Man Hokage
fighting with Orochimaru?

281
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,833
Why is Sasuke going after
that guy with shadows around his eyes?

282
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,585
I don't understand

283
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,295
why we have
to go after him,

284
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,256
but that's what we have to do right now!

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,634
Wait up, Sasuke!

286
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:09,013
Next time: "An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!"

287
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,974
What the heck's happening
to the village?!
