1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,837
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,887
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,743
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,495
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,999
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,420
have also been lost.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,776
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,656
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,329
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,640
Wait, Naruto!

17
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,475
I won't wait.

18
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,394
I told you not to be acting
on your own.

19
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,105
Then you're saying to
leave Sumaru be?!

20
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,400
Sumaru just now seemed
quite upset...

21
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,363
He's definitely intending to
get revenge on Akahoshi.

22
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,074
Now that he's been tarred with
the reputation of Rogue Ninja,

23
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,617
he'll have no place to go
throughout his life

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,577
if he raises a hand against
the village leader.

25
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,998
Hokuto?

26
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,948
Mother!

27
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,416
I finally...
Here, I finally got to meet you...

28
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,964
Mother.

29
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,931
The Star's Radiance

30
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,070
Wh-What're you doing?

31
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,281
Don't be acting on
your own anymore.

32
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,742
But, something's strange.

33
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,704
This number of Ninja is
indeed something serious.

34
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,582
It seems they've mobilized all
of the village Ninja.

35
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,960
Anyway, we should see
how things go for a little while.

36
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,757
Byakugan!

37
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,769
Sumaru's inside the training room...

38
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,188
Hey, what about Sumaru's mom?

39
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,315
Damn it!

40
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:55,736
Sumaru...

41
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,739
Do we really have to do away
with him?

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,284
He's still a kid.
Wouldn't it be okay to let things slide?

43
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,828
At this moment,
he's a dangerous element.

44
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,247
No good would come
of letting him live.

45
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,126
But Sumaru's been
the most effective Genin in the village.

46
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,713
We have more than
enough materials...

47
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,465
We can just train more...

48
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,675
Materials...?!

49
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,220
I won't stand for it anymore!
Leave it to me!

50
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,721
– Forget about it.
– Let go of me!

51
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,057
I'm going to kick
that Akahoshi jerk's butt.

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,309
This is a Star Village issue.

53
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,270
Village issues have to be resolved
by those in the village.

54
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,898
Isn't there something
we can do for him?

55
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,149
That's right.

56
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,319
Let's charge on in and
box Akahoshi's ears...

57
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,737
What're you saying?

58
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,698
That'd be the same as Naruto!

59
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,783
Are you saying we must
remain idle spectators

60
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,410
even when things have gone this far?!

61
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,536
That's right!

62
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,790
As long as there's no commission from
the village to kick Akahoshi's butt,

63
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,542
there's nothing we can do.

64
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,461
Archer unit! Forward!

65
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,263
Fire!

66
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:12,396
Until now, I felt resentment towards you,
Mother, for leaving me behind.

67
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,155
But...I understand clearly now.

68
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,867
I understand why you
had to do that.

69
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:29,288
Akahoshi... I will never forgive him!

70
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,044
Sumaru...

71
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,941
Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!

72
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,445
What're you talking about...?

73
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:06,909
I buried them both together...
There is no greater happiness.

74
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,378
Incredible Chakra!

75
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,972
Wait!

76
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,351
This jerk's an enemy...
He suddenly attacked.

77
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,731
You're Leaf Shinobi, right?

78
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,737
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround...

79
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,449
The people from other lands
are all after the star.

80
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,535
If you have that power,

81
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,703
you can stand above all of
the Hidden Villages.

82
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,707
Is your awesome Chakra also
the power of the star?

83
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,335
If they had that star,

84
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,295
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?

85
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,590
No! The more tremendous the power,

86
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,968
the more hard work is required
to control it!

87
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,846
I'll work hard, work hard, work hard!

88
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,764
I'll become the Hoshikage!

89
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,433
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!

90
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,938
I'm also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!

91
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,233
You're a strange guy.

92
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,734
Really?

93
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,739
That red star sure is pretty...

94
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,408
Natsuhiboshi...

95
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,162
It watches over me all the time...

96
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,499
Are you still gonna say
I should bear it after all this?

97
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,468
Sumaru!

98
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,354
Sumaru...

99
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,818
Listen, everyone.

100
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,031
If you continue the star training,
you'll all die.

101
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,703
Sumaru's mother is the one
who took away the star.

102
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,957
She did that in order to
protect everyone's lives!

103
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,667
Lord Akahoshi?

104
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,920
Is it true that we'll die?

105
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:30,719
Are you going to believe
such nonsense?!

106
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,263
Being unable to withstand
the star training

107
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,432
is because the heart that loves
the village is weak!

108
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,565
Those who really love the village
can become true Shinobi

109
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,528
and can also surpass the Hidden Villages
of the Five Great Nations!

110
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:53,242
Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi...
Who's telling the truth?

111
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,794
Mizura?!

112
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,879
In that condition...!
It's reckless!

113
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,591
Wait, everyone!

114
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:18,308
There's... There's something
I want everyone to see.

115
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:22,854
Mizura...

116
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,278
What's that?

117
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,946
What's going on?

118
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,573
Is that the effect of the training?

119
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,534
How awful.

120
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,497
Lord Akahoshi... I take pride in
the Hidden Star Village.

121
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,668
Even though it was painful,

122
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,962
I endured it and continued
the star training...

123
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,342
Even so, were my feelings for
the village still not enough?

124
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,012
Mizura!

125
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:59,266
I don't think there could be lies
in that child's words...and body.

126
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:05,105
Yes. So that's why
the Third Hoshikage prohibited

127
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,732
the star training for a long while.

128
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:11,570
We adults got carried away with
our feelings for the village

129
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,155
and may have made the wrong choice...

130
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,699
You loser!

131
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,744
Do you intend to mislead everyone
and crush the village?!

132
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,375
What're you doing, Akahoshi?!

133
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,336
They aren't traitors.

134
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,171
They're children of our village!

135
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,468
Protect Hokuto and Mizura.

136
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,388
Are you going to betray the village?!

137
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:43,518
I can't go along with your way
of doing things, Lord Akahoshi!

138
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,772
Me, too.
Me, too!

139
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,733
Me, too.
Me, too.

140
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,615
Death to those who betray the village!

141
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,450
Execute them all!

142
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,452
Are you insane, Akahoshi?

143
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,164
If we lost all the children,
there'd be no future for the village!

144
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,793
H-Hey...
You're taking things too far, Akahoshi.

145
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,504
Take everyone's feelings into
consideration and yield for now.

146
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,257
Shut up!
What're you doing talking nice now?

147
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,594
We've long since dirtied our hands.

148
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,138
S-Stop! What're you going to say?

149
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,724
Akahoshi, what do you mean?

150
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,312
There's a star in this village that
no other villages possess.

151
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,982
I just thought we didn't need
a foolish village leader

152
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,818
who wouldn't allow the star to be used.

153
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,569
What?!

154
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,072
Could it be that you are the ones who
killed the Third Hoshikage?!

155
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,576
Indeed, there were suspicious rumors
concerning the Third Hoshikage's death.

156
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,664
Akahoshi, prepare yourself
and answer!

157
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,999
You'll pay depending on your answer.

158
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:54,214
The three of us assassinated
the Third Hoshikage!

159
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,217
It was the quickest way
to save the village.

160
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,552
Say what?!

161
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,137
You guys are the traitors!

162
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,680
– Right!
– Right! Right!

163
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,932
No, don't get the wrong idea.

164
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,309
We just helped a little.

165
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,770
Idiot. That'll be an acknowledgement!

166
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,188
Akahoshi!

167
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,400
We will not acknowledge you
as leader of the village.

168
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,819
Justice is not with you anymore.

169
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,405
It is the children who possess the hearts
that truly care about the village.

170
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,368
Everyone! Let us rise together
with those children

171
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,537
for the sake of the village.

172
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,289
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

173
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,587
We're sorry, children.

174
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,341
We were completely taken in
by Akahoshi's fast-talk.

175
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,595
As of now, we'll fight with you!

176
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,432
Give it up, Akahoshi.

177
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,058
We've lost!

178
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,895
Shut up! I haven't lost.

179
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,027
Mizura!

180
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,948
Hokuto... Live for me...

181
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,575
Mizura!

182
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,371
Akahoshi, we won't let you do as
you please anymore!

183
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,334
I won't let you do something
like go against me!

184
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,336
Have you gone mad?!

185
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,671
Akahoshi, you've lost!

186
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,048
Give in to justice with good grace!

187
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,927
I won't lose!

188
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,348
The star is now...in my hands!

189
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,891
The star?!

190
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,730
I will now become
the Fourth Hoshikage!

191
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,770
Power... I'm starting to brim
with power.

192
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,022
I do not need any training.

193
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,819
I could have become one with
the star if I'd done this from the start..

194
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,741
What...What's this?

195
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,916
What's that?!

196
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,252
Byakugan.

197
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,429
Massive Chakra from the star has
poured into his Chakra Network

198
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,930
and is causing it to go out of control.

199
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,593
Hokuto!

200
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,534
I can't take it anymore!
Neji! Hey, Neji!

201
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,496
Don't... Naruto...

202
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,708
No matter what you say,
I'll kick that Akahoshi jerk's butt!

203
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,714
You jerk. I won't be responsible.

204
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,927
Right. Just say that I butt in on my own.

205
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,476
L-Lord Akahoshi.

206
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,066
Akahoshi!

207
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,160
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

208
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,047
Damn it!

209
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,138
You jerk.

210
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,569
Damn you...

211
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,363

00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,787
Damn you, Natsuhi!

235
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,894
Despite having been assigned
a mission to protect the star,

236
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,814
to think you'd smash
the all-important star...

237
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,608
You didn't just fail to complete
the mission!

238
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,861
The compensation fee
will be massive.

239
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,657
But Grandma, I had no other choice!

240
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,703
It's my fault as the leader for
not being able to stop him.

241
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,329
I'm responsible as well!

242
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,123
Right. I also...

243
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,709
Well, that'd be a matter
under normal circumstances.

244
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,838
We haven't received complaints
from the Star Village

245
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,882
with regard to the incident of
the star being smashed.

246
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,802
In fact, the culprit of this incident

247
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,556
was the client Akahoshi,
the deputy Hoshikage.

248
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,641
So the mission itself is forgotten!

249
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,644
Come to think of it,
what happened to him?

250
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,229
It seems the three,

251
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,524
the main culprit Akahoshi and
accomplices Yotaka and Shisou,

252
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,236
will be punished severely
by Hidden Star Village!

253
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,366
That's good! Now the Star Village
will be peaceful.

254
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,077
Come in.

255
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,249
Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from
the Star Village have been examined.

256
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,417
And...?

257
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,338
If they all receive proper treatment,
they will return to good health.

258
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,464
Hey, what about Mizura?

259
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,008
Yes. That boy will also be fine.

260
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,969
Yes! So, where's everyone?

261
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,847
They've completed their examinations
and are heading for their quarters.

262
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,684
Hey, Naruto! The lecture isn't...

263
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,646
He never changes.

264
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,861
Hey, guys.

265
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,073
That's great! Get better, Mizura.

266
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,574
Right!

267
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,535
I won't lose to you.
Huh, what?!

268
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,789
I'll become Hoshikage before you!

269
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,666
Even without the power of the star,

270
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,962
I'll make the Village Hidden in the Stars
into a most powerful Ninja village!

271
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,588
Say what?

272
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,509
No way will I lose!
I'll become Hokage before you!

273
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,135
Shut up. I'll be first.

274
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,637
I'll be first, believe it!

275
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:16,526
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

276
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:23,366
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

277
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,589
Yellow Moon.

278
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:45,513
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

279
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:50,685
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

280
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:57,650
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

281
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:04,532
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

282
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:11,247
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

283
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:18,004
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

284
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:25,053
A magical chord change, in a restless city

285
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:32,101
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

286
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,776
Kiba Inuzuka escaped with Akamaru!

287
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,943
Kiba did?!

288
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,614
Then, have a Special Pursuit Corps
stand by in preparation for the worst.

289
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,492
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, just a minute. Then they'll...

290
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,659
We have no choice.

291
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,578
The safety of the residents
must take precedence.

292
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,039
But Akamaru is Kiba's partner.

293
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,707
I'm aware of that.
Then...

294
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,920
Shut up, Naruto! I have an obligation
to protect this village.

295
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,673
Next time: "Kiba's Long Day."
