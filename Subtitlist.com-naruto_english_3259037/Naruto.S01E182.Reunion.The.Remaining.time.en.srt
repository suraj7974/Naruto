1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:12,054
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,743
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,495
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,999
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,420
have also been lost.

9
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,615
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,329
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:37,723
Reunion: The Remaining Time

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,661
What's going to happen?!

18
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,058
What's the deal?!

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,018
Sumaru's mom is being
pressed back!

20
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,483
My star training is
done my own way.

21
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,734
It shouldn't be a match

22
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,239
for one who has completed
proper star training like you.

23
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,908
But what's with that sorry state...?

24
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,704
I can't feel even a smidgeon
of the power from before.

25
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:47,001
Sure enough, you've also got
side-effects from the star training...

26
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,973
Even if this life should end...

27
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,892
I'll never forgive you!

28
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,606
Lord Akahoshi!
What?

29
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:27,041
<=ons>

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,168
You be a good boy!

31
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,586
It's a simple mission.

32
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,004
We'll be able to come back home
right away.

33
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,964
Right! Have a safe journey.

34
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,888
Mother!

35
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,891
Mother!

36
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,810
Mother!

37
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,067
Sumaru...!

38
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,616
Mother!

39
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,910
Sumaru!

40
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,002
Oh, no!

41
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,519
Lord Akahoshi.
Why would you do such a thing?

42
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,770
Is it true then...?

43
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,116
Give it back...

44
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,755
Hold it!

45
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,881
Farewell.

46
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,591
Wh-What?

47
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,223
Then it was Lord Akahoshi

48
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,268
who knocked everyone out
and took Sumaru away?

49
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,354
A sensei who does something
like that

50
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,314
to students who believe in him
is unforgivable!

51
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,650
Why in the world...?
Why would you do such a thing?

52
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,694
It's all for the sake of the village...

53
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,196
It's for the sake of taking back
the star she stole!

54
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,656
Even if that were the case,

55
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,159
that doesn't make for a reason
to cause Sumaru pain!

56
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,163
That person is Sumaru's mom!

57
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,125
M-My...mother...

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,793
Exactly!

59
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,589
However, even if she is your mother,
she's now your enemy!

60
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,093
The person before you is
the woman who stole the star

61
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,013
and attempted to bring about
the doom to our village!

62
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,639
That's wrong!

63
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,517
Sumaru's mom just hid the star

64
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,604
in order to save everyone from
the pain of the training!

65
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,565
Foolishness! Being able to die
for the sake of the village

66
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,525
is a Shinobi's long-cherished dream!

67
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,110
Isn't that right, Sumaru?!

68
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,447
You're going to become the Hoshikage
and put to shame

69
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,616
the Five Great Hidden Villages
that treated us with contempt, right?

70
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,579
Yes... I want to become the Hoshikage
and put them to shame...

71
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:15,292
Show your foolish mother
your determination!

72
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,254
Yes... I can die if it's for
the sake of the village.

73
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,424
Sumaru!
Don't do anything stupid, Sumaru!

74
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,845
His Chakra is in synch with Akahoshi's.

75
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,057
Sumaru is being controlled!
What?!

76
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:37,773
Exactly... I have Sumaru's life
in the palm of my hand.

77
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,192
Lady Natsuhi.

78
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,278
I shall give you the ultimate choice!

79
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,905
Will you take the star?

80
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,200
Or...your son's life?

81
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,121
Wait!

82
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,208
What's the matter, Lady Natsuhi?

83
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,961
Have you realized
your own foolishness?

84
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,632
Lady...

85
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,677
You win, Akahoshi.

86
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,851
Sumaru!

87
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,356
You did it!

88
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,276
Excellent. How did you get it?

89
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,739
Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned it
with good grace.

90
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,242
Lady!

91
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,050
That's dirty!

92
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,221
Sumaru!

93
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:39,895
Sumaru...

94
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,190
Is that person...really...?

95
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,692
What're you doing?!

96
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,111
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

97
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,908
– You...! I won't forgive you!
– You...! I won't forgive you!

98
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:58,205
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
I'm your employer.

99
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,958
– That doesn't make any difference!
– That doesn't make any difference!

100
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,961
Wait, Naruto!
Neji!

101
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,589
Why, Neji? I can't stand this either.

102
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,593
No! From here on is an issue
for the Hidden Star.

103
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,556
It's none of our concern!

104
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,351
That being said, are we just going
to leave them be?

105
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,812
Anything further would be beyond
the scope of the mission...

106
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,191
The Leaf must not betray the client
of the accepted mission, right?

107
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,198
Damn it!

108
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,789
Oh well.

109
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,630
The star has returned.
I'll overlook everyone's actions today.

110
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,759
Those who wish to continue to live
for the sake of the village, come with me...

111
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,221
B-But...Sumaru is...

112
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,936
Forsake the son of the traitor.
Pull out!

113
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,354
Yes, my lord!

114
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,204
I'm sorry. I must not leave
Sumaru behind.

115
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,665
Rogue Ninja!

116
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,294
Hokuto! You'll regret this!

117
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,713
Well, do as you like!

118
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,632
That jerk...!

119
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,259
Hey, look...!

120
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,096
It's called Natsuboshi.

121
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,765
It's the other name for
the planet Mars, right?

122
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,018
It seems it's the same name
as Sumaru's mom...

123
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,980
Sumaru thinks that star
is protecting him.

124
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,943
I bet Lady Natsuhi was also
looking at that star.

125
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,570
I'm moved.

126
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,906
The hearts of parent and child
are connected!

127
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,324
Yeah...

128
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,541
How're the two doing?

129
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,334
They're resting comfortably now...

130
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,128
But Akahoshi attack
the mother took

131
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:57,300
when her body was weakened
from the effects of the star is a fatal one.

132
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,344
Her Chakra Network is in shreds
and it will mean certain death

133
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,806
if she uses that Jutsu
even one more time...

134
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,977
Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could...

135
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,979
Who knows...?

136
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,943
Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk
is unforgivable!

137
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,027
I'll kick his butt!

138
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,321
Naruto...! You still don't get it?

139
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,994
But he's a huge scoundrel.

140
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,287
That's right!

141
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,999
The Leaf would lose credibility

142
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,876
if we do something like betraying a client.

143
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,044
But we can't leave things be, right?

144
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,548
Well, I also understand what
Neji's saying.

145
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,426
We must ask the Lady Hokage
for instructions.

146
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,889
That's right. Anyway, let's take those two
to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

147
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,393
Yeah... The Hidden Star matter
will come after that.

148
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,741
Sumaru.

149
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,659
Mother!

150
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,622
Mother.

151
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,816
You're probably angry,
aren't you, Sumaru...?

152
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,529
Of course, you would resent me...
who abandoned the village

153
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,199
and went so far as to entrust you
to someone else.

154
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,827
How often I attempted to take you
with me...

155
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,331
But I kept telling myself that

156
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:56,127
I couldn't make you happy since
I had become a Rogue Ninja...

157
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,382
with this body that could
give out at any time

158
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,093
due to the star training.

159
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,558
Stay away!

160
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,021
I often had the same dream.

161
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,694
A dream where I chase
after you two, crying.

162
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,125
Sumaru.

163
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,588
Mother!

164
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,466
I kept telling myself

165
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,302
that my mother was not
a cold-hearted person

166
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,595
who would leave me behind...

167
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,847
You had died.

168
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,017
Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.

169
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,645
He said you had been killed by
a Ninja from some other land,

170
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,023
died and turned into a star...

171
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,030
He said you had turned
into the Natsuhiboshi...!

172
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,688
Sumaru...

173
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,651
Mother!

174
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,199
Even so...

175
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,620
Even so...I wanted you to
take me with you.

176
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,497
Sumaru...

177
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,959
I was lonesome... Mother...

178
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:21,147
Natsuboshi, why are you so red?

179
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:26,861
Because I had a sad dream last night

180
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:32,826
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed

181
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,707
Swollen as I cried...

182
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:56,057
Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?

183
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:01,896
I'm searching for a child
who has gone afar

184
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:07,986
He can't be found. though I search all day

185
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,825
My sad dreams come once more

186
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,397
Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!

187
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,985
Where's the lady? Your mom.

188
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,987
Hey, where'd she go?

189
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,197
What?!

190
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,657
This is bad...

191
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,327
Mother!

192
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,181
Even if it costs my life,
I can't let that star be...

193
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,310
There mustn't be any more
sad mothers and children!

194
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,733
Can't let it happen.
If she gets reckless...

195
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,236
and ends up using that Jutsu again...

196
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,916
It became the village's power
and protected the village.

197
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,461
I didn't want to have to destroy it...

198
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,806
But star, you have caused
pain and suffering

199
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,558
to one too many of the children...

200
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,691
Forgive me...

201
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,409
Akahoshi...

202
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,873
Ninja Art: Kujaku

203
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,333
Beast!

204
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,186
Sumaru...

205
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,615
So your strength has given out?
How tragic.

206
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,620
Mother...

207
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,833
Hey, what's the matter?

208
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,795
It couldn't be! Lady Natsuhi is...

209
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,762
Mother died!

210
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,850
As of this moment,

211
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,728
I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name
of Fourth Hoshikage!

212
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,440
I shall announce the first mission
as Hoshikage.

213
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,776
The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,

214
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,614
and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi
are enemies who demean us!

215
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,576
If you find them attempting
to enter the village,

216
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,994
bring them down immediately!

217
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,454
Yes, my lord!

218
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,629
I will...

219
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,007
I will get the one who killed
my mother!

220
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,134
Sumaru!

221
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:16,651
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

222
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,408
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

223
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,798
Yellow Moon.

224
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:45,471
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

225
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:50,727
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

226
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,650
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

227
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:04,532
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

228
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:11,205
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

229
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,087
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

230
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:25,053
A magical chord change, in a restless city

231
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,893
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

232
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,359
Damn that Akahoshi jerk!
I can't forgive him anymore.

233
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,694
He's diabolical.

234
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,820
Hey, you two!

235
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,781
I'll pound him with a good one.

236
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,949
Forget it. Don't stick your nose
into their internal affairs.

237
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,410
Then, I'll beat him into shape
with my Lotus.

238
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,245
That'd be the same as Naruto.

239
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,373
Then what're you saying we do?
Anyway, I'm going, so.

240
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,501
I'll go with you.
No.

241
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,253
Do you guys want to start
a war with the Hidden Star?

242
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:02,048
Next time: "The Star's Radiance."
