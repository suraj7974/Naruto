1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:06,882
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:13,222
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,283
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,831
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,968
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,266
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,895
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,315
even if I'm not by your side

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,529
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

11
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:17,119
into your hands

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:22,708
I can feel it so close,

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:28,506
Our two hearts

14
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,791
–Monju.
–Yes, sir.

15
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,188
Darn, didn't know there was a kid here.

16
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,440
I'll do it.

17
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,358
Okay, it's in your hands, Gantetsu.

18
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,250
Okay. Let's pull out!

19
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,710
Set this place on fire!

20
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,464
Don't leave any evidence.

21
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,329
The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts

22
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,127
Wait up!

23
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,340
Over here! You're it. Try catching me!

24
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,758
Darn...

25
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,593
–Yeah!
–This way! This way!

26
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,804
-I said wait!
-

27
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,310
Lady Tsunade...

28
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,479
With regard to the next request...

29
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,648
What, there's more?

30
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,732
Yes.

31
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,276
Boy oh boy...

32
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,613
This is the last one
so please try to focus.

33
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:40,948
All right.

34
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,662
When the weather continues
to be warm like this...

35
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,248
And what's the request?

36
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,335
About the escort for the convoy with
the fugitive who was secured...

37
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,714
What about it,
that's hardly a difficult mission.

38
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,466
Well, actually there's a bit
of a problem.

39
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,093
Please look at this.

40
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,433
I see. This is somewhat of
a nuisance.

41
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,894
All of the Jonin are out
on S-rank missions,

42
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,232
and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin
have been allocated elsewhere.

43
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,443
Who's left?

44
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,738
Let's see...well...

45
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,161
Multi-Clone Jutsu!

46
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,716
Let's go, Bushy Brows!

47
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,608
Here goes, Naruto!

48
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,362
Leaf Hurricane!

49
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,991
You jerk!

50
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,660
Another serving of
Shadow Clones for you!

51
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,375
You ain't seen nothing yet!

52
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,967
You let your guard down!

53
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,312
Pretty good, Bushy Brow...

54
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,065
The same to you, Naruto...

55
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,984
Naruto! Lee!

56
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,463
Hey, are you guys all right?

57
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,386
Hey, stop moving.

58
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,973
Sakura, can't you be
a little more gentle?

59
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,685
Shut your mouth.
Really, you're being reckless.

60
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,895
That's not true, Sakura.

61
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,564
See, the 100-man
Shadow Clone grapples

62
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,067
are excellent training
for enhancing one's Taijutsu skills.

63
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,113
It's like killing two birds with
one stone for Naruto, too

64
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,990
because this kind of friendly training
lets him polish

65
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,908
his Shadow Clone skills
at the same time.

66
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,577
That's exactly right.

67
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,289
What are you talking about?
All you're doing is slugging it out.

68
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,834
This is what ends up happening
when two guys get together.

69
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,335
That's right.

70
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,258
Anyway, this isn't the time to be
acting carefree like that.

71
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,468
Lady Tsunade is calling for you.

72
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,095
Grandma Tsunade?

73
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,180
What does she want?

74
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,726
Ninja Dropouts?

75
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,770
Yeah.
Ninja Dropouts are

76
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,148
Rogue Ninja who,
of their own free will,

77
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,401
choose not to be Shinobi and leave
their respective villages to join up.

78
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,864
They're a gang of thieves who use brutal
and villainous means to steal.

79
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:13,076
That's horrible...using their abilities
as Ninja for criminal purposes.

80
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,620
That's unforgivable.

81
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,748
One of their members was
captured yesterday

82
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,249
in Ogi Pass
in the Land of Forests.

83
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,043
This guy is the only member

84
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,213
whose wanted notice is
circling around the lands.

85
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,716
He was found wandering about
and taken prisoner.

86
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,135
His name is Gantetsu.

87
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,598
For a former Ninja,
that's pretty lame.

88
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,227
Gantesu is being taken to
the capital city of the Land of Forests

89
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,437
in order to do an exhaustive investigation
into this matter

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,607
for the purpose of wiping out
the Ninja Dropouts...

91
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,443
However, there is a possibility
that the Ninja Dropouts will try

92
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,569
to rescue him along the way...

93
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,114
A police escort has been sent
from the capital

94
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,033
so it is fully prepared for the convoy.

95
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,661
But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,

96
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,287
the idea is that Shinobi would be
the best countermeasure for Shinobi,

97
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,748
so they requested that the Leaf Village
also send out some Ninja.

98
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,459
That's what this request is all about.

99
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,797
I'm getting excited! I'll show 'em
how great Leaf Ninja are!

100
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,841
–Got it!
–Let's give it a shot!

101
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:14,012
All right! Naruto Uzumaki,
Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.

102
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,514
The three of you are assigned
to the mission

103
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,225
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!

104
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,394
–Yes, ma'am!
–Roger!

105
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,567
Look, the harbor.

106
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,954
Huh... So they're gonna
transport him in this.

107
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,040
The only way to get to the capital
of the Land of Forests is

108
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,001
to go up this river.

109
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,961
Hey, look over there.

110
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,176
That's...
The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.

111
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,221
Are you the Leaf Ninja?

112
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,598
Yes. Uh, and who are you?

113
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,475
I'm Tsuzumi with the police department.

114
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,561
I'm supervising this convoy.

115
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,438
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

116
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,526
This guy here's Bushy Brows and
her name is Sakura Haruno.

117
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:15,574
Hmmm... You guys are still kids...
Are you really Ninja?

118
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,658
We sure are.

119
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,702
Huh, we might not look it,

120
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,956
but we're all full-fledged Ninja who've
been tested by fire numerous times.

121
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,168
We'll display our skills for you
at some point.

122
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,794
Just leave it to us.

123
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,840
Well, I have a strong team of
experts handling security,

124
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,508
but if it ever comes to that,

125
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,719
I'm counting on you to use
your specialty, Ninjutsu.

126
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,054
Got it.

127
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,682
Those are the security personnel
guarding the prisoner.

128
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,773
They're all dressed alike, aren't they?

129
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,484
Huh, they don't have much style.

130
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,569
Naruto, that's rude.

131
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,869
Captain Todoroki!

132
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,497
What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?

133
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,458
These people came from the Village Hidden
in the Leaves as reinforcements.

134
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,752
The name's Naruto Uzumaki.

135
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,961
I'm Sakura Haruno.

136
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,463
My name is Rock Lee.

137
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,093
Commander, I told you already.

138
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,387
We already have enough security on this.

139
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,973
Can't be helped.
It's something the bosses decided.

140
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,268
There won't be any role for
you guys to play.

141
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,396
We will guard Gantetsu.

142
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,065
I promise that on this sword.

143
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,152
Huh... That sword's nothing.

144
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,489
Snapping that thing in half would be
as easy as apple pie.

145
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,865
Yeah, with just one finger.

146
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,911
Stop it, you guys!
Please excuse them...

147
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,539
Be careful not to get seasick.

148
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,416
Well, I leave it to you.

149
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
Y-Yes, sir. Thanks.

150
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,842
Gantetsu...

151
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,469
All right...

152
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,346
Put the cage into the belly of the ship!

153
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,350
Okay...Okay...

154
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,855
Okay, lower it!

155
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,215
Wow...

156
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,050
This feels great!

157
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,709
What the heck is this anyway?

158
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,086
They won't let us even get near him.

159
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,339
They're totally treating us like nuisances.

160
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,008
If only those Ninja Dropout guys
would launch an attack,

161
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,928
we could show them how awesome
we are.

162
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,554
Don't say stupid things like that.

163
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,516
The best scenario would be that
the Ninja Dropout won't show up at all.

164
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:32,270
Our mission is to transport Gantetsu
safely to the capital, you know.

165
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,609
But this is getting too boring...
there's no thrill to it.

166
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,860
Better just grin and bear it.

167
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,153
There are missions like this too.

168
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,281
Well, I sure understand
how you feel, Naruto.

169
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,661
Yeah... I guess this is getting
a little boring.

170
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,860
Dig in...

171
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,615
Gimme a break...

172
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,742
Who do those guys think we are?

173
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,619
But this stuff is pretty good.

174
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,246
Yeah, very tasty.

175
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,374
It makes me so mad...

176
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,088
I mean, why did we go to all
the trouble of coming all this way?

177
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,260
I'm gonna do my mission.

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,053
Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.

179
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,514
But the captain's gonna scold you.

180
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,182
I'm doing this out of Ninja pride!

181
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,185
Uh, Naruto!

182
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,478
Naruto!

183
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,792
He does have the face of
a criminal after all.

184
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,384
Todoroki?

185
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,512
What the heck is he doing here?

186
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,060
Akio...!

187
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,906
Damn!

188
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,746
Father! Mother!

189
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,176
Akio...

190
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,140
Akio!

191
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,751
Damn!

192
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,341
Akio...!

193
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,887
I will avenge your death right now!

194
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,527
Oh!

195
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,195
What the heck are you doing?!

196
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,450
Are you in your right mind?

197
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,704
What was it you were about
to do just now?!

198
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,721
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.

199
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh?

200
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,542
What's the matter, Sakura?

201
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,960
Lee, over there.

202
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,885
That's strange...

203
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,387
I've never knew this river has a tributary.

204
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,351
Why are you in here?

205
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,187
Why does that matter?

206
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,273
What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?

207
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,484
What are you talking about?

208
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,861
It looked to me like
you were going to kill him.

209
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,281
Huh? Me?
That's a stupid thing to say.

210
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,953
It's my mission to guard this guy.
Why would I?!

211
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,037
Yeah, I guess.

212
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,580
Even if he is a criminal,

213
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:46,751
you can't just kill him off
without interrogating him first.

214
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,254
A brat talking like he knows, huh?

215
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,714
There isn't any need to interrogate him!

216
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,175
This is the guy who did it!
Huh?

217
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,385
This guy...

218
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:00,765
These guys...slaughtered a lot of people
without mercy...

219
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,102
Even innocent children.

220
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,612
If things continue like this,
we'll be sucked into the tributary...

221
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,905
What should we do?!

222
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,040
Ninja Art: Link and Slay.

223
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,354
What the heck?!

224
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,772
Wh-What is this?

225
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,238
Th-The ship's been sliced in half...

226
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,954
Naruto!

227
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,664
Naruto!

228
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,299
You jerk!

229
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,721
It's them! The Ninja Dropouts!

230
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,972
So they showed up after all...

231
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,895
Gantetsu...

232
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,236
Reinforcements, huh?!

233
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,782
Hey, who are you guys anyway!

234
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,202
The head of the Ninja Dropouts,
Shura, on the scene!

235
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,873
Ninja Dropouts...

236
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,876
We'll take Gantetsu...

237
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,836
I'm not about to let that happen!

238
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,061
The Key to the rusted heart's door

239
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:16,150
Will always be smiling right near by

240
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,411
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

241
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,957
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

242
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,503
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

243
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:40,466
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

244
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,971
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

245
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:49,976
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

246
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:54,230
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

247
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:01,279
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

248
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:05,616
The wind is probably testing our hearts

249
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,621
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

250
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:15,126
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

251
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:20,131
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

252
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,677
The Key to the rusted heart's door

253
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,349
Will always be smiling right near by

254
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,858
Lee, are you all right?

255
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,361
Yes, somehow.
More importantly, what happened?

256
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,446
I don't know.

257
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,781
Only thing I know is that after
that huge crash,

258
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,075
suddenly the ship was sliced in two...

259
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,534
I see.

260
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,287
Well then, we need to confirm everyone's
safety for the moment...

261
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,413
Well...

262
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,748
What's wrong, Sakura?

263
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:59,087
I can't find the prisoner, Gantetsu,
Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.

264
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,923
Next time:
"The Bewildering Forest"
