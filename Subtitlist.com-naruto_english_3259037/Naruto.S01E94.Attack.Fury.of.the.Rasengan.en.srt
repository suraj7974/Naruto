1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,595
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,182
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,769
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,356
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,901
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,404
Right here right now (Burn)

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,450
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,704
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:43,461
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:49,884
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,051
(Yeah!)

12
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:57,308
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,812
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,357
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,531
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

17
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:16,202
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,830
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

19
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,334
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,088
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

21
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,816
My body movements
have finally returned...

22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,026
Blood...

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,200
Lady Tsunade!

24
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:02,289
Say! Say! What's happening?!

25
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,834
Why's Kabuto fighting
with Old Lady Tsunade?!

26
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,337
Take a good look at the headband!

27
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,799
He's Orochimaru's subordinate.

28
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,766
Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!

29
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,237
That man is Orochimaru...

30
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,615
Shizune, you take care of
the guy with the glasses...

31
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,201
I'll take care of Orochimaru.

32
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:48,711
Before that, I'd like to have Tsunade
do something about this body.

33
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,756
The effects of that drug
might still last for awhile...

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,134
There's nothing that
I can do about it.

35
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,886
What? Really?

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,930
Geez. I guess it can't be helped.

37
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,391
I have no choice
but to fight in this condition.

38
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,354
Tsunade... Rest your body
with Recovery Ninjutsu.

39
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,815
Then... What about me, me?

40
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:14,320
You guard Tsunade together
with that pig.

41
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,657
What?! I want to fight, too.
Even I can...

42
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:22,202
No, you won't!
Like that four-eyed kid said, right?

43
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,288
You're on a different level.

44
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,958
The opponent is a Sannin like myself,

45
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,252
and the man who killed
the Third Hokage.

46
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,591
An eye for an eye...
I'm the only one who can fight him.

47
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:41,096
And that four-eyed guy possesses
the same level of power as Kakashi.

48
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,432
Okay.

49
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,142
Then... Shadow Clo...

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,685
Hold it!

51
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,940
Don't use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
It'd be utterly pointless.

52
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,107
What?

53
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,319
It wouldn't even become
much of a diversion...

54
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,571
It'd be a waste of Chakra...

55
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,160
with them as opponents.

56
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,083
Now then, let's get this thing started.

57
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,762
– Summoning Jutsu.
– Summoning Jutsu.

58
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,073
Hi.

59
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,534
– Huh?!
– What is this?!

60
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,202
– Wha...?!
– What the heck's going on?!

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,787
Long time no see.

62
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,664
On account of the drug,

63
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,834
Master Jiraiya still can't build up
Chakra very well.

64
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,756
It looks like your stupid
still hasn't healed, eh, Jiraiya.

65
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:03,012
That's too much even for you
with no ability.

66
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,724
It seems Tsunade got you
with something.

67
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,310
A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,

68
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,272
so perhaps she was thinking ahead
and drugged him

69
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,191
with something that
would contain his power.

70
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,237
To think she'd make
a sacrifice of Jiraiya...

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,199
Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.

72
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,662
To think I'd already have
my handicap spotted.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,626
You are such
a disgraceful guy as always...

74
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,174
Dang it. It kind of ticks me off
when the Pervy Sage is mocked.

75
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,385
Summoning...Jutsu!

76
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,224
The Nine-Tailed Fox kid
from the Chunin Exam.

77
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,353
I wonder if I should've killed him then,
after all.

78
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,857
For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,

79
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,318
I acknowledged his achievement...
and let him slide by.

80
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,197
But the only ones who can break
a Five-Pronged Spell

81
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,159
are the Sannin members
and the Third Hokage.

82
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,746
Which means Jiraiya may have
already taught it to Naruto.

83
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,707
Perhaps.

84
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,544
If he's able to control
the Nine-Tailed Fox's power...

85
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,964
Oh...

86
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,925
Th-This is...

87
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,390
It doesn't quite look to be so.

88
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,355
He isn't endowed with Shinobi ability
to begin with, so...

89
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,565
Why?

90
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,779
He's still got a long way to go,
sure enough.

91
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,782
Why?!

92
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,244
Hello.

93
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,710
Hey, Gamatatsu.
Why did you come out?

94
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,923
Oh, Brother Gamakichi.

95
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,218
It's the first time I've been Summoned.

96
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,512
I-I wonder if I can do my best?

97
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,474
Idiot. Get some snacks
or something and hide.

98
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,479
What? I can get snacks?
Goody-goody.

99
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,231
Here I go.

100
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,069
I'll take Jiraiya.

101
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,030
I leave the rest to you.

102
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,324
It's unfortunate...

103
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,495
Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Sannin.

104
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,146
Naruto!

105
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,816
Your opponent is me.

106
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,739
Earth Style! Dark Swamp!

107
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:23,962
Dang it. I can't completely sink them
with such a puny swamp.

108
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,507
The drug is still working.

109
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,429
But...with this, the snakes can't move.

110
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,066
Ninja Art! Poison Fog!

111
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,779
I'll be up a creek if
I take even one breath.

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,252
My leg tendons...!

113
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,094
I won't be eaten twice...!
No way!

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,153
Here I go.

115
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,787
Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!

116
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,962
Dang it...The Jutsu isn't working well.

117
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,925
Even if we both have handicaps,
you won't one-up me...

118
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,969
Give up now.

119
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,050
It's unfortunate...

120
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,345
Here I had respected you
as a fellow Medical Ninja.

121
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,723
Stop. Stay back!

122
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,476
Please hang on, Lady Tsunade...

123
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:48,690
The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru
is also called, will cry.

124
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,448
My body's heavy.

125
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,996
To think you who were
once called the village madness

126
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,709
would ferry around such a kid
and struggle tirelessly for the village.

127
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,794
You've really fallen, haven't you?

128
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,299
I have a keen eye to discern ability.

129
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:21,723
And that kid...is mediocrity in my eyes.

130
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:28,313
It's precisely for this reason...
that I don't need the Uchiha kid.

131
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:33,693
It's no fun raising a genius
who's good from the start.

132
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,781
So you can't leave him alone

133
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,658
because it's like you're looking
at your old self?

134
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:45,539
That kid can't beat Uchiha who inherited

135
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,624
the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.

136
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:52,254
And that's because Naruto
doesn't possess the Sharingan.

137
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,131
Shinobi ability is about whether

138
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:59,594
one can use and master
all the Jutsu of the world.

139
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:06,101
Ninja refers to one
who can use Ninjutsu.

140
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,607
Shinobi ability is no such thing.

141
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,986
You still don't get it?

142
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,199
A Ninja...is one who endures.

143
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,661
It's a difference of opinion, huh.

144
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,124
I'll teach you one thing.

145
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,378
What's most important for Shinobi ability...

146
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,340
isn't the number of Jutsu
one possesses.

147
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,801
What's important is...

148
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,181
The mettle...

149
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,225
not to give up.

150
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,322
Enough already...you jerk!

151
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,172
The mettle to never give up...

152
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,258
He possesses that.

153
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,490
Heh. I don't know what Jutsu you learned,

154
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,160
but you can't hit me with
such a large motion.

155
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,664
No good.

156
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,916
It won't easily hit with
a moving opponent.

157
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,464
Owwee!

158
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,593
And the Chakra isn't
completely held, yet...

159
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,639
It seems you got a cracked thigh bone
in your left leg

160
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,183
from the battle with the snake.

161
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,895
Well, you can still move if
it's just the bone.

162
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,606
But it's impossible now...

163
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,735
The lateral vastus muscle
in your right leg is totally cut off.

164
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,489
What should I do...?

165
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,075
That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.

166
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,744
If even one arm is taken out, it's over.

167
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,041
Are you scared of me?

168
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,836
Do you want to run away from here?

169
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,759
Naruto, as I recall,

170
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,430
you whooped it up like this
during the first Chunin Exam.

171
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,350
Don't mess with me. I won't run away!

172
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,690
"Don't mess with me. I won't run away."

173
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:02,277
"I'll take it. Even if I'm a Genin for life..."

174
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,531
"I'll become the Hokage at any cost,
so it's okay with me."

175
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,283
"I'm not scared."

176
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,245
Can you...
whoop it up in the same way now?

177
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,498
Unlike you...

178
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,711
I will be the heir to the Hokage name
no matter what!

179
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,675
– Hokage is my dream!
– Hokage is my dream!

180
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:33,642
You're not a kid anymore,
so you should stop whooping it up...

181
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,561
Depending on the situation,

182
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,563
when you want to give up and run away,
you should run away.

183
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,781
Oh my... What's with that look?

184
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,035
You'll die! If you die,
there are no dreams or anything...

185
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,374
Do you want to die?

186
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:02,337
You're still a Genin,
so you should run away on the battlefield.

187
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,757
Don't tell a man to run away.

188
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,368
Kids think that everything is easy.

189
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,831
That's why they talk about foolish dreams
like nothing at all.

190
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,250
That's why they can't give up.

191
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,598
Jiraiya, was it you
who taught him that Rasengan?

192
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:00,520
Are you acting like a teacher by teaching
a Jutsu that can't be learned?

193
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,064
Don't give him false hopes.

194
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:08,820
That's why a moony kid starts joking
that he'll become the Hokage!

195
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,997
They chase after foolish dreams...
and then die.

196
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,543
If I have three days,
I'll master that Jutsu.

197
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,671
Then let's make a bet.

198
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,767
Bastard!

199
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:46,232
As for me... I stand by my words.

200
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,571
That's...my Way of Ninja!

201
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,620
A bet?

202
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,121
I'll give you one week.

203
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,333
If you can master that Jutsu,

204
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,794
I'll acknowledge that
you'll be able to become the Hokage...

205
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,755
and give you this necklace.

206
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,135
You should've just
stayed out of this...

207
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,770
Why?

208
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,946
Why?!

209
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,046
Old Lady Tsunade...

210
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,176
You're still going to get up?

211
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,724
Just like our wager

212
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,603
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.

213
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,733
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

214
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,404
Shadow Clone won't do anything now.

215
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:20,368
Enough... Don't protect me, Naruto.
Stop it!

216
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:26,708
I told you that you'd die
if you were obstinate like that, right?

217
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,003
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing.

218
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,881
Just get out of the way. Run away.

219
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,886
Humph... It's okay.

220
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,146
I...

221
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,239
I absolutely will not die...

222
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,408
until I become the Hokage!

223
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,966
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!

224
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,683
It's the same Chakra movement
as before.

225
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,187
No, this is...different.

226
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,148
I see.

227
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,610
In order to gain a hand
for suppressing Chakra,

228
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,111
the Shadow Clone...

229
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,115
Compress Chakra and...

230
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,409
hold it completely.

231
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,622
Wha...?!

232
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,998
I-It can't be.

233
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,335
Rasengan!

234
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,186
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

235
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,983
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

236
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,529
On your still shoulder

237
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,617
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

238
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:30,456
The city lights are like pieces of stars

239
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,128
That hold us together

240
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,924
"Each one of us

241
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:44,595
glows differently,"

242
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,557
you say laughingly

243
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,730
but you look most dazzling

244
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,151
Like a comet,

245
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:04,282
like the rainbow after the storm

246
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,953
You bring light

247
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,456
into my heart

248
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:16,919
Being lost

249
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:22,675
can be the answer

250
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:28,389
Let's promise

251
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,308
we won't cheat

252
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,979
Uh...like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

253
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,358
I never forget my ideal...

254
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:45,073
to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf
and protect its people.

255
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,785
The Hokages have sacrificed
their lives for that dream.

256
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,497
And now,
I also will put my life on the line.

257
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,418
From this moment,
I am the Fifth Hokage!

258
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,672
Next time: "The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!"
