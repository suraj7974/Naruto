1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:06,590
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:13,514
into your hands

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:32,366
The distance created between us
became too big,

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,956
because we were always together

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:45,087
Your honest reply, "See you..."

6
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:50,634
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,224
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:04,315
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I'm not by your side

9
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,529
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

10
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:17,077
into your hands

11
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:23,042
I can feel it so close,

12
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:28,756
Our two hearts

13
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,977
Please, Sensei!

14
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,498
– What?!
– What?!

15
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,715
Whoa, my heart, my heart!

16
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,178
Huh? There's nothing wrong.

17
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,430
Hey, it's you again.

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,600
To think you'd transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.

19
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,562
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?

20
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:29,066
Shut up! For your sake,
don't be nosing around needlessly.

21
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,540
Yakumo's Sealed Power

22
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,048
Why am I no good?!

23
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,966
Kurenai Sensei?

24
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,470
I want to become a Ninja,
no matter what!

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,513
I must become one!

26
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,933
I told you to give up.

27
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,100
No!

28
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,271
Then I'll just have to perform
a Sealing Jutsu

29
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,732
and seal your power.

30
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,734
Huh?
Huh?!

31
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,653
Kurenai Sensei!

32
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,946
Why?!

33
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:18,425
S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?!

34
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:22,096
As for me,
what am I doing lying here?!

35
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,598
Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei
got stabbed

36
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,976
and my heart leapt out
of my chest and...

37
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,062
No, that's not it.
Where's that girl?

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,480
Where's Yakumo?

39
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,402
It seems you don't remember at all.

40
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,946
You got caught breaking
into a mountain cottage

41
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,656
under special security!

42
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,449
What...?!

43
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,618
The Anbu Black Ops are in action,

44
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,788
so you should be thankful
you're alive!

45
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,332
Oh yeah!

46
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,462
The dream I just had...
It was strangely real.

47
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,799
No doubt it was the girl
in the mountain cottage!

48
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,135
What're you blabbing about?!

49
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,346
I'll inject you with a stimulant
if you don't knock it off.

50
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,266
I can't be doing stuff like this!

51
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,394
Hold it!

52
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,313
The medicine hasn't worn off, yet!

53
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,325
Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!

54
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,662
Kurenai's already gone out.
What?!

55
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,081
You've gone to the trouble
of getting up early.

56
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,376
So how about joining me for
an early-morning marathon?

57
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,795
This isn't the time for that!

58
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,922
Morning marathons are great!

59
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,925
Marathons purge the sweat
and impurities built up

60
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,595
in your body from a night of sleep.

61
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,224
More importantly,
where did Kurenai Sensei go?!

62
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,517
Come to think of it,

63
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,519
she said something about going
to visit someone...

64
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,146
Something about a student

65
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,647
she took care of in the past
being in poor health...

66
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,900
Huh? She went to see Yakumo!

67
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,445
Then at least join me for
some morning exercise!

68
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,616
Morning exercise purges the sweat
and impurities built up

69
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,659
in your body from a night of sleep...

70
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,004
Kurenai Sensei!

71
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,799
Whoa?!

72
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,848
I have something I want to ask you,
Kurenai Sensei.

73
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,936
Naruto, don't stick your nose
into my business any further.

74
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,772
Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!

75
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,649
I don't know if it was
on account of that,

76
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,485
but I just had a strangely real dream!

77
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,362
A dream...?
Yeah.

78
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,782
You said to Yakumo that you were
going to use a Sealing Jutsu

79
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,700
if she wouldn't give up
becoming a Ninja...

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,746
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry...

81
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,290
H-Hey. Wait!

82
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,251
It doesn't concern you...

83
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,797
Yes, it does!

84
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,591
Hinata, Kiba and Shino are
all troubled

85
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,219
because you said you were
going to quit!

86
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,849
Doesn't the fact that
you're quitting Squad Eight

87
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,018
have something to do with
that girl Yakumo?!

88
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,526
What you saw wasn't just a dream...

89
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,694
What...?!

90
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:31,785
I used a Sealing Jutsu and
took away a student's power!

91
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,205
No way. That couldn't be!

92
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,293
It happened over a year ago...

93
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,463
By my own hand,
I crushed the dream of a girl...

94
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,426
I tutored individually named Yakumo...

95
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,221
who was trying to become
a practitioner of Genjutsu.

96
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,514
No way!

97
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,393
I don't deserve to have
the lives of the Genin

98
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,812
in Squad Eight entrusted to me.

99
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,107
But why...?

100
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,028
Now, get out of my way!

101
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,946
That's the end of this conversation.

102
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,283
No way...
But I still have stuff I want to ask you...!

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,951
I have no choice.

104
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,837
What's happening?!

105
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,683
They won't come off!

106
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,064
Kurenai Sensei, that's just cruel!

107
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,949
We're already surrounded...

108
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,409
Make emergency contact
with the village...

109
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,827
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,375
There!

111
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,435
What?!

112
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,490
We're counting on you!

113
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,202
What?!

114
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,254
Hurry...to the Hokage!

115
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,092
Yakumo... Come with us.

116
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,539
Geez, that Naruto.

117
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,460
The least he could do is thank me
for attending to him all night.

118
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,507
What?!

119
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,062
Isn't it about tea time?

120
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,606
After you've taken care of
these documents!

121
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,194
Why's there so much work?

122
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,364
It's because you didn't take care
of it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade.

123
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,159
It's a carrier pigeon for
emergency contacts!

124
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,244
What?!

125
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,000
It's from the mountain cottage
in Satomi Hill...

126
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,461
Something's happened to Yakumo!

127
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,355
There's a possibility that
a person being protected

128
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,567
by the Village Hidden in Leaves,
Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.

129
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,821
Head for the mountain cottage in
Satomi Hill and secure Yakumo.

130
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,825
Yakumo Kurama...

131
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,246
As I recall, that's the girl Kurenai
took custody of, right?

132
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,376
Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo
of the Kurama Clan head family.

133
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,422
Umm, what's the Kurama Clan?

134
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,049
It's natural that you guys wouldn't know.

135
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,552
They were a distinguished family

136
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,596
that wielded considerable power
in the village,

137
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,890
but they're just a shadow
of what they used to be.

138
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:49,686
The death of Murakumo
and his wife about a year ago

139
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,605
became the catalyst for that.

140
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,608
I hear that the clan fell apart
after that.

141
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,153
Does the kidnapping of the only
daughter of the head family mean

142
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:02,240
that the Kurama Clan's
Hidden Jutsu is being targeted?

143
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,076
Well...

144
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,953
According to the documents

145
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,538
handed down from
the Third Hokage,

146
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,958
it seems her latent powers as
a Genjutsu Ninja

147
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,919
are extremely dangerous...

148
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,341
In other words, she would make
for a powerful asset

149
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,426
if those powers can be awakened.

150
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,429
That means it wouldn't
be surprising

151
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,223
if there were guys seeking
that power, huh?

152
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,391
After her parents died,

153
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,853
she was kept under
protective custody in the village.

154
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,523
All right. Leave it to me!

155
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,983
I won't allow a girl to cry!

156
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,653
Might Guy,
the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil

157
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,239
will rescue her,
no matter what!

158
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,241
Sakura, you go with them as well.

159
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,408
– What?!
– Huh?

160
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,160
Once we have her in custody,

161
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,954
we'll need someone to look
after her condition.

162
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,999
Only one with experience as
a Medical Ninja can do this.

163
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,626
Y-Yes ma'am!

164
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,339
This mission is a chance
to show my master

165
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,883
the fruits of my training!

166
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,351
Ouch!

167
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,813
Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root
or something?

168
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,692
What's this?!

169
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,156
N-Naruto...!

170
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,411
He fell asleep in a place like this?!

171
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,211
Nice, Akamaru!

172
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,798
Naruto...

173
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,933
He's...caught in a Genjutsu!
– Huh?
– Huh?

174
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,940
Dispel!

175
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,079
What...? Sakura...

176
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,208
Ohh... Salty!

177
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:22,797
What the hell is this?!
I mean, was I asleep again?

178
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,716
What're you babbling about?!

179
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,802
You were caught in a Genjutsu.

180
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,012
Genjutsu...

181
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,768
I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei

182
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,811
who was heading for
the Satomi mountain cottage

183
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,813
and I tried to get her to listen to me.

184
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,024
Satomi mountain cottage,
you say?

185
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,027
Then Kurenai went alone?

186
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,570
Yeah, probably.

187
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,532
Kurenai's in danger

188
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,160
if she went without being aware
what's happening!

189
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,244
Huh?

190
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,922
Something's strange...

191
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,346
Someone's here!

192
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,308
Damn it. Was it a mistake
to come alone...?

193
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,560
But I don't have the time
to return to the village...

194
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,106
They're most likely after...Yakumo.

195
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,360
What?!

196
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh no!

197
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:56,558
Sorry, but I mustn't allow you
to interfere with our work.

198
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,730
Wha...?!

199
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,858
You think you caught me with that?

200
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,942
What?!

201
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,112
You're the one who's caught!

202
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,447
The enemies are also practitioners
of Genjutsu.

203
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,824
I must not lose...

204
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,290
What's this presence?!

205
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,530
They're both caught in a Genjutsu.

206
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,876
Yakumo... Is that you, Yakumo?

207
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,024
You're okay!

208
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,780
Help me...!

209
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,077
It's okay now, Yakumo.

210
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,373
I'll protect you, no matter what.

211
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,167
Kurenai Sensei!

212
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,436
Dispel!

213
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,111
You were hit with
a reverse Genjutsu, eh?

214
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,363
I-I'm sorry.

215
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,407
Just what I'd expect from
a Jonin...

216
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,745
No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi...

217
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,706
Stay alert!

218
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,499
We should consider ourselves

219
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,668
as being under suspicion
by the Leaf Village.

220
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,128
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

221
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,676
The two who took Yakumo
haven't returned...

222
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,889
I guess somewhat violent action
can't be avoided.

223
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,934
Although we come from
the same village...

224
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,312
we will get Yakumo,
no matter what the cost.

225
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,396
Understood?

226
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,481
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

227
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,859
Oh!

228
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,194
What is it, Hinata?!

229
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,820
Did you see something?

230
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,993
The mountain cottage is
being attacked by someone.

231
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,163
There are four out front and four inside
the mountain cottage.

232
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,457
Are two of the people inside
the mountain cottage

233
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,792
Kurenai and Yakumo?

234
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,585
I bet that's it!

235
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,756
Kurenai Sensei,
what the hell happened?!

236
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,969
Tell us!

237
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:10,144
The Key to the rusted heart's door

238
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:16,234
Will always be smiling right near by

239
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:26,536
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

240
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

241
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,712
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

242
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,341
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

243
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:45,513
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

244
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,809
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

245
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:54,397
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

246
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,487
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

247
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,908
The wind is probably testing our hearts

248
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:10,705
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

249
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,334
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

250
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:19,964
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

251
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,719
The Key to the rusted heart's door

252
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:30,767
Will always be smiling right near by

253
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,775
I'm surprised...

254
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,318
Who would've thought that

255
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,111
the intruders would turn out
to be you people.

256
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,074
But whatever reasons you may have,
I won't let you take Yakumo!

257
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,993
The Third Hokage entrusted
this child to me.

258
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,081
Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,

259
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:57,627
I will protect this child with
every ounce of strength I have in my body.

260
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,547
Next time: "Kurenai's Top-Secret Mission:
The Promise with the Third Hokage"
