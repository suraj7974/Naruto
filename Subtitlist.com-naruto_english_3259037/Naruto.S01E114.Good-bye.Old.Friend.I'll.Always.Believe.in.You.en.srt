1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:19,979
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,317
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,467
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,928
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,099
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:00,686
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:11,197
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,784
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,412
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,881
and melting away

17
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,179
Shikamaru always believed in me...

18
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:41,018
More than myself or Neji or
any of us here... He is stronger!

19
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,566
Let's go, fatso!

20
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,028
Don't YOU say that!

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,781
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

22
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,076
Arm!

23
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,041
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

24
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,711
Leg!

25
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,631
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

26
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,174
Arm!

27
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,233
Don't mess with me! Scum!

28
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,988
Eat this!
What!

29
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,949
Super Expansion Jutsu!

30
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,382
Good-bye Old Friend!
I'll Always Believe in You!

31
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,973
I did it...Shikamaru...

32
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,478
What?!

33
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,152
I can't believe I had to get to
the second state

34
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,946
for an opponent like this one...

35
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,036
Slamming Palm

36
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,350
What...What is that appearance?!

37
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,436
Now that it's come to this, it's over.

38
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,607
In the second state, I can put out
ten times more power than I have thus far.

39
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,317
I'm invincible.

40
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,828
It's too painful to move...

41
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,207
Who knew that the side effects
of the Curry Pill would be this intense.

42
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:14,755
This is what happens...

43
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,676
to a powerless scum for butting in!

44
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,601
Playing Ninja better suits you!

45
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,651
Raise your hand if you're playing Ninja.

46
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,988
Wait...

47
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,949
Rock, paper...scissors!

48
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,409
Split!

49
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,162
One, two, three...

50
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,124
W-Wait!

51
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,964
99...100!

52
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,014
Hey! I said, split!

53
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,933
Ouch!

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,185
Found you!

55
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,146
Give up quietly, the two of you!

56
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,864
We finally caught 'em!

57
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:26,285
I'm sick of this!
The team with Choji always loses!

58
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,996
Sorry...

59
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,810
I need a lot of Chakra
for this "second state."

60
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,230
I'll take whatever Chakra you have left!

61
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,693
Well then, I'll take them now.

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,951
There's not much left...

63
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,828
You're empty!

64
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,582
I haven't had nearly enough to eat...

65
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,017
I said I haven't had enough to eat!

66
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,978
Huh...?

67
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,731
What, just one last piece, huh...

68
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,194
When I said I haven't had enough to eat...

69
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:51,370
Just as I thought, you're the scum
used as a sacrificial pawn.

70
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:57,209
Die...you pitiful fatso, the odd man out.

71
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,712
I won't let you play Ninja with us!

72
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,298
Why?

73
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,176
Because if we let you play, we'll lose.

74
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,761
You're slow.

75
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,476
Yeah, but...then the number
of people won't be even.

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,855
Japanese chess is fun
because the number of pieces are even.

77
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:24,069
A piece that is useless is
the same as not having that piece!

78
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,279
Yeah, that's right!

79
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,160
We're the ones with fewer people
and we're not complaining.

80
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,661
Hurry up, let's do it!

81
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,247
if it's okay with you, then it's fine...

82
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,040
Okay, it's settled!

83
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,792
We can win it!

84
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,712
Yes!
Where are we gonna hide this time?

85
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:22,961
And um, the whole Akimichi Clan
is fat and slow...

86
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,588
That's what everyone says.

87
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,715
Really...

88
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,807
But Choji, you're a kindhearted guy...
more than everyone else.

89
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,190
One day, you'll surely make friends
who'll see that quality of yours.

90
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,987
And then you should cherish those friends

91
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,490
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other...

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:59,164
Can I really make...friends like that...
someone like me...?

93
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,291
Rest in peace...

94
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,627
you're not the only one I'm going to get.

95
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,672
After I kill you,

96
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:13,303
I'm going to get the cruel, sleazy,
mean guys who used you as a sacrifice!

97
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,730
Because he...promised...

98
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,696
You better catch up with us...Choji.

99
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,197
Okay!

100
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:38,954
He's definitely going to defeat
the opponent and come after us...!

101
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:44,584
Yep!
That's right...he can do it.

102
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,089
Okay! While I'm here...

103
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,092
Me too...

104
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,431
All right, everyone,

105
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,392
we get Sasuke back
before Choji catches up!

106
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,520
Wait!

107
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,981
All right! Here we come!

108
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,872
He's late...that Jirobo...

109
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,167
He's greedy and eats so much...

110
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,836
He's probably squeezing out Chakra
even from the marrow of their bones.

111
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,048
I wish he had switched with me already...

112
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
Here, I'll give it back!

113
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,102
Well, then...

114
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,022
If I linger, I won't be able to catch up.

115
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,524
It's about time to put an end to this.

116
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,740
The Chili Pepper Pill is left...

117
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:02,954
But...if I take that...
I'll die, without a doubt...

118
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,171
Don't you dare die, Choji...

119
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,554
We've been doing things together
since that day...

120
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,952
Oh...! You...

121
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,914
You...were there just now...

122
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,375
What about playing Ninja?

123
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,627
It was a drag,
so I pulled myself out from it.

124
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,714
Huh...?
By the way, that's my special seat.

125
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,508
Your special seat?

126
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:02,347
I like to lie on my back and
look at the clouds on a nice day like this.

127
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,684
You've come to look at clouds?

128
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,229
Mind if I sit there?

129
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,398
Oh...sure!

130
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,655
This is a good place.
You can see the clouds well.

131
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,701
Yeah...

132
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,331
Why don't you...
What...?

133
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,296
watch the clouds with me
and lounge around?

134
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,257
Okay!

135
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,511
You know! I-I brought snacks. Want some?

136
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,888
Oh, that'd be great!

137
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,017
Thanks.

138
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,233
Eating potato chips
while watching clouds...this is the best.

139
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,568
Yep!

140
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,825
My name is Shikamaru... from the Nara Clan.

141
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,952
You... What's your name?

142
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:10,624
It's Choji! Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan!

143
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,128
Choji, huh...
I think I'll get along with you.

144
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,589
Me, too!

145
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,853
We'll always do things together
from now on, too.

146
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,440
Choji...!

147
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,371
Shikamaru... Sorry...I can't go...

148
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,832
It's over...

149
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,294
But, this guy...

150
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,257
I have to beat him...
even if it means death.

151
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,968
No matter what you do now, it's too late!

152
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,427
Crushing Palm!

153
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,664
Wh-What's that...?

154
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,250
But...

155
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,711
Boulder Blow!

156
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,673
It's no good!

157
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,636
I'm 100 times stronger than before!

158
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,186
They say that food can be a reason

159
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,647
for people to hold a horrible grudge
against somebody.

160
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:03,486
The blow just now...
was for eating the last bite of my snack...

161
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,113
No way!

162
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,450
This guy has so much Chakra that
his body has changed physically!

163
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,577
And this is...

164
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,125
for making fun of me by calling me
a sacrificial pawn and fat!

165
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,338
But what I can't forgive you for
more than anything else ...

166
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:27,761
You sure do suffer when
you have a stupid leader. You underlings!

167
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,138
Well... I'll kill you losers

168
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:35,685
before you suffer working
under a glum shadow lover like him!

169
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,690
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!

170
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,779
You insulted my best friend!

171
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:52,369
More than mocking me by calling me fat,

172
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,996
and poaching the last bite
of a four-star meal...

173
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,708
I can't forgive you for that!

174
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,631
All of my Chakra...to my left hand!

175
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,132
Uh, uh-oh...!

176
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,345
This blow...is heavier than my life!

177
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,556
W-Wait...! Don't be hasty...!

178
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,893
I...I won.

179
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,647
Me... I won!

180
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,590
Everyone...

181
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,219
But Choji...

182
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,139
you're a kindhearted guy,
more than everyone else...

183
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,855
One day, you'll surely make friends
who'll see that part of you...

184
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,820
And then you should cherish those friends

185
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,280
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other.

186
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,425
"Hurry up and get over here." It's Naruto.

187
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,012
"Everyone's waiting." Kiba...

188
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,391
Shikamaru...

189
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,199
Ino-Shika-Cho!

190
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,257
Even if it is just potato chips,

191
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,010
I won't let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.

192
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,057
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,

193
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,435
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

194
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,569
Dad...

195
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,282
I've made...a lot of friends...

196
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,528
What happened?

197
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,869
Nothin'...

198
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,775
Once in a long while,

199
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,404
once in a while

200
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:25,201
The remnants of a person broken by dreams

201
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,831
Look like a mountain

202
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,005
Clinging to the Divine,

203
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,758
clinging to Buddha

204
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:46,597
The remnants of a person crying

205
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,810
Look like a mountain

206
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,939
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

207
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

208
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,739
Shake shake shake Let's look

209
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

210
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:19,464
Look like a mountain

211
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,054
Look like a mountain

212
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,557
Look like a mountain

213
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,561
Look like a mountain

214
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,525
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

215
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,861
Take this!
Fang Over Fang!

216
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,988
Byakugan!

217
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,116
That damn spider bastard!

218
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,410
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji.
Our careful planning is not working!

219
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,872
If we dawdle Sasuke will be gone!

220
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,499
Hey, what should we do?!

221
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,668
If we want to continue our pursuit,
there's only one way to do it!

222
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,297
Next time: "Your Opponent is Me!"
