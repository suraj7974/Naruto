1
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,504
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,551
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,847
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,686
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,117
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,968
Mess up the village...you say?!

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,805
I won't let you do that
no matter what!

17
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,642
I mean, there's no way
just the four of you can do that!

18
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,852
But, we can...

19
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,606
A person who knows village matters
very well gave us information

20
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,024
on where and how to attack.

21
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,401
Knows village matters very well...

22
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:51,987
It couldn't be!

23
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,739
You mean Orochimaru?!

24
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,033
Who knows...?

25
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:02,373
Well, that's how it is,
so we can't have you guys living.

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,250
Umm, can you see this?

27
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,837
Paper Bombs!

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,089
We're going to detonate
the Paper Bombs

29
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,382
after we've left here...

30
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,050
There's nowhere to run...

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,594
There's no chance of someone
coming to save you.

32
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,887
Prepare yourselves.

33
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,682
It's better than going back
to the Academy, isn't it?

34
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,560
Umm, rest in peace.

35
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,104
H-Hey! Just a minute!

36
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,568
Farewell, real me.

37
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:36,574
Run, Dodge, Zigzag!
Chase or be Chased!

38
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,706
It should've just been
hunting for treasure,

39
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,583
but to think this would happen...

40
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,585
Sure enough,
nothing good comes

41
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,128
of being together with you
on missions, Naruto!

42
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,297
This isn't the time to be
saying stuff like that!

43
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:56,385
They're attempting to mess up
the Leaf Village by impersonating us!

44
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,680
Then how're we going
to get out of here?!

45
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,806
Well...

46
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,559
If I use the Rasengan,
I could somehow...

47
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,770
They'd notice that!

48
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,814
It'd be the end if we were
to get ambushed outside.

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,610
Then, with your Fang Over Fang...

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,612
That'd be the same, the same!

51
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,696
You moron!

52
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,616
Then what should we do?!

53
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,700
– Umm...
– Huh?

54
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,786
If I use
my Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms...

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,246
I get it!

56
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,791
With that we can weather this crisis
without the guys outside noticing!

57
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,711
If I could just loosen
these ropes a little...

58
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,881
Leave that to me!

59
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,888
N-Naruto?!

60
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,598
All right!

61
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,807
Me, too!

62
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,311
Kiba...

63
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,523
Akamaru...

64
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,988
Just a little more...

65
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,122
It snapped...

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,387
Protective 8 Trigrams...

67
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,185
64 Palms!

68
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,075
Now then,
shall we go as arranged?

69
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,077
– Kiba!
– Yeah!

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,286
– Hinata!
– Yes!

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,788
Naruto!

72
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,081
I know!

73
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,348
Hinata!

74
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,809
You okay?

75
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
Oh...!

76
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,190
What...?

77
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:21,572
Hey, Hinata!
Cut our ropes before you faint.

78
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,618
Right.

79
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,875
It seems the guys outside
are gone.

80
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,129
It doesn't look like this place
is going to hold up now.

81
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,007
It looks like it'd be best for us
to escape as soon as we can.

82
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,637
What's that?!

83
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,181
It's the buried treasure chest.

84
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,474
Leave it be!

85
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,808
It's a fake anyway.

86
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,186
And there might be
some kind of trap set.

87
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,522
But it's our mission to
take this back with us, so...

88
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,984
There really might be
buried treasure in it, right?!

89
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,527
Byakugan!

90
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,158
It looks empty inside...
Wait, there's paper inside.

91
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,452
Isn't it a Paper Bomb?

92
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,331
It doesn't seem to be
anything dangerous...

93
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
Then I guess I'll take it for now.

94
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,544
Come on, there's no need
to go to the trouble of...

95
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,007
But it might make for a good mark
to distinguish him from the imposter...

96
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,383
I get it.

97
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,889
Akamaru, you're the mark for
the real me, so stay close to me.

98
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:34,937
There's no time.

99
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,066
I'll be going with our Fang Over Fang.
Make sure you keep up!

100
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,734
R-Right.

101
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,197
Man-Beast Clone...

102
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:47,825
Fang Over Fang!

103
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,793
You okay, Hinata?

104
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:03,799
I'm fine... I just have to follow
after Kiba, so...I'll be o...

105
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,010
Hinata!

106
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,641
All right!

107
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,238
You okay, Hinata?

108
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,198
Naruto!

109
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,787
Does your leg hurt?

110
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,372
Kiba...

111
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,001
If your leg hurts, say so first.

112
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,629
I was thinking
I must not cause trouble, so...

113
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,132
Actually, that is trouble.

114
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,676
I'm sorry...

115
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,974
Surprisingly, this might be
the weakness of our team.

116
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,267
Huh...?

117
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,146
Hinata shows too much
concern for us.

118
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,566
Naruto and I speak too bluntly to
each other and we get into fights...

119
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,818
N-Now that you mention it...

120
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,822
If we'd take on our missions while
being a little conscious of stuff like that,

121
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:12,034
we might...
become a pretty good team.

122
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,579
Got it!

123
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,164
I'll try...

124
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,793
All right. Then Naruto and I will go
after those guys.

125
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,590
Hinata, you come later.
Your leg's hurt, so don't force things...

126
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,300
Got it.

127
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,930
Listen up. You're hurt, Hinata.
So you follow later.

128
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,557
I just said that, didn't I?

129
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,142
Huh? Did you?

130
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,937
Right...Thanks...

131
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,731
Let's go, Naruto!

132
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,028
I have to hurry, too...

133
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm back!

134
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,827
You're back, Naruto?

135
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,588
We couldn't catch up
with them, huh...?

136
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,966
Naruto? Kiba?!

137
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,510
Was I here just now?!

138
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,928
Y-Yeah.

139
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,222
That one was an imposter!

140
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,515
Say what?!

141
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,308
But the dog didn't notice anything...

142
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,520
He can't be sniffed out even
with the nose of a Ninja Hound!

143
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,397
Akamaru was fooled, too!

144
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,650
We've got trouble!
To the Hokage, immediately.

145
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,734
Right!

146
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,946
Akamaru! You remember the smell
of that Agari old man, right?!

147
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,198
After him!

148
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,828
Lady Tsunade!

149
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,414
We've just received
a communication...!

150
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,417
Nobody realizes it.

151
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,046
Stay sharp.
Our mission isn't over yet, so.

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,382
That's right.
The crucial part comes now.

153
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,427
Someone's coming!

154
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,061
We found you, imposters!

155
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,649
We'll kick your butts!

156
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,404
Oh-ho... So you're alive...

157
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,239
Naturally!

158
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,908
This time it's your turn
to prepare yourselves...

159
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,078
After all, this is our home field.

160
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,750
There are times when you lose

161
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,711
even when fighting
on your home field!

162
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,921
We won't let you get away!

163
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,343
H-Hinata?!

164
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,346
I'm going to inform the Hokage!

165
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,931
Naruto, you go after the imposters!

166
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,850
Got ...it.

167
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,686
Hey...

168
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:50,859
Upon careful thought,
the real Hinata hasn't come yet...!

169
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,652
You imposter!

170
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,616
What the...?!

171
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,622
What're you doing to Hinata?!

172
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,751
It's just like I'm the imposter.

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,461
Naruto!

174
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,380
What're you doing?!

175
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,382
W-Well...

176
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,717
He's an imposter!

177
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,260
What?!

178
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,391
Prepare yourself, imposter!

179
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,017
Hey! Wait a minute...!

180
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,187
Hey, you're also an imposter!

181
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,441
Even if you can copy
the appearance and scent,

182
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,610
you can't go so far as
copy Ninjutsu, right?!

183
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,529
Let's go, Akamaru.

184
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,323
Fang Over...?

185
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,956
Knocked out...?

186
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,502
No way. It was just a punch,
and I didn't even use a Jutsu...

187
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,753
Come to think of it...

188
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:55,882
I was slugged good and hard,
but I didn't feel it at all.

189
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,428
Hey! Weren't you going
to mess up the village?!

190
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,055
You guys are utterly weak!

191
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,516
Damn it!

192
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,228
I'll catch the fake Hinata,
so you handle yourself somehow!

193
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,563
Leave me to me!

194
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,856
Hold it!

195
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,818
Hold it!

196
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,614
I wonder if I got overly ambitious
and borrowed too many books...

197
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,709
Hey, Naruto!

198
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,503
You...

199
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,176
You moron!

200
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,345
You're butt is so heavy
you fell right on it!

201
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,223
Ugly! Ugly!

202
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,852
Forehead girl!

203
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,317
I'll kick your butt
the next time I see you!

204
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,862
I'll kick your butt,
no matter what!

205
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,697
Sakura, get out of the way!

206
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,409
Naruto.

207
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,078
I'll kick your butt!

208
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,832
Wh-Why?!

209
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,672
What?

210
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,385
Why's the Naruto who ran that way
coming from over here?

211
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,848
I'm off on a delivery.

212
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,391
Right. Take care.

213
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,981
What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!

214
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,818
Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in...

215
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,570
What...?

216
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,575
Na-ru-to!

217
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,162
How dare you do that
to my daughter...?!

218
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,665
Wh-What...?

219
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,417
I'm okay, Dad.

220
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,836
No, you rest a bit.

221
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,048
I will have Naruto take the responsibility
and make the delivery!

222
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,675
What?!

223
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,511
But, but I...

224
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,179
If you refuse,

225
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,266
I'll never let you eat
my ramen ever again!

226
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,814
This isn't the time for me
to be making a delivery!

227
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,482
I finished the delivery!

228
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,650
Okay! Good work!

229
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,360
Where did he go?!

230
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,362
My...imposter!

231
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,994
This jerk was also weak...

232
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,833
Kiba... Stop...
Forgive me...

233
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:41,214
That might've worked on Naruto.
But I hate soppy stuff...

234
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,841
like that!

235
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,223
Did these guys seriously
intend to attack the village...?

236
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,435
Where are you, imposter?!

237
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,853
Come out!

238
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,646
Hey!

239
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,731
Hey!

240
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,612
Could it be that I came here?

241
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,488
Yeah, you did.

242
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,117
You'll be paying me for
what you ate earlier.

243
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,994
That jerk...!

244
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,675
Forty-five plates...

245
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,852
Here.

246
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,159
Eating and running with
someone else's face...

247
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,827
That imposter...

248
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:59,334
He's not messing up the village,
he's messing up my reputation.

249
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,252
Hey...

250
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,837
No way...!

251
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,516
My Golden Delicious Ninja Way
Ramen Pure Heart of Fire

252
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,643
I'd been setting aside!

253
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,440
I won't allow it...!

254
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,151
No matter what, I won't allow it...!

255
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,946
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

256
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,158
– Go!
– Go!

257
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,036
– Where is he?!
– Where's the imposter?!

258
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,831
– Where are you?!
– Imposter!

259
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,791
Where are you?! Come out!

260
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,377
I'll kill you, imposter!

261
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,839
I'll pay the bill later!

262
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,508
– Find him!
– Where is he?!

263
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,385
There he is!

264
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,432
Hey!

265
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,771
– I won't let you get away!
– Got you!

266
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,023
– I've got you!
– You're wrong!

267
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,567
– Is it you?!
– I'm not an imposter!

268
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,277
Calm down, guys!

269
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,489
The imposter isn't carrying
a chest on his back!

270
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,826
– What?
– It's not him?

271
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,746
– Now that you mention it...
– That's right.

272
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,830
That's right!

273
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,331
Then...

274
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,211
It's him!

275
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,672
Yikes!

276
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,846
At the end of the day,
these guys were nothing special.

277
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,933
Hey, are these guys really
Orochimaru's henchmen?

278
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,268
Who knows?

279
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,021
The Hokage will look
into the details for us.

280
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,857
That's right.
Man, I'm tired.

281
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,860
My shoulders got stiff from carrying
this thing around the whole time.

282
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,532
Naruto! Kiba!

283
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,160
Oh, the real Hinata's come back.

284
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,997
Hey, Hinata! Over here!

285
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,749
Naruto!

286
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,087
He's not carrying the chest on his back...
Then this Naruto...

287
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,635
He's the imposter!

288
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,388
Gentle Fist!

289
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,852
Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto...

290
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,524
– What?!
– What?!

291
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,317
A test?!

292
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,903
This mission was a test

293
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,782
in order to see the teamwork
of you three.

294
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:40,245
A Shinobi will often have to
form teams with various others

295
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,956
in response to the qualities
and conditions of the mission.

296
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,958
At such times,

297
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,920
failing if teamed with
a certain other person is a problem.

298
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,424
And so I gave you a mission
that was easy at the start.

299
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,760
And I made it so along
the way...

300
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,804
something would happen
involving a village crisis.

301
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,014
At that time,

302
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,684
I wanted to see whether
you could handle it as a team.

303
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,185
So that's what it was...

304
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,770
That's harsh!

305
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,731
We would've died if
we'd made the slightest mistake.

306
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,655
It's okay. I got the story about
you guys from Lady Tsunade.

307
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,533
It was set up so even if
you were to make a mistake,

308
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,909
you would only be injured.

309
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,662
Since this time around
you had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru,

310
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,873
I enlisted the help
of the Kedouin Clan...

311
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,835
so you wouldn't be able
to distinguish the enemy.

312
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,671
And?

313
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,840
How did these three do?

314
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,259
Let me see...

315
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,806
They floundered part of the way
and I was worried about the outcome...

316
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,604
But I shall pass them.

317
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,774
In terms of results,
they did capture us, so...

318
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,861
Oh yeah.

319
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,113
That's...!

320
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,325
It was more or less
our mission to bring this, so.

321
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,994
With this, our mission is complete.

322
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,246
There's no point in going
to the trouble of bringing...

323
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,748
No, no.

324
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:12,337
There is something important inside
that I must give to you, Lady Hokage.

325
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,175
Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.

326
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,635
You, too.

327
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,886
See ya.

328
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,970
Yeah.

329
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,769
Are they going to look
like that forever?

330
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,773
It seems they'll get their own faces back
naturally in a few days.

331
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,857
I see...

332
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,276
Wh-What's this...?!

333
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,947
A bill for the recent training...?!

334
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,201
Here...he said he'd be glad
to cooperate...

335
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,495
It comes to this much?

336
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,414
This is a hard world to live in,
isn't it?

337
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,793
My name is Tsunade...

338
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,879
My concern now is a debt
that absolutely will not go down.

339
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,799
More like, it's growing, isn't it?

340
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:03,596
I shouldn't have become...
the likes of Hokage...!

341
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,738
The wind blows, Ah...

342
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,575
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

343
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,995
What should be brought along?

344
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,998
Assemble them into a piece.

345
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,085
There is no second chance, never

346
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,754
How foolish it is to throw away

347
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,966
Acting so innocently, Ah...

348
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,926
The images.

349
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,975
It probably will not end

350
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,273
It probably will not end

351
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,986
Burn that love-filled heart,

352
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,197
Sail across a thousand dreams

353
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,117
Running freely

354
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

355
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,874
The clouds scatter

356
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,044
The sun sets yet again

357
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:22,550
The solo parade begins to move.

358
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,803
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

359
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:29,265
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

360
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,069
No, it's gone, gone, gone!
Where'd you put it, Naruto?

361
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,570
Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it.

362
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,654
You wrote it?

363
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:44,739
And I gave it to
a Delivery Ninja.

364
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,032
You gave it?

365
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,992
So it should reach
the other party today.

366
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,829
You idiot!
At this rate, my life as a writer will...

367
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,873
More importantly,
let's get the training started.

368
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,417
Shut up and come with me, Naruto!

369
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,711
We have to get that back at any cost!

370
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,048
Next time: "Please, Mr. Postman!"
