1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,396
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,817
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,821
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,706
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:44,837
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:49,383
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,511
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,644
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,193
In time,

13
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:11,322
we'll realize
that it was everything

14
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,742
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

16
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,251
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

17
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:28,005
and melting away

18
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,979
Not yet? Idate hasn't come, yet?

19
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,861
My lord, we finally found evidence

20
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,072
regarding the matter
we were investigating.

21
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,032
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,954
Mm, good work.

23
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,415
My lord, is there something amiss?

24
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,709
No, it's nothing.

25
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,549
Concentrate on my Chakra.

26
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,083
We're saved.

27
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,171
Sasuke, are you okay?

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,139
Naruto, I'm counting on you.

29
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,391
Protect Idate.

30
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,355
The Last Leg:
A Final Act of Desperation

31
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,486
Poison needles won't work on me.

32
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,199
How dare you do that
to Sasuke and Sakura?!

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,243
Rest easy.

34
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,622
I'll send you to the place
where they are real soon.

35
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,958
I won't go so easily!

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,298
Naruto.

37
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,926
But what do I do?

38
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,179
The Rasengan
won't work on his sword.

39
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,265
It doesn't matter.

40
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,559
Those two are waiting for my help!

41
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,812
Saving each other again, huh?!

42
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,774
They wouldn't survive
falling off this cliff.

43
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,400
Shut up!

44
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,986
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

45
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,707
Oh...you're going to run away
from here using such a diversion?

46
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,169
Don't mess with me!
Who's going to run away?

47
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:36,819
Naruto, it's futile.
That technique won't work on that sword!

48
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,862
It's futile!

49
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,873
Naruto!

50
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,961
Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,

51
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,089
why is it that each and every
Leaf Village Ninja is an idiot?

52
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,259
Shut up!

53
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,052
I'm going to save those two!

54
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,723
Are you seriously thinking
they're alive after falling off this cliff?

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,726
You should've gotten out of here.

56
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,770
As if...

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,484
I'd abandon my comrades
and run away!

58
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,156
That's my answer to the tenth problem!

59
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,908
What're you saying?

60
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,202
One more time.

61
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,165
Eat this.

62
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,834
Idiot.

63
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,335
Rasengan!

64
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,013
Naruto...!

65
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,150
You still don't get it?!
You don't have a chance of winning!

66
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,111
Damn!

67
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,457
That's...

68
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,422
the damage Sasuke inflicted.

69
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,716
That's it!

70
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,135
If I aim for that...

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,765
I can win!
You saying you still want to fight?

72
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,183
Give it up, already!

73
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,686
Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!

74
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,857
Sasuke...

75
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,694
Sasuke gave me a chance!
I won't waste it!

76
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,322
Naruto...

77
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,745
Stay still!

78
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,750
Sasuke! They're using
the Water Clone Jutsu!

79
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,544
I know!

80
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,590
Trust us, Idate!
We'll protect you, no matter what!

81
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,679
S-Sakura...

82
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,142
Go on ahead.
We'll be right behind you.

83
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,520
Sakura!

84
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,483
I...

85
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:26,530
I hate people who don't know
when to quit.

86
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,991
This is the end.

87
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,543
A foolish cheap trick.

88
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,090
What?!

89
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,263
I'm saying I can't stand this
saving each other business.

90
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,598
Idate!

91
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,268
Your opponent is over here!

92
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,438
Above!

93
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,609
Rasengan!

94
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,371
What?!

95
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,962
It can't be!

96
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,392
Naruto, you did it!

97
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,564
Naruto...

98
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,859
You're really something.

99
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,197
Yeah, well...

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,406
Sakura!

101
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,830
Naruto...! Idate...!

102
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,958
Sakura!

103
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,584
She's okay?

104
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,004
Sasuke's okay, too.

105
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,966
I'm coming to save you now,
believe it.

106
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,096
Idiot. Forget about us and
get going to the finish line, quick!

107
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,472
Oh, that's right.

108
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,559
But what should we do about this?

109
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,686
Leave it to me.

110
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,901
We'll cut the rope and go
to the opposite bank in one swing!

111
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,861
I get it!

112
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,576
I thought the worst of myself.

113
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,790
But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.

114
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,252
I trust you more than anyone.

115
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,758
It was the first time
I was trusted by someone.

116
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,222
So I wanted to win this race
for the boss, no matter what.

117
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,892
But in reality, I can't win
just with such feelings.

118
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,021
So many times along the way,
I felt like giving up.

119
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,731
Watch out!

120
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,190
But each time,

121
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,278
you guys risked your lives
to save a lame duck like me!

122
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,701
Naruto, I'm sorry.

123
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,412
I should've trusted you guys
from the start.

124
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,748
What're you saying?

125
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,709
Say stuff like that
after winning the race.

126
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,670
You're right.

127
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,799
Naruto!

128
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,726
Idate!

129
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,936
Okay, do it!

130
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,438
Right!

131
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,761
Boo! Boo! Boo!

132
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,222
Now that's a rousing welcome.

133
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,852
Naruto, at this rate,
we'll crash into the rocks!

134
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,563
I know. Leave it to me!

135
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,108
Release Chakra from
the bottom of my feet.

136
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,069
It's the very last Chakra!

137
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,825
Then stick to
the rocks with Chakra!

138
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,624
All right, Naruto!

139
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,335
Now dash to the finish line!

140
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:56,258
Sakura, I'll come back
to help you right away!

141
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,802
Okay. Let's go, Idate.
Right!

142
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,186
Run steady, Fukusuke!

143
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,938
Stay sharp until the end.

144
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,899
Shut up! I know.

145
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,696
Geez...spoiling my good mood.

146
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,536
I can see the Todoroki Great Shrine.

147
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,624
Boss!

148
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,917
Blast it!

149
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,924
Good, good.

150
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,385
Idate.

151
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,470
– Hey!
– Oh!

152
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,346
Hey! What's that?

153
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,015
Here he comes!

154
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,559
Idate of the Wasabi Family's here!

155
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,690
Go!

156
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,233
You can still catch up!

157
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,698
What?!

158
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,118
Idate!

159
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,663
Idiot!

160
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,500
What're you doing, Fukusuke?! Run!

161
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,711
Damn it!

162
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,671
I won't lose.

163
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,382
I will not lose!

164
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,516
I won't give up until the very end!

165
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,525
Like heck. I won't be passed up
after I've come this far!

166
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,904
– All right!
– He caught up.

167
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,326
Blast this guy...!

168
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,538
I won't lose, you little...!

169
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,792
Blast...

170
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,421
Idate...!

171
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,382
Come on, Idate!

172
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,259
Boss!

173
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,811
Go! Idate...!

174
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,731
All right!

175
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,524
I did it!

176
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,410
Idate.

177
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,121
You ran a fine race.

178
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:14,623
Boss!

179
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,083
You did well.

180
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,296
Boss, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

181
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,091
You fool. What're you apologizing for?

182
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,760
You won.

183
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,179
No, please let me speak.

184
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,224
I really want to apologize now.
I'm truly sorry!

185
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,355
You're making no sense to me.
What a totally weird guy.

186
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,190
Well done, Idate.

187
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,733
I was wrong about you.

188
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,695
Okay, Idate.
Go receive the winner's blessing.

189
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,280
Yes!

190
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,875
Hey, Idate!

191
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,884
Hey, you idiot!

192
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:12,514
Bringing shame upon the boss!
You're prepared, aren't you?

193
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,015
I-I'm sorry!

194
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,226
The winner!

195
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,438
Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!

196
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,612
He finally did it.

197
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,324
Hey, hey... Just a minute.

198
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,785
Kyuroku.

199
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,748
Along the way, he rode
on the back of a hired Ninja.

200
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,250
This is a violation.

201
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,835
W-What?

202
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,211
There's proof.

203
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,714
Look at this photo.

204
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:54,514
Racing until the end on your own strength
is the rule of this race.

205
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,391
Therefore, Idate is disqualified.

206
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:03,022
The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuya
of the Wagarashi Family.

207
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,191
No way.

208
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,735
H-Hold it. That was...!

209
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,864
I'll hear no excuses!
Jirocho, it's a promise.

210
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,576
I order the Wasabi Family
dissolved immediately.

211
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,579
Just a minute.

212
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,958
There is no such rule anywhere.
Do not speak nonsense!

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
M-My lord!

214
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,545
Or perhaps...

215
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:29,591
you have a reason for wanting
the Wagarashi to win at all cost?

216
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,509
No, nothing like that.

217
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,598
Could it be because you would
not be able to do things like this?

218
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,933
Look.

219
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:45,190
You fool!
Retire and enter the monastery!

220
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,525
Yes, yes, my lord!

221
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,027
Kyuroku Wagarashi.

222
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,111
Y-Yes?

223
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,573
Word of your evil deeds
has reached my ears as well.

224
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,410
Your sins against the people
of Degarashi Port are severe.

225
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:01,831
Therefore, the Wagarashi Family
is to be dissolved as of today.

226
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,249
Understood?

227
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,294
Y-Yes, sire.

228
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,298
Today is an auspicious day.

229
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,218
With this, the matter is settled.

230
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,519
Thanks for the help, Naruto.

231
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,813
Idate, this is good-bye, huh?

232
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,775
I've come to get the wounded.

233
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,902
Ibiki.

234
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,487
B-Big Brother!

235
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,697
Where are the wounded?

236
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,658
Over here.

237
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,869
Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.

238
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,454
R-Right.

239
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,999
Um, excuse me.

240
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,167
What is it?

241
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,796
N-Nothing.

242
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,842
Brother!

243
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,594
Wait, Big Brother!

244
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,098
Who are you?

245
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:05,270
The man who called me
Big Brother died three years ago.

246
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,700
Big Brother... I figured out
the answer to the tenth problem!

247
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,745
I'll never betray a comrade again!

248
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,874
I can trust others now!

249
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,092
He's looking good now.

250
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,438
'Bye, Idate. Let's meet again.

251
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,523
Good-bye. See you around.

252
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,276
Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?

253
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,737
I wish you good health, Boss!

254
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,488
Yeah...

255
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,991
See ya!

256
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,784
Take care!

257
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,664
An interesting guy as always.

258
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,710
No wonder the Fifth Hokage
sees potential in him.

259
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,423
Naruto! Thanks!

260
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:20,094
Idate! Next time,
it'll be a battle with me, believe it.

261
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,391
Sasuke, does it hurt?

262
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,018
No.

263
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,144
Thank goodness.

264
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,022
Those wounds will heal immediately
once we get back to the village.

265
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,232
Right.

266
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,277
The rumors were true.

267
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,614
The survivor of
the village's honorable Uchiha Clan...

268
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,117
is just a good-for-nothing kid...

269
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,204
I couldn't beat him!

270
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,998
And yet, he...

271
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,709
that Naruto...!

272
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,775
Once in a long while,

273
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,404
once in a while

274
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:24,993
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

275
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:30,289
Look like a mountain

276
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,921
Clinging to the Divine,

277
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,717
clinging to Buddha

278
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,597
The remnants of a person crying

279
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,560
Look like a mountain

280
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,897
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

281
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

282
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,030
Shake shake shake
Let's look

283
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

284
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,715
Look like a mountain

285
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,054
Look like a mountain

286
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,599
Look like a mountain

287
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,811
Look like a mountain

288
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,527
Hey Sasuke and Naruto,
what's happened to both of you?

289
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,907
This is a hospital,
and Sasuke's still recuperating!

290
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,909
Even you should know better, Naruto.

291
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,787
Stop the antics already!

292
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,832
Why, why's this happening?!

293
00:22:56,084 --> 00:23:01,506
Next time: "The Battle Begins:
Naruto vs. Sasuke"
