1
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:15,683
Hey boys, listen up!

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,234
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,696
so don't hide your fists

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
You're not old enough

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:39,081
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,837
Hey boys, you're the only ones

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,381
who can pull the trigger in your heart

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

11
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,976
awesome world right at this moment,

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:07,193
Don't forget every truth or lie

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,790
All the kids took off

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,420
Because they want to change something

20
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,178
Shikamaru! Ino! Choji!

21
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,223
Heh... Well...

22
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,977
It's a drag,
but it's Lady Tsunade's orders.

23
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,480
Old Lady Tsunade's...?

24
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,941
You're pursuing Mizuki, right?

25
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,901
Y-Yeah...!

26
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,654
And...who are these guys here?

27
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,116
Fujin and Raijin.

28
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,828
Fujin...and Raijin?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,249
Yeah. They're a little weak upstairs,
but their brute strength...

30
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,920
is Herculean, surpassing even that
of the Legendary Sannin.

31
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,213
Are you serious?

32
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,800
Damn... It looks like he really means it.

33
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,309
Pretty amazing that they are able
to hold out

34
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,687
against the Shadow Possession Jutsu
only by using their strength...

35
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,732
It looks like this is gonna turn
into a troublesome situation again...

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,737
Leave this to us... You go pursue Mizuki!

37
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,614
We'll be fine!
Leave it to us!

38
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:39,952
Awright!

39
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,747
But be careful!

40
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,960
Those guys are crazy like monsters!

41
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,713
Yeah... I can see that.

42
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,342
Go, Naruto!

43
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,428
Thanks, guys!

44
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,804
We better hurry, Naruto!

45
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,310
Your opponents are this way!

46
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:09,189
You guys... Doing this kind of thing
to us brothers!

47
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,275
Don't even think we're gonna
let you leave here alive!

48
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,111
Well... I wouldn't be so sure about that.

49
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,073
Choji! Ino! Let's hurry and
take care of these guys!

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,658
– Okay!
– Okay!

51
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,746
A New Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!

52
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,206
Wait, Mizuki!

53
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,171
Looks like I'm gonna
have a little fun, Iruka!

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
This way?

55
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,947
Mizuki! Where are you?

56
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,789
D-Damn!

57
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,666
This is Genjutsu...

58
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,923
Release!

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,694
After Genjutsu... Puppets come, huh?

60
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,237
His Jutsu are diverse.

61
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,199
And moreover, the timing of
his Jutsu are superb...

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,493
I was really close to being taken down...

63
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,829
I wouldn't have imagined that

64
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,124
he could have such full command
of the high level Jutsu...that Mizuki.

65
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,505
I guess I can praise you on catching that
the Puppet was real.

66
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,717
However... I wonder how long

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,928
you're gonna be able to continue
to engage in my game, Iruka!

68
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,014
Where's this...?!

69
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,483
This ain't good...

70
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,235
They're able to repel
Shadow Possession Jutsu

71
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,195
using only their strength...

72
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,581
Shikamaru, I'll go!
Choji!

73
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,542
Stop it! Their strength is unearthly!

74
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,587
I'll hold this guy down...

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,297
While I do that take care
of the other one!

76
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,675
Okay! All right, let's go, Ino!

77
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,260
Leave it to me!

78
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,764
Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu!

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,690
What's the matter, Elder Brother?

80
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,403
A success!

81
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,239
Oops...

82
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,617
All right!

83
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,080
Formation, Ino-Shika-Cho completed!

84
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,793
Elder Brother!
What's the matter, Elder Brother?!

85
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,507
Iruka Sensei...
I'll catch up with you in no time...

86
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,425
Please be safe!

87
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,976
How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?

88
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,942
Pretty good for being self-taught,
wouldn't you say?

89
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,944
I can't understand...

90
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,116
You have the ability to use
such high-level Ninjutsu to this degree...

91
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,077
why would you waste it?!

92
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,709
As always, trying to impose
your morals on me, huh...?!

93
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,420
You're so lukewarm! You're so naïve!

94
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,341
Don't you start preaching me!

95
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,345
I won't acknowledge you, no matter what!

96
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,308
I consistently hardened my heart
and carried out my missions...

97
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,311
Despite that, those guys in the village...

98
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,148
No matter how strong I was!

99
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,275
No matter how many enemies
I took down in my missions!

100
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,237
Those guys didn't even attempt
to acknowledge me!

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,489
Saying we're comrades,
it's all about teamwork...

102
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,409
They were all bound by stupid rules!

103
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,413
His target's the Secret Manuscript.

104
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,999
Backup Mizuki!
Right!

105
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,755
Hey! Are you all right?!

106
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:48,719
I-I can't feel my leg...

107
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,433
What do you think, Mizuki?

108
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,314
It's no good.
It's unfortunate, but he can no longer...

109
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,565
I see...

110
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,109
All right! Let's withdraw!

111
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,404
Hurry!
Yeah...

112
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,702
It's unfortunate, but...

113
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,455
Guys who are of no use on the battleground

114
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,123
only become a ball and chain...

115
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,542
Even though it's just a minor injury,

116
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,127
you won't be able to move from this place...

117
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,837
If you're wanna blame someone,

118
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,714
I suggest you blame
your own helpless self!

119
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,803
I simply carried out
my mission faithfully.

120
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,516
And despite that, those guys
in the village...

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,728
Not one of them even attempted
to acknowledge me...

122
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:44,441
Why?! Why didn't anybody
acknowledge my strength?!

123
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,902
Why?! Iruka...!

124
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:53,492
When you and even that Nine-Tailed brat
are acknowledged, why only me...?

125
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,787
It's still not too late.

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,498
If you pay for your crimes
and start afresh,

127
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,209
the people in the village will certainly...

128
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:07,089
How cocky! Don't preach to me!

129
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,926
You're just the same as
those other guys in the village!

130
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,928
You disdain me, don't you?!

131
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,305
Mizuki...
Everything...

132
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,101
That's right... Everything began that day...

133
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,235
What are you gonna do,
getting nervous now?

134
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,654
Mizuki...

135
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,614
It finally takes place tomorrow,
doesn't it?

136
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,450
The Academy's teacher recruitment exam...

137
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,911
Yeah... It's weighing heavily on me.

138
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,081
I'm envious of you.
Your scores are better than mine.

139
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,709
You'll breeze right through
tomorrow's exam.

140
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:49,423
Not quite... Well, in any case,
let's both do our best!

141
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,258
Yeah!

142
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,939
Damn!

143
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,032
Lie low!

144
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,910
That was close, Iruka!
Yeah...

145
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,289
Mizuki... Thank you.
You really helped me out!

146
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,000
It's mutual... Come on, let's hurry!

147
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:31,798
Ninja Academy Exam Results

148
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,928
Number 7 - Iruka Umino

149
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,724
I-I did it... I did it!

150
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,852
Mizuki...

151
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,938
Exam Office

152
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:51,026
Now then, regarding Mizuki...
we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

153
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,488
Yes, it can't be helped.

154
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,491
I agree... The questions that were raised

155
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,202
at the time of that mission to
recover the Secret Manuscript...

156
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,664
Until those are completely cleared up...
It can't be helped, can it?

157
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,001
According to the autopsy report...

158
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,253
the cause of death to that corpse
was given as suffocation.

159
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,672
In Mizuki and the others' reports,

160
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,968
it stated that the leg injury
was not that serious...

161
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,929
I understand...

162
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,015
He's brilliant but it can't be helped.

163
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,817
I was just carrying out the mission
that I was assigned to do!

164
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:38,824
Can you understand how miserable
the life I've led has been since then?!

165
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,284
Huh? Iruka?!

166
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,830
You have no idea, do you?

167
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,707
I have undergone so many hardships,

168
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,835
and you, who has had it so easy...

169
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,003
Which one of us is the true Shinobi...

170
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,047
Let's clarify that once and for all,
shall we?!

171
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,850
Now then come! Iruka!

172
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,107
Mizuki... Where are you?!

173
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,569
You don't have any intention
of reforming yourself, do you?!

174
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,239
Don't make me say the same thing
over and over again!

175
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,533
Then I'll bring this to an end now...

176
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,243
It's very unfortunate, though!

177
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,038
What a tearjerker...

178
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,124
It makes me happy too, Iruka...

179
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,097
Elder Brother?!
What's the matter, Elder Brother?!

180
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,809
Hey... You came back, Elder Brother!

181
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,146
Uh, Elder Brother?

182
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,986
What did you guys do to...
to Elder Brother?!

183
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,781
I hijacked him! Idiot!

184
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,494
Wh-What the heck...?!

185
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:11,416
What?!
Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!

186
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,714
These guys!

187
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,425
Owww...!

188
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,676
Are you okay, Ino?

189
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,305
I-I think I'm...

190
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,142
not okay! My gorgeous face is...!

191
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,105
Good grief... Gimme a break...

192
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,650
C-Choji!

193
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,653
Choji!

194
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,113
Are you okay?!

195
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,032
I-I'm fine...

196
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,744
Sorry... Feels like I fell asleep a little.

197
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,497
Hey, Elder Brother... You woke up.

198
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,749
Damn. Can't be helped...

199
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,293
Guess I have no choice but to use
that thing.

200
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,004
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

201
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,013
Elder Brother...!
H-How dare you!

202
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,399
We're close. Mizuki may have
set a trap so be careful!

203
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,109
I know that!

204
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,455
It was so much fun to be behind bars...

205
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,586
The moldiness... The dampness...
The gloominess...

206
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,093
Pitch black year round!

207
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,600
But for that very reason that
I was able master techniques

208
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,019
that an ordinary Shinobi would
not be able to possess...

209
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,895
Even in this darkness...

210
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,273
I can get an intense sense of your energy...

211
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,531
What's the matter? Are you done already?

212
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,705
There's no time to be spaced out, Iruka.

213
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm gonna take my time
and have fun with this...

214
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Take my time, got it?

215
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,597
All right! Me too!

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,892
Wait! If you go in there right now
using Mind Transfer Jutsu,

217
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,311
my Jutsu will affect you too!

218
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,982
If you think you're the only one
who's learned a new Jutsu,

219
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,776
you're very wrong!

220
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,530
Ninja Art: Mind Destruction Jutsu!

221
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,080
Wh-What's the matter, Raijin?!

222
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,587
R-Raijin... What are you doing?!

223
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,256
Heh... Not bad...

224
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,052
"Ino collection,"
my new spring season Jutsu!

225
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,978
We're close!

226
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,442
That's it! That building!

227
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,946
All right! Just one last spurt!

228
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,090
How about it?
Have your eyes adjusted a little?

229
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,552
For guys like you who have lived
their lives in the light,

230
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,595
darkness is an inconvenience, isn't it?

231
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,604
Damn! Where are you?!

232
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,657
Hey, Iruka, weren't you saying that

233
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,452
you were going to bring this to an end?

234
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,748
I see! By end,

235
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,916
you must have been
talking about yourself, huh?!

236
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,177
Heh! Just a little bit!

237
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,721
Hang in there, Ino!
Leave it to me!

238
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,683
Damn...!

239
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,316
Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!

240
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,526
Th-Those jerks...

241
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,493
I-I can't hold them any longer!

242
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,955
If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now,
everything will go to waste...

243
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,458
Think... Think about the next move...

244
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,215
Bear with it, Ino!

245
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,841
Leave it to me!

246
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,177
You're just gonna be sent flying again!

247
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,013
Ino, just be quiet and watch!

248
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,390
Even the big-boned guy can make
quite a showing once he decides to do it!

249
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,649
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

250
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,609
Both Hands!

251
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,952
Choji...

252
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,664
I can't let just Ino get
all the good parts!

253
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm the number one handsome
Big-Boned Ninja!

254
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,173
Good work, Choji! You're so cool!

255
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,634
Huh... That Choji...

256
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,097
New Formation! Ino-Shika-Cho completed!

257
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,397
It's strange...

258
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,524
Any hint of Mizuki in the air
has vanished...

259
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,901
It's too quiet...

260
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,038
That's not it...

261
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,047
Even deeper...

262
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,673
Footsteps? No... It's not ...

263
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,344
It's different from the sound
of footsteps...

264
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,430
Finer and smaller...

265
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,681
Continuous...

266
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,725
sound.

267
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,939
Paper Bombs?!

268
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,990
Wh-What is that...?!

269
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,420
Wh-What happened here?!

270
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,090
Iruka Sensei?!

271
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,217
Iruka Sensei!

272
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,195
Crappy news pass us by

273
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,532
And you become speechless

274
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,538
My voice is way too soft

275
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,165
So you don't answer

276
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

277
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

278
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

279
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,518
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

280
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,272
Yeah

281
00:21:54,355 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

282
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,698
Yeah

283
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:09,454
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

284
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,999
Yeah

285
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

286
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:25,178
Yeah

287
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,527
No way! What happened to Iruka Sensei?!

288
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,571
The scent ends here.

289
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,115
In any case,
we just have to search the perimeter.

290
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,577
Everything is in pieces. Damn it!

291
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,412
Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!

292
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,290
Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!

293
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,917
We have a company.

294
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,877
It seems someone is after us.

295
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,214
Next episode: "Orochimaru's Shadow!"
