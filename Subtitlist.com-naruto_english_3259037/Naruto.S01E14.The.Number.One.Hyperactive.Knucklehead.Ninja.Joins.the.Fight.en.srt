1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,937
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,194
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,161
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,582
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,258
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,260
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,974
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,851
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,945
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,328
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,292
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,338
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,471
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.

21
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,141
This is a Hidden Village that has produced
many superb Ninjas.

22
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:43,103
-Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?!
-You're really gonna get it this time!

23
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,649
The number one prankster of the village,
Naruto Uzumaki,

24
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,485
is a boy who is also
striving to become a first-rate Ninja.

25
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,278
I don't care!

26
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,448
Transform!

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,995
His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,747
–You fool!
-However, Naruto had a secret inside him.

29
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,083
-Stop making idiotic spells!
-that even he didn't know about.

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,297
At one time, the nine-tailed fox drove
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

31
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,341
to the brink of destruction...

32
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:20,182
That nine-tailed monster fox is
sealed within Naruto's body.

33
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,230
-Look at that one.
-Therefore, he's been abhorred

34
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,191
-I hear he's the only one who failed.
-as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.

35
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,735
Serves him right.

36
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,196
Imagine what would happen
if he becomes a Ninja.

37
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,742
Okay, you may open your eyes now.

38
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,581
Congratulations on your graduation.

39
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,375
However, that Naruto,

40
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,836
-Iruka Sensei!
-on my sufferance,

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,338
-That hurts!
-graduates from the Ninja Academy.

42
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,092
Say cheese!

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,596
He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.

44
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,185
Ninja missions are conducted
by three-man cells.

45
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,188
Sasuke Uchiha.

46
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,190
A descendant of the Uchiha clan,

47
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,484
a distinguished family in
Hidden Leaf Village.

48
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,447
He is a boy towards whom Naruto harbors
intense feelings of rivalry.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,495
Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi who
Naruto has the hots for.

50
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:31,128
As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missions
with these two rookie Ninjas.

51
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,715
The one who observes and instructs them,

52
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,594
Kakashi Hatake,
also known as the Copy Ninja,

53
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,304
is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja.

54
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,604
One day, Naruto's group takes on
the mission to guard Tazuna,

55
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,065
a master bridge-builder
of the Land of Waves.

56
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,108
All right! We're off!

57
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,571
However, Tazuna is targeted by a man
named Gato

58
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:01,200
who attempts to control
the Land of the Waves.

59
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,912
Stop your darned grumbling...!!

60
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,377
-Next time I'll kill him with...
-And Gato had hired a terrifying man

61
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,380
-head chopper!
-for Tazuna's assassination.

62
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,882
Zabuza Momochi...

63
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,176
A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Mist.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,178
He was a man who had excelled at
Silent Killing and

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,556
had successfully carried out
many assassinations.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,985
Naruto and the gang have
a tough time of it

67
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,153
in the face of Zabuza's attacks...

68
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,035
Hey! You, with no brows...

69
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,999
Record in your Bingo Book about the man

70
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,002
who'll one day become
the Leaf Village's Hokage.

71
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,839
Naruto Uzumaki!!

72
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,095
It's not so easy!

73
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,475
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow...!

74
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,897
However, the shoe is on the other foot,

75
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,400
thanks to Naruto and Sasuke's
close team work.

76
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,243
Kakashi copies
Zabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.

77
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,620
-W-What's that?!
-It breaks Zabuza's composure.
7801:05:42:2401:05:44:29
Me...?

78
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,961
R-Ridiculous!

79
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,131
Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?

80
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,094
The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!

81
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,388
No way!

82
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,995
It's over...

83
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,175
A Tracker Ninja boy
from A Hidden Mist Village

84
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,552
is the one who delivered the final blow.

85
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,099
I must get rid this corpse

86
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,393
because it contains many secrets.

87
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,188
Now then, please excuse me.

88
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,114
However, this boy, Haku...

89
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,116
was Zabuza's comrade.

90
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,035
Will you be all right the next time?

91
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,579
The next time...

92
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,207
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.

93
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,004
Kakashi who has inferred
that Zabuza is still alive,

94
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,297
gives Naruto and gang...

95
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,800
-Ready!!
-new training in preparation...

96
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,344
-Here I go!
-for Zabuza's second assault.

97
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,438
And then, One week later...

98
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,400
This mist...

99
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,111
Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!

100
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,492
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

101
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,119
So it seems.

102
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,248
The time has come!

103
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,585
Secret Jutsu...

104
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,464
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

105
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,265
Now then... I'll start.

106
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,642
Take this!

107
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,262
Naruto Uzumaki...

108
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,766
is finally here!!

109
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,937
The Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!

110
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,369
Now that I've come, you're all right!

111
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,662
Oh...

112
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,704
Naruto!

113
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:02,584
The hero of a story generally appears
in this kind of situation

114
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,671
and takes out the enemy in no time!

115
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,632
Heh... That brat, eh...

116
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,884
He's long on talk...

117
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,553
Man, that idiot!

118
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,889
Making such a conspicuous entrance...

119
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,850
There's no point if you don't
catch the enemy off guard!

120
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,396
That boy...

121
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,570
What're you doing in a place
like this from morning?

122
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,614
Training!!

123
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,993
Why are you training?

124
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,954
I want to get stronger!

125
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,878
All right, here I go! Shadow Clone Jutsu...

126
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,381
Huh?!

127
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,465
Oh, no!

128
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,427
-Huh?
-Get out of the way, Naruto!

129
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,975
-Whoa!
-What?!

130
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,439
He's saved...

131
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,233
To think the enemy attacks
would cancel each other out...

132
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,193
That was super lucky...

133
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,904
Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!

134
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,449
Hey! What kind of idiot would attempt

135
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,908
to cast a Jutsu directly
in front of an opponent?!

136
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,410
What?!

137
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,121
The essence of a Ninja is deception.

138
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,415
How you deceive your opponent.

139
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,960
Even casting one Jutsu,
you avoid the eyes of your opponents,

140
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,130
catch them off balance, and outsmart them...

141
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,344
The way you made your entrance earlier,
that's just you coming to be a target...

142
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,472
N-Nooo.

143
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,724
But I went to the trouble
of coming to the rescue.

144
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,852
What concerns me more than that is...

145
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,360
That guy...

146
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,821
Haku... What's the idea?

147
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,784
Zabuza, leave this kid to me...

148
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,746
Please let me fight this battle my way.

149
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,206
What did you say...?

150
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,700
So you mean no interfering...Haku?

151
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,582
You're naive...as usual...

152
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,168
I'm sorry...

153
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,004
Naive, eh...

154
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,423
True enough...

155
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,675
Judging from these wounds,

156
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,678
there's no mistaking that
I was attacked with a Senbon.

157
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,056
But no vital areas have
been targeted so far.

158
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,771
Does he mean to half-kill me...?

159
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,773
If so!

160
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,777
As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!

161
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,741
It's impossible. It's too much for Naruto!

162
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,743
I should be the one to...

163
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,706
Hey. Don't get any ideas...

164
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,083
If you move,

165
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,170
you know what'll happen
to that old man, right?

166
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,755
True...

167
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:40,135
If I move away from here and
head towards Naruto,

168
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,637
Zabuza will kill Tazuna.

169
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,141
No way can Sakura completely
protect him by herself.

170
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,435
How about it?

171
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:53,648
Let's just see how those young guys
fight against each other.

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,943
That mask...

173
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,572
You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,
weren't you!

174
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,033
You've got nerve to deceive us!

175
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,494
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,040
But, your teacher also said it, didn't he?

177
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,793
Things like deceiving and
catching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.

178
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,463
Please don't take it personally.

179
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,385
You don't have that luxury, either!

180
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,015
Huh?

181
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,060
Sasuke?

182
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,314
I haven't...forgotten about you.

183
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,986
Here I thought he had disappeared...
but he was there...

184
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:45,325
I would rather you had
just gone down quietly.

185
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,994
But it looks like it won't work that way.

186
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,289
Fine. I'll put an end to it first.

187
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,292
H-Hey!

188
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,421
Naruto. I'll get to you later.

189
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,096
W-What's with him...?

190
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,347
This is it!

191
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,731
So the real body is over there, eh...

192
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,108
Okay!

193
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,192
I'm over here.

194
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,325
He moved...? How?!

195
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,386
-Sasuke!
-Sasuke!

196
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,807
What was that just now?!

197
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,810
Sasuke's body suddenly got battered...

198
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,771
How's he doing it?!

199
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,238
What kind of Jutsu is he using...?

200
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,201
It's conceivable that he has clones
hide in the mirrors and

201
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,746
gets them all to throw
the Senbons simultaneously...

202
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,873
No, they're too fast considering...

203
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:15,957
What does it mean...

204
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,626
not being able to see even
the trajectory of the weapons...?

205
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,090
Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu...

206
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,094
I don't see a reason for
these ice mirrors...

207
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:35,477
In any case, there's no way to question
that these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.

208
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,902
What I can do is to launch attacks...

209
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,029
from both the outside and inside.

210
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,990
The thing to do is to figure out
the meaning of the mirror!

211
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,242
I'll take care of here!

212
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,333
All there is to do is...

213
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:04,172
for me to attack the inside and have Naruto
try attacking the mirrors from the outside.

214
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,675
Yo! I came to save you.

215
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,178
You okay, Sasuke?

216
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,390
Oh...

217
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,351
What good will it do you
to catch your ally off guard...?

218
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,229
Y-You idiot!

219
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,148
If you're a Shinobi,
you'll move more cautiously!

220
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,525
What's with you?!

221
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,360
I came to the rescue, you know!

222
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,071
If you also come inside the mirrors...

223
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,324
Dang it! I've had it, you fool!

224
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,785
Fool? What do you mean by fool?!

225
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,706
As to be expected of the
number one unpredictable Ninja.

226
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,751
He is making the situation worse and
worse by coming to aid.

227
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,796
Since it's come to this,
all that is left is to smash the mirrors!

228
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,217
-Fire Style!
-Hey! What're you going to do?!

229
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,053
These are mirrors made
with freezing water...

230
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,430
If so...

231
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,806
Fireball Jutsu!

232
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,447
It's not working at all!

233
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,908
They won't melt with that
level of firepower.

234
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:33,136
Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!
Is it the clones?

235
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,641
Where's the real body?!

236
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,686
It's useless for you to even
attempt following with your eyes.

237
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,855
I absolutely will not be caught.

238
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,691
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!

239
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,193
Don't!

240
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,574
If so, I'll find out which is
the real body by hitting them all!

241
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:22,060
This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses
mirrors that can reflect only my image.

242
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,145
Watching you from the speed I move,

243
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,023
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all...

244
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,983
I knew it!

245
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,278
Is that Jutsu...the Kekkei Genkai?!

246
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,908
Kekkei...Genkai...?

247
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,036
It's the same type as my Sharingan...

248
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,124
Deep blood ties...
Lineage of paranormal individuals...

249
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,670
A type of Jutsu that is passed on
only through those traits...

250
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,171
Then...!

251
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,840
That's right...

252
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:56,302
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu...

253
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,638
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!

254
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,686
Darn it...

255
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,857
So...what?!

256
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,485
I can't die here yet.

257
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,738
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality...

258
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,659
The dream to have my strength recognized
by everyone in the village...

259
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,786
and become the Hokage!

260
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,873
Dream...

261
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,935
Pathetic brat.

262
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:57,322
Brats like you aren't needed by anyone

263
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,867
and die without ever knowing
any freedom or dreams...

264
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,291
You have the same eyes as I do...

265
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,217
For me, becoming a Shinobi completely
is difficult.

266
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:22,263
If I can, I don't want to kill you guys...

267
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,224
And I don't want to get killed
by you guys...

268
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,520
But if you guys are going to come at me...

269
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:33,483
I'll kill my feelings with a sword and
completely become a Shinobi.

270
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,947
This bridge is the battleground
that connects each of us to our dreams.

271
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,658
I, for the sake of my dream.

272
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,869
And you, for the sake of your dreams.

273
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,830
Please don't hold it against me...

274
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,792
I want to protect the person dear to me...

275
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:56,130
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,

276
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,299
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality...

277
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,301
That's my dream.

278
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:04,222
For the sake of the dream,
I will completely become a Shinobi...

279
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,265
and kill you guys!

280
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,874
Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!

281
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,252
Cuz' I've finally discovered the way
to break through it!

282
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,171
Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.

283
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,091
Let's pull out of this place and
go assist Kakashi Sensei.

284
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,052
I've had this bad feeling from
a while ago.

285
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:10,556
Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow
until we get there.

286
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,227
Next episode:
"Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters."

287
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,854
As for me, I'll kick butt once again!
