1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,563
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,899
I just want to convey

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,446
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:39,123
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,502
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:51,177
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you,

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,928
right?

9
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,561
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,067
In time,

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:12,239
we'll realize that it was everything

14
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:18,412
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,540
Trembling thoughts

16
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:27,338
swept into a vortex and melting away

17
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,435
Okay! Drink! Sing!

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,853
Let's have fun!

19
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:47,191
Good grief...This is too much for...
a pre-celebration.

20
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,277
Did you take care of the business?

21
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,446
Yes...

22
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,659
More importantly,
the rain's starting to let up.

23
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,162
Shouldn't you quickly put an end
to this farce of a race?

24
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,332
Fine.

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,503
Guess I'll go for a run!

26
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,819
-A-Above here, huh?
-Yeah...

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,073
It's a quite a long staircase, believe it.

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,285
They're also called
the Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.

29
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,495
cool!

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,247
Let's go at a sprint!

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,508
Hey, he's kidding, right?

32
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,678
What kind of stamina does he have?

33
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,729
Boss.

34
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,233
It seems Idate is heading this way!

35
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,528
He hasn't run away,
just like you said, Boss.

36
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,448
Of course...

37
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,536
I saw potential in him.

38
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,500
Now, it's just a little more! Run Idate!

39
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,923
A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder

40
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,932
Hey...you...!

41
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,058
Huh?

42
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,976
Let me tell you...

43
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,520
It's not like I trust you
or anything yet, okay?

44
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,647
Yeah, yeah whatever.

45
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,607
It doesn't really matter to me,
believe it.

46
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,863
There's a person
who still trusts you, right?!

47
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,329
During the Chunin Exam...

48
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,581
Huh?

49
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:11,126
You said that a tenth problem
appeared, right?

50
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:17,049
Yeah. It was a weird problem to determine
whether you'd take the problem or not.

51
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,552
Three years ago...

52
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,014
I got a similar problem...

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,895
Okay, now I'm going to
give the tenth problem.

54
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,481
The tenth problem...

55
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,443
What kind of problem is
Big Brother going to give?!

56
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,029
The tenth problem is a battle

57
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,449
with the Three-Man Squad
you were teamed up with.

58
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:48,330
The three of you will compete against
each other this exercise.

59
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:53,043
And among you... one of you will be failed!

60
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,715
And the one who is failed
will remain a Genin for life

61
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,926
and we will never again
let them take the Chunin Exam!

62
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,636
N-No way...

63
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,723
Then for what purpose
were we together until now?

64
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,100
I make the rules here.

65
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,102
Back-talk is not allowed at all!

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,565
If you want to withdraw, you should do so.

67
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:20,404
Withdrawing here and
waiting half a year is also a way.

68
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,035
If one person among the three withdraws,

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,829
of course all three members
will be disqualified.

70
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,415
But you will be allowed
to take the Chunin Exam

71
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,834
one more time, in half a year.

72
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,046
So, what will you do?

73
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,009
One comrade will be dropped.

74
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,262
I have the confidence to pass.

75
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,602
But, one of them will remain
a Genin for life.

76
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,362
It's a choice between
comrades and your life.

77
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,490
If you're going to quit, now's the time.

78
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,996
Is there nobody else
who's going to withdraw?

79
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,291
We're good, then.

80
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,465
Okay, to everyone who has remained here...

81
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,885
I render you disqualified!

82
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,846
Wh-Why...?

83
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,182
H-Hold on a minute!

84
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,476
I prepared myself and remained here!

85
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,354
Such preparedness is below contempt!

86
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,858
Scums like you don't have
the qualifications to become Chunin!

87
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,735
That's all!

88
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,781
I see...

89
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,826
What kind of a test was it for you guys?

90
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,997
I forgot...

91
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,710
I mean, it was explained to me,
but I didn't really get it.

92
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,756
Trusting in my big brother's words,
I remained in the classroom.

93
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,758
And yet I was failed!

94
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,722
No way could I take that.
I questioned my big brother.

95
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,892
Big Brother! What's up with that test?!

96
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,146
A Shinobi reads the double bluff.

97
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,316
You should've understood
that was the test.

98
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,861
Even so, I can't accept that!

99
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,279
No matter how dangerous,

100
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,198
isn't it necessary to have
the courage to plunge into any mission?!

101
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,491
Idate.

102
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,996
Can you really not accept it?

103
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,457
Of course not, such a...

104
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,170
You...quit as a Ninja.

105
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,717
If you're telling me to quit, then I will.

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,845
But tell me why I'm no good!

107
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,848
That's something you should
realize yourself,

108
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,934
with your own power.

109
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,441
To this day...I don't understand
the answer to that.

110
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,527
So after that,
you were deceived by Aoi, huh?

111
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,238
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,245
We made it...to the top!

113
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,459
I'm going by myself from here. You rest!

114
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,545
Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!

115
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,090
I can't be asking you guys
to help any more.

116
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,594
There's no point if I don't win by myself,
on my own strength!

117
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,638
Oh...hey! Idate!

118
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,642
I can make it! It seems
Sakura's special medicine has worked!

119
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,273
Blast! This doesn't hurt!

120
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,446
I'm back in the game... from here!

121
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,964
If we cross this suspension bridge,
it's Ouzu Island, huh?

122
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,715
We should hurry.

123
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,219
It seems Idate has made it
to the Modoroki Shrine.

124
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,595
What?!

125
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,807
It seems we underestimated
the Leaf Genin a bit...

126
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,061
You jerk! You didn't finish them?!

127
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,189
Now's not the time to be talking
about stuff like that.

128
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,066
Please cross the bridge quickly!

129
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
Useless Ninja!

130
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,576
Hey! I'm only helping you
because it's the job.

131
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,664
I'll waste you if you keep
talking smart to me.

132
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,666
I-I'm sorry...

133
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,335
If you've understood, then get a move on!

134
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,628
Y-Yes!

135
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,761
There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!

136
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,768
This is quite something.

137
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,980
I never thought you'd make it this far.

138
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,442
That's the... Blade of the Thunder God!

139
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:19,995
Stop!

140
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,915
Stop!

141
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,463
Stop kicking a dead horse.

142
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,175
Nobody is a match for
the legendary Blade of the Thunder God,

143
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,136
said to have been used
by the Second Hokage.

144
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,224
You should know this well.

145
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,645
After all, you're the man
who stole this for me.

146
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,107
Blast...

147
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,241
Mud balls, huh?
It's just like a kid's fight.

148
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,578
Sorry, I didn't have any Kunai Knives.

149
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,038
Naruto...

150
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,502
But you won't be able to dodge
the next ball just with that.

151
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,253
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

152
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,012
He's concentrating the Chakra in his palm.

153
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,391
Here I come!

154
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,060
Here I come!

155
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,233
Once more!

156
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,663
I don't know what you intend to do, but...

157
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,796
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!

158
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,759
Too bad.

159
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,471
This Blade of the Thunder God
cuts through anything!

160
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,099
Even Chakra itself is no exception.

161
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,767
Naruto!

162
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,564
I have to make doubly sure

163
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,566
so that nothing troublesome
will happen again.

164
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,237
I'm your opponent!
Keep your hands off Idate!

165
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,407
Humph, are you still saying such things?

166
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,870
Saving each other, protecting each other,
trusting each other.

167
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,913
It ticks me off!

168
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,918
The weak can't survive
if they don't support each other.

169
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,755
So they trust people easily
and are betrayed.

170
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,969
Weaklings like you guys
should just run about and away.

171
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,762
Right, Idate?

172
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,850
It was like that also when you stole

173
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,226
this Blade of the Thunder God, right?

174
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,862
I can see it.
That's the Village Hidden in the Rain.

175
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,450
Aoi Sensei?!

176
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,121
Aoi Sensei!

177
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,542
Idate...

178
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,294
B-Big Brother...

179
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,505
You idiot!

180
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,757
Go back to the village immediately
and surrender yourself!

181
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,719
You?!

182
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,722
Do you know what you have done?

183
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,017
What?!

184
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,274
Strict as always, eh?
And he's your cute little brother.

185
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,111
But it's truly perfect that
you've shown up here.

186
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,572
Aoi Sensei...

187
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,367
This forbidden Jutsu scroll
can't be deciphered

188
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,411
unless you're Jonin class.

189
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,540
I'll have the brothers
betray the Leaf Village together.

190
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,977
Ibiki, please decipher it already.

191
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,853
I refuse.

192
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,107
So are you choosing death,
together with Idate?

193
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,320
Such as he is, he's also a Shinobi.

194
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,031
He's not afraid of death.

195
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,371
It doesn't seem so.

196
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,999
This face is one taut with fear.

197
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:40,755
I'm quitting as a Ninja!
So please don't kill me!

198
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,300
Please decipher it.

199
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,094
You don't want to see
your cute little brother killed

200
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,429
before your eyes, do you?

201
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,682
Little brother, you say?

202
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,394
-That fool?
-Big Brother...

203
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,398
Such a threat means nothing to me.

204
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,905
Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hidden
in the Leaves that important?

205
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,826
Even if you protect it at
the risk of your own life,

206
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,454
you're nothing but a pawn!

207
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,291
So that's why you became a traitor?

208
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,419
You're a pathetic man!

209
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,004
You punk!

210
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,352
Idate!

211
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,771
You, run away!

212
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,231
What about you, Big Brother?

213
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,859
I'll go, after I clean up the mess here!

214
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,694
I don't think so!

215
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,871
Big Brother!

216
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,706
Go, quickly!

217
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,166
But Big Brother...!

218
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,127
Go! Having you stay is a burden!

219
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,549
I won't let you!

220
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,009
Go!

221
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,501
So appalling...

222
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,004
that he'd risk
his life for such an idiotic guy.

223
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,758
All you could do after that was run.

224
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,470
You could've returned
to the village and called for help.

225
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,973
But you didn't do that.

226
00:16:55,056 --> 00:17:00,145
Thinking Ibiki was dead was no excuse!

227
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,439
The fact is, he was alive...

228
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,276
In that regard, Ibiki was admirable.

229
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,612
Not only did he completely endure
repeated interrogation,

230
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,406
but he also retrieved
the Forbidden Jutsu scroll...

231
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,118
without having confessed to anything!

232
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,291
And to think that he did all this

233
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,836
for his good-for-nothing little brother.

234
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,340
You betrayed your village,
abandoned your older brother,

235
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,968
and came to think of only yourself.

236
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:38,641
Even Ibiki who is blood-related
and risked his life to save you,

237
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,852
you didn't trust him!

238
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,938
Afraid of being accused,

239
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,984
you didn't trust the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, your birthplace...

240
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,445
You trust nobody.

241
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,907
You're not trusted by anyone.

242
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,161
For me, there is no pupil
as excellent as you.

243
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,414
As a reward,
I'll let you die in one instant.

244
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,798
Idate!

245
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,800
Sasuke...Sakura!

246
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,344
Rest, Naruto!

247
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,763
I'll beat this guy!

248
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,308
Don't be acting cool, believe it.

249
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,313
You can't beat me, no matter
how many people show up.

250
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,273
Me, Aoi Rokusho,

251
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,277
the Rain Jonin who possesses
the Blade of the Thunder God.

252
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,154
Is that so?

253
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,950
Interesting.

254
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,245
The Blade of the Thunder God
and my Chidori!

255
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,206
Let's test which is better!

256
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,181
The rumors were true.

257
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,476
The survivor of the village's honorable
Uchiha Clan...

258
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,687
is just a good-for-nothing kid...

259
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,278
Sasuke!

260
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,654
Run, Sakura!

261
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,281
He'll show no mercy,
no matter who the person is.

262
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,868
-Everyone will be killed!
-No way!

263
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,452
Huh?!

264
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,538
We'll protect you, no matter what.

265
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,039
We promised that, didn't we?!

266
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,709
Trust us!

267
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,169
Now all that's left is the wounded rabbit

268
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,255
and the excellent pupil, huh?

269
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,217
You two together, go to the next world.

270
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,679
Take it back!

271
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,850
Take it back!

272
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,853
What're you talking about?

273
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,813
What you said...

274
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,816
earlier!

275
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,861
Don't mess...

276
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:59,449
with the Uchiha...with me!

277
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,875
Why you...!

278
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,651
Sasuke!

279
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,989
Sasuke! Get up!

280
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,327
How very cold the bottom
of the ocean must be.

281
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,870
Stop!

282
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,873
Idate!

283
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,631
Sakura!

284
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,472
Sakura!

285
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,733
Once in a long while,

286
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,404
once in a while

287
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:25,243
The remnants of a person broken by dreams

288
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:30,665
Look like a mountain

289
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,963
Clinging to the Divine,

290
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,800
clinging to Buddha

291
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:46,681
The remnants of a person crying

292
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,601
Look like a mountain

293
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,981
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

294
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,152
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

295
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,488
Shake shake shake Let's look

296
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:06,325
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

297
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,757
Look like a mountain

298
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,012
Look like a mountain

299
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,640
Look like a mountain

300
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,811
Look like a mountain

301
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,734
What the heck should we do?

302
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,402
That sword of the Second Hokage
won't budge an inch

303
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,531
even with Sasuke's Chidori or my Rasengan!

304
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,577
But I can't lose this battle.

305
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,579
I won't run away, no matter what!

306
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:56,626
If my techniques aren't going to work,
I'll just have to keep trying!

307
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,964
Next time: "The Last Leg:
A Final Act of Desperation"
