1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,763
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,173
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,141
We're speeding through life,

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,394
squeezing it for all of its worth

14
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,645
Our feet are tied

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,733
But we still keep going farther

16
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,611
Even if I take it back,

17
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,405
and grasp it

18
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,414
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,639
It's a custom where balance

22
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,891
is preserved
by fighting and removing life.

23
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,019
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.

24
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,855
This is a fight for life with the pride
of the village

25
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,900
and one's own dream on the line.

26
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:51,654
Heh, I'm convinced.

27
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,405
Anything is fine.

28
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,619
Just tell us the content
of that fight-for-life test.

29
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,620
Very well.

30
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:04,208
Now then, this is where I'd
like to explain the third exam.

31
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,543
But actually...

32
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,882
Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was
given the task of judge,

33
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,467
to speak first.

34
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,678
I leave it to you...

35
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,807
There's something...I'd like you all
to do...

36
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,435
before the third exam.

37
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,486
And that is a preliminary
to the third exam,

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,406
with participation in
the main battle on the line.

39
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,492
Preliminary?

40
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,453
What do you mean...preliminary?!

41
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,375
Sensei, I don't understand
the point of that preliminary.

42
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,171
Why aren't we doing the next exam
with the remaining test-takers?

43
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,966
This time around,

44
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,428
perhaps because the first and
second exams were easy,

45
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,056
there are a few too many
people left, you see.

46
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,977
In accordance with the rules
of the Chunin Exams,

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,023
a preliminary will be held in order to
reduce the number advancing.

48
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,025
N-No way!

49
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,862
As Lord Hokage said before,

50
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,783
many guests will be coming
to the third exam.

51
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,455
So we can't have long pointless matches
and our time is limited as well.

52
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:30,169
Therefore, those of you
not in top physical condition...

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,298
Hey, is he okay...?!

54
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,760
The teacher doesn't look well himself?!

55
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,678
Excuse me.

56
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:44,975
Those of you who wish to drop out,
please speak up now.

57
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,228
The preliminary will
begin immediately, so...

58
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,897
Immediately, you say...?!

59
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,610
But we finally made it through
the second exam.

60
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,362
This is a pain...

61
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,864
Huh? What about our meal?

62
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:07,081
Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,834
Okay!

64
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,253
I'm going to do my best, no matter what!

65
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,547
I promised Kabuto, too...

66
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,134
And oh...

67
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:23,138
I forgot to mention this, but it will
be individual battles from now on.

68
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,935
It is your decision, so feel free
to raise your hands and drop out.

69
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,813
Who's going to quit?!

70
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,608
Sasuke?!

71
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,947
The waves of pain are
coming faster...

72
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,076
Sasuke... I knew it.

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,122
Sasuke, you should quit
these preliminaries!

74
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,374
Huh?!

75
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,877
L-Look, you haven't been yourself
ever since you got worked over

76
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,587
by that Orochimaru guy!

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,300
That bruise hurts even now, right...?

78
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,136
Bruise...?

79
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,346
At this rate...!

80
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,063
I gave him a parting gift.

81
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,527
Sasuke will definitely seek me...
in search of power.

82
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,920
You're the only one left.

83
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,382
Please...

84
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,554
Please, quit!

85
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm...scared.

86
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,561
Sakura...

87
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,358
I knew it.

88
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,527
What shall we do?

89
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,905
We should remove him
from the exams

90
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,616
and isolate him with
Anbu bodyguards on him.

91
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,451
We should recommend that
he retire immediately.

92
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:12,623
He's not the kind of type to
just obey like that...?!

93
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,585
After all, he's of the Uchiha clan.

94
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,921
What're you talking nonsense for?!

95
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,547
I'll make him stop, by force if needed!

96
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,967
The Curse Mark responds even
when one's just building up Chakra

97
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,553
and attempts to forcibly
extract his strength!

98
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,015
It's a prohibited Jutsu that eats
into the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!

99
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,353
It's a wonder that kid is even enduring it.

100
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,482
He should really already be dead!

101
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,275
Lord Hokage!

102
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:46,824
You're in no condition to
fight properly, Sasuke...!

103
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:47,908
Shut up.

104
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,868
I understand!

105
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,829
Be quiet!

106
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,790
But you've been enduring the pain
this whole time, right?!

107
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,543
Please be quiet!

108
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,212
No matter what you say, Sasuke...

109
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,215
I'm going to tell the teachers
about the bruise!

110
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,509
If I do that...

111
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,180
Well...

112
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,640
Oh...?!

113
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,142
What...?

114
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,606
Excuse me...I'll quit.

115
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,278
K-Kabuto...?

116
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,200
Let's see...

117
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,789
Kabuto Yakushi of
the Leaf Village, correct?

118
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,000
Then, you may step back.

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,751
Okay.

120
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:41,962
Kabuto!

121
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,464
Why're you quitting?!

122
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,466
Tell me! Why?!

123
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,095
This guy...

124
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,182
I'm sorry, Naruto...

125
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:57,144
But my body is worn out.

126
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,690
Actually before the first exam...

127
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,609
when I wrangled with
the guys from Sound Village,

128
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,278
I've had no hearing at all in my left ear.

129
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,449
To fight right away...

130
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,828
and to be told that my life would
also be on the line, I can't go on.

131
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,088
I've seen that face a few times.

132
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:30,510
As I recall, I think he dropped out
of the main battle before, as well.

133
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,597
What in the world is he thinking?

134
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,183
Anko.

135
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,267
Uh...yes.

136
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,396
Kabuto Yakushi.

137
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,734
According to the data,
he has failed six straight times.

138
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,695
What about his background?

139
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,781
From his time at the Academy,

140
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,866
he was a student who did
not really stand out,

141
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,576
and his grades were ordinary.

142
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,746
He finally passed the graduation
exam on his third try.

143
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,582
After that, as for the missions
he carried out,

144
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,961
two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.

145
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,130
It's not a battle record to
write home about.

146
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,883
However...

147
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,010
However...?

148
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,596
It's about before the Academy.

149
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,056
Hmm?

150
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,058
Do you remember the story...

151
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:24,064
about the one boy brought back
from the Kikyo Pass battle?

152
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,817
I remember.

153
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,113
As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor
at the battlefield

154
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,534
was taken back by a Jonin from
the medical unit.

155
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,495
So he's that boy...?

156
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,081
Don't take arbitrary actions.

157
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,459
Have you forgotten
Orochimaru's orders?

158
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,170
I leave it to you guys.

159
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,214
You in particular, Yoroi.

160
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,927
There should be no problems
here with your ability.

161
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,348
This is where you can
show your strength.

162
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:03,478
Those of you who are irritated that
I'm ahead of you.

163
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,774
So you're Orochimaru's favorite, huh?

164
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,152
Don't get all high and mighty, kid.

165
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,362
I understand, Yoroi sir.

166
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,870
Oh.

167
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,957
Naruto... Sasuke...

168
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,627
I wanted to play with you guys
a little more.

169
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,047
But if I do more than this...

170
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,966
The old me might get stirred up.

171
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,470
I am a spy so far as it goes.

172
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,766
I cannot expose myself, here.

173
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,728
Also...if you are going to watch.

174
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,565
My role of information collecting
has served its purpose...

175
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,984
Master Orochimaru.

176
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,156
I'll save the fun, for some other time...

177
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,158
Sasuke...

178
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,952
And Naruto...

179
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,080
You too.

180
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:22,015
Now then, there are no others
who will quit?

181
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,479
I must tell the teachers,
about Sasuke's bruise!

182
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,484
Huh?!

183
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,405
Be quiet about this bruise.

184
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,039
Why're you acting tough like that?!

185
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't want to watch you suffer
all the time anymore!

186
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,336
For me you are...!

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,047
This has nothing to do with you!

188
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,009
It's none of your business.

189
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,559
I said it once before...

190
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,648
I'm an avenger.

191
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,445
This is not just a mere exam to me.

192
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,115
The Chunin business has
nothing to do with me.

193
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,540
"Am I strong?"
All I want is the answer to that.

194
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,334
By fighting with those who are strong!

195
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,586
And...

196
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,174
I'm Gaara of the desert.

197
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,385
Hey, you there...
Identify yourself.

198
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,471
I declare.

199
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,098
You are absolutely no match for me.

200
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:50,395
If I have the opportunity to fight you
in the next exam,

201
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,190
we won't run or hide.

202
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,944
And they're...here!

203
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,826
I will not allow even you

204
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,787
to take my path away from me!

205
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,123
Sasuke...

206
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,334
You!

207
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,794
What're you doing putting up
a front, you idiot?!

208
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,546
Here Sakura is this worried about you...!

209
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,006
Naruto!

210
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,469
I want to fight you, too.

211
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,762
Huh?!

212
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,148
What Orochimaru said
is sitting on my mind.

213
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,484
I will let Sasuke do the test...

214
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,027
– and see how things go.
– Wha...?!

215
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,403
L-Lord Hokage...!

216
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,324
However, if the Curse Mark opens

217
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,035
and the power gets even a little bit
out of control,

218
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,162
-get in there and stop it.
-All right.

219
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,497
But...!

220
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,376
I understand.

221
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,678
Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.

222
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,848
The preliminaries to come
will be one-on-one individual battles.

223
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,311
In other words,
actual battle format.

224
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:19,526
There are now exactly twenty people,
so we will conduct ten battles.

225
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,656
The winners will be able to
advance to the third exam.

226
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,117
There are no rules at all.

227
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,120
You will fight until someone dies,

228
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,623
collapses...or admits defeat.

229
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:39,087
And...please admit defeat right away
if you don't want to die.

230
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,175
However, in case I judge
that a match is over...

231
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,098
err...I don't want to needlessly increase
dead bodies,

232
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,309
so I will intervene and stop the match
or something to that effect.

233
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,812
What holds the key to your destinies is...

234
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,817
Open it.

235
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,453
This.

236
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,374
The names of two foes will be
randomly selected and

237
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,629
displayed on this electronic signboard.

238
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,299
Now then, let's get right down to it

239
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,594
and announce the two names
for the first battle.

240
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,774
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha

241
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,736
To think it'd be so soon...?!

242
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,158
I couldn't ask for more.

243
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,951
No way...!

244
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,620
Why Sasuke?!

245
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,547
Now then, the two displayed
on the signboard, come forward.

246
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,764
For the 1st battle,

247
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,601
Yoroi Akado and
Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.

248
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,853
No objections, right?

249
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,231
– Right.
– No!

250
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,953
All I can do now is watch...

251
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,747
Sasuke...

252
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,582
Sasuke!

253
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,336
If you want to fight me, don't lose!

254
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,841
Sasuke... You're acting strange...

255
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,552
Is it because of the Curse Mark...?

256
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,805
Sasuke, do your best!

257
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,599
I guess I'll wait and see...

258
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,730
The pain won't go away!

259
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,942
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.

260
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,905
Now then, we will begin the first battle.

261
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,619
Everyone other than the two foes,

262
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,997
please move to the upper area.

263
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,926
Hey! Kakashi Sensei!

264
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,721
Sasuke!

265
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,889
Huh?

266
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,726
Don't use the Sharingan.

267
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,396
So you knew?

268
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,941
If that Curse Mark on your neck
gets out of control,

269
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,777
it could endanger your life.

270
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,905
I believe it.

271
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,825
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.

272
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,078
I'll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.

273
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,581
Called off, you say?!

274
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:09,005
It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my Chakra.

275
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:20,058
This is my final Chakra...

276
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,601
Sharingan!

277
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,318
Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!

278
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,363
If I carelessly build up Chakra,

279
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,198
it would extract my spirit energy,

280
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,992
and bring out the Chakra
inside my body to no end.

281
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,872
In other words, in this match,

282
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:47,710
I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,
not to mention the Sharingan!

283
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,591
However...

284
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:58,596
Yoroi's ability is
the worst for you, Sasuke.

285
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,480
Now then... How will I go...?

286
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,412
Don't act rashly...Sasuke.

287
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,665
Now then, please begin.

288
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,375
Let's go!

289
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,711
Yeah!

290
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,936
Oh no!

291
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,949
He did it!

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,043
My strength...?!

293
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,847
W-What is this?

294
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,558
My body strength has suddenly...!

295
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,604
Sasuke!

296
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,205
Sasuke...!

297
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,167
You...my Chakra...

298
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,129
You just noticed now...?

299
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:10,395
Hey, can you hear it?

300
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,106
The clear,

301
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:18,987
blue sky goes on and on

302
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:26,703
The ocean spans limitlessly

303
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:35,878
Please keep that smile on your face forever

304
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:43,428
Or else I'll cry

305
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,390
You won't have to search around you

306
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,352
It's all ok now.

307
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:56,983
Everyone is inside

308
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,236
this hand

309
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,366
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

310
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,954
When you forget what happiness is

311
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,958
Just sing.

312
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,130
Light is born, and darkness was born

313
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,340
The two are one

314
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:28,264
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

315
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,561
Hey, can you hear it?

316
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,276
Dang it!
The pain won't go away!

317
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,905
This darned Curse Mark is
responding all the time!

318
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,158
But I won't let this
exam get called off!

319
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,161
How will I do?
How should I fight?

320
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,205
Am I strong?

321
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,040
All I want is the answer to that.

322
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,627
I won't let this thing swallow me up
in a place like this!

323
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,340
Next episode: "Bushy-Brow's Jealousy ...
Lions Barrage Unleashed!"
