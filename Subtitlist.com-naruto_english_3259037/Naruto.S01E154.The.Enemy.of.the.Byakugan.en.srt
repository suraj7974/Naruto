1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,583
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,713
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,014
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
with
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,826
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,247
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:35,429
The Enemy of the Byakugan

16
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,325
They blew up...
They blew up and died!

17
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,121
As I expected, I'm not sad.

18
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,791
You really can't hold funerals
feeling like this, huh...

19
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,132
Four of them are still alive.

20
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,136
Can't be! After being hit
by my Lightning Fang...

21
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,180
No...

22
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,766
If you say so, it has to be true.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,394
One...is troublesome...

24
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:33,112
The enemy was nearby...
But I couldn't see anything.

25
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,990
It's strange...

26
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,368
Even if it's the Hidden Mist Jutsu,

27
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,537
my Byakugan should be able
to see through it.

28
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,540
Byakugan!

29
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,458
For sure this time...

30
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
I can see it!

31
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,258
Southwest 52 degrees 2!

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,846
Southeast 12 degrees 3!

33
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,267
Southeast 8 degrees 1!

34
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:08,188
Northwest 24 degrees 11!

35
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,029
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

36
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,699
Let's go!

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,661
Leaf Hurricane!

38
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,834
No way!

39
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,132
Why?!

40
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,850
U-zu-ma-ki Barrage!

41
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:47,937
I missed!

42
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,356
H-Help me!

43
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,068
Bushy Brow...?

44
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,613
Th-The enemy disappeared!

45
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,503
It can't be...
The false images with Chakra Networks?

46
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:20,094
One at the middle of the cliff,
one at the bottom of the cliff,

47
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,514
one on the right, one on the left.

48
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,683
We can't hold funerals,

49
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,936
but I'll take care of them
without leaving any trace.

50
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,859
Thunder Funeral: Feast of Lightning!

51
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,627
The corpses are warm.

52
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,007
We're strong...you and I.

53
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,677
No, it's you.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,433
Ranmaru, you're strong.
With you I'm also strong.

55
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:12,104
Wait... They aren't dead yet.
They're just unconscious.

56
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,732
They're stubborn.

57
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,944
Okay, if grilling doesn't work,
then let's chop them.

58
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,949
Flesh and even bone...
I'll crush them nicely.

59
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,123
Ranmaru...! Are you all right?!

60
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,589
Hang in there, Ranmaru!

61
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,007
Ranmaru...!

62
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,010
I'm okay.

63
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,637
Raiga...

64
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,141
This person...is still unconscious.

65
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,101
What did you say?

66
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,939
It's amazing...

67
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,525
He is fighting
only with muscle memory.

68
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,529
It's a nice face.
It burns into my heart.

69
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,991
Let's hold a funeral for him...

70
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,952
I am sure it will be one
that will make me cry!

71
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,412
From the right!

72
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,289
What's with this guy...?

73
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,416
He's hard to read. The moves...

74
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,544
But for your sake, Raiga,
I'll do my best.

75
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,047
Together, okay!

76
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,381
Left! Right!

77
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,509
From the front! Jump! Now!

78
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,556
You...you...you!

79
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,353
-What?
-How can this guy... get to this point?

80
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,910
B-Bushy Brows...

81
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,339
Lee...
Could he have lost consciousness...?

82
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,632
Tenten! Neji!

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,518
Raiga! Turn around!

84
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,521
What...? That voice right now...?

85
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,818
-Wha–?!
-Raiga!

86
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,069
Ranmaru!

87
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,573
-This is...
-Neji...

88
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,032
Ranmaru!

89
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,325
Move!

90
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,873
Huh? Somehow...it felt like
I was fighting in my dreams...

91
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,501
Ranmaru...

92
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,549
You!

93
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,056
Naruto Uzumaki arrives!

94
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,600
Naruto...

95
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,852
Just die already...

96
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,022
Hey! I have something
I want to ask you!

97
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,942
You... I heard you're one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

98
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,740
So what if I was?!

99
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,075
You know Zabuza, right?!

100
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,955
You also know...
one called Kisame, right?!

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,922
I...hate them!
Who wants to remember them?!

102
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,341
I hate you too!

103
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,261
Then!
I'll make you tell me by force!

104
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,766
A clone?!

105
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,186
You... You're weaker
than a moment ago.

106
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,024
Wh-What...?

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,859
Lightning Ball!

108
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,036
Damn...

109
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,330
you are tough...

110
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,999
Lightning Ball!

111
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,595
Seconds, please...

112
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,447
Grandma Sansho?

113
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,283
What's wrong?

114
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,911
Oh my. That's bad lightning.

115
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,291
It was flashing like that too when
Karashi went to the village.

116
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,628
Oh my...that light is like poison...

117
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,719
Naruto!

118
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,479
It's not...working at all.

119
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,112
I'm not going to
remember your smile!

120
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,196
Die!

121
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,577
Ranmaru...where are you?

122
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,873
What is in this bag...?

123
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,584
Byakugan!

124
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,633
There's...in here...

125
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,473
Could it be?

126
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,486
This powder was...
hiding the Chakra Networks?

127
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,410
It's even creating the Chakra Network!

128
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,878
Naruto!
Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

129
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,715
But he saw all the shadow clones...

130
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,594
Don't worry.
His eyes are right here!

131
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,641
Ranmaru! I'm gonna come save you
after I defeat this guy!

132
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,685
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

133
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,607
Come bring it on!

134
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,111
Lightning Ball!

135
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,573
What? Was the one before a lucky hit?

136
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:42,285
Stop messing around.
All I have to do is defeat you all, right?!

137
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,663
Let's go!

138
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,166
We're not done yet!

139
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,043
You...

140
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,380
At this rate...my Chakra will...

141
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,135
The mist...
The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away...

142
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,303
Damn! I'll finish them off at once!

143
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,265
Damn!

144
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,355
I am not going to let you get away!

145
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,776
Wait!

146
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,571
Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche.

147
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,661
Naruto!

148
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,416
Naruto...

149
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,801
-Did you see that...?!
-Yeah, I saw it!

150
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,761
Prepare yourself!

151
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,805
Stop it!

152
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,934
I can't stop!

153
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
I...did it.

154
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,450
This is...Raiga's eye...?

155
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,330
Such a big eye ball!

156
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,414
Huh?

157
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,416
You're wrong...
It's a human being!

158
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,380
Huh...?!

159
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,050
In my dream...

160
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,470
I guess you were the one
I was fighting against.

161
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,307
It wasn't me...
It was Raiga and me together...

162
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,017
Together...?

163
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,229
Always...since that time...

164
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:10,767
Don't act like you're asleep.
You are going to die...

165
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,104
Don't move!

166
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,149
There is a spy in this village
who snuck into the Hidden Mist Village...

167
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,194
We came to kill those guys, but...

168
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:28,577
I got confused about who I had to kill.
That's why I am doing it randomly...

169
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,374
Wh-What are you saying?

170
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,339
It's fine...
If I am going to be killed by you.

171
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,594
Why is it fine for me to kill you...?

172
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,556
You were...always crying...

173
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,559
Huh? Me...cry?

174
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,523
In your heart...
seeking the meaning of living.

175
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:04,154
I was always watching...you.

176
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,741
What...are you?

177
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,997
I am the same as you...
living is painful.

178
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,207
I don't understand
the meaning of living.

179
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,878
Because of my sickness,
I couldn't go outside...

180
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,921
Shunned by everyone,

181
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,716
all I could do was to take
a peek of the world from this blanket...

182
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,927
But ...if with my death,

183
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:33,266
if you are able to feel
the meaning of life even a little...

184
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,647
My life was not needed
from the beginning.

185
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,610
Please...

186
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,240
Are you...alone?

187
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,038
Come with me.

188
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:02,087
From now on,
you and I are two as one.

189
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:12,430
From that day on,
I became Raiga's eyes and ears.

190
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,188
Raiga became my hands and feet.

191
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,445
The outside world that I dashed
into for the very first time...

192
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,867
it was filled with things
I had never seen or heard before.

193
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,662
It was fun.

194
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,086
Whenever and wherever,
I was with Raiga.

195
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,672
No matter when it was,

196
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,591
there wasn't a time
that we were separated.

197
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,751
We were trying to find the meaning of life
by living for each other.

198
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,212
We were convinced that
was the meaning to living.

199
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,723
That's why...

200
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,268
If Raiga is not around,

201
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,146
I no longer have the power
to live by myself.

202
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,025
I've lost the purpose to live...

203
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,113
Do you have someone
precious to you?

204
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,201
I want to protect
someone important to me...

205
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,705
I want to make his dream come true,
and that's my dream.

206
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,336
Often people have it wrong...

207
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,174
mistakenly believing that showing mercy
to an enemy is kindness.

208
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,593
They spare the foe
whose life is in their hands.

209
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,474
It's not mercy to me at all...

210
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,646
Do you know the agony

211
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:30,568
of just living
without dreams and being unwanted?

212
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,112
What are you saying?

213
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:38,117
Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.

214
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,913
You've taken away my reason for living.

215
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,375
I no longer need to live.

216
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,340
Don't say such stupid things.

217
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:58,012
Naruto... Please kill me!

218
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,222
Huh?

219
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,558
What are you doing?

220
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,980
Now, quickly.

221
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,483
Why are you hesitating...?

222
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,321
With my arms and legs torn apart,
I have no means to resist, you know.

223
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,870
You should carry out your mission...

224
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,247
Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.

225
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,922
Our mission is to force out
the Kurosuki Family from this village...

226
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,219
Without Raiga, he cannot be
of any threat to this village.

227
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,808
The problem right now is that

228
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,352
the Kurosuki Family members
have lost their leadership.

229
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,356
Once the hoop comes off,
we don't know what they will do.

230
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,532
For this mission...
this is the finishing touch.

231
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,372
Yeah, but what are we
going to do with him?

232
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,092
Is he a villain worth tying up?

233
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,094
No, he is not.

234
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,513
He might kill himself, right?

235
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,310
Once the mission is over,
we will come save you right away...

236
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,319
A Chakra Sealing tag?

237
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,864
We can't help it.
He is an enemy, after all...

238
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:45,411
We should assume he has other Jutsu.
Just in case!

239
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,615
So many things happen

240
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:28,496
on this endless road, huh?

241
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:34,127
Although you're strong-willed,

242
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,174
your voice wavered on the phone today

243
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,345
What dreams

244
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:51,310
did you chase to get here?

245
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:56,315
Even I have times

246
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:03,322
when
I just don't understand, baby

247
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,995
When you're sad,

248
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:14,792
I'll be close to you

249
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:20,548
Even on nights when we're apart,

250
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:26,429
I'll be close to you

251
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:32,769
I'll be close to you

252
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,567
Rokusuke and the others
went back to the village,

253
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,277
so I say the mission is complete.

254
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
-Except Lee.
-Oh, oh yeah.

255
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,616
Bushy Brow said he was
going to straighten Karashi's spirit.

256
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,743
I wonder if it's going to be
that easy.

257
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,203
It seems like
there will be some trouble.

258
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,954
Hey, why are you saying that?!

259
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,167
No, not Karashi, but this weather.

260
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,878
Next episode:
"The Dark Creeping Clouds"

261
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,798
I see. There's going to be a storm.
