1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,441
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,445
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,325
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,128
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,881
Now

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,352
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,771
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,498
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,593
What?!

20
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,054
O-Oh!

21
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,516
T-That's...

22
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,726
It's the empty shell of sand!

23
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,778
Lee's Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!

24
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,989
When did that...?! That's not possible!

25
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,117
While you had your eyes closed
and were praying.

26
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,369
What?

27
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,956
For a moment, Lee stopped moving
because of the pain in his body.

28
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,709
At that moment...that's when!

29
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,720
Gaara!

30
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,740
That's...!
There's no doubt about it – his eyes...

31
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,285
He's completely awake...

32
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,581
The demon...inside him.

33
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,188
Run away!

34
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,203
That Bowl-Cut's totally worn down...

35
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,956
Gaara is toying with him.

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,712
W-Why doesn't Lee dodge?

37
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:37,009
With Lee's speed, he should easily be
able to dodge that level of attack.

38
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,347
It's not that he doesn't dodge,
it's that he can't dodge.

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,474
What?! What do you mean?

40
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,686
The Lotus is a double-edged sword.

41
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,438
What do you mean double-edged sword?

42
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,817
Why do you think the Lotus is
a forbidden technique?

43
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,694
Well...

44
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,823
The Lotus isn't a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.

45
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,910
It's a Taijutsu, with that much
high-speed movement.

46
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,122
The load it puts on a person's body
is beyond imagination.

47
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,124
So Lee's entire body is in
so much pain right now

48
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,834
that even moving is out of the question.

49
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,045
Isn't that so...

50
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,463
Guy?

51
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,382
But that's...!

52
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,998
He has no Ninjutsu, not even
one Genjutsu ...

53
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,125
Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,

54
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,710
it's now even less than
an average person's ...

55
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,170
There's no way he can win!

56
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,423
He's had it if this goes on...

57
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,594
Lee...

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,270
Hey, get a move on all of you.

59
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,273
I'll add another 200 laps!

60
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,862
Stupid! There's no way
you'll become a Ninja.

61
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,114
Yes, I will.

62
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,118
There's no way a chump who can't
even use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!

63
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,202
Yes, I will!

64
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,747
Whatever, but the fact that a guy like
you without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,665
and with less Taijutsu than
an average person

66
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,377
is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.

67
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,672
Do you know what you're called here?

68
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,340
Hot-Blooded!

69
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,301
Hot-Blooded!

70
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,219
Hot-Blooded lose-

71
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,889
Hey, get in line, Lee!

72
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,307
Hey Lee!

73
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,896
So that's the hot-blooded loser
everyone's talking about.

74
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,482
Doesn't he look like someone we know?

75
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,816
Huh?

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,319
In particular...his eyebrows.

77
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,737
Hmm...

78
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,530
Rock Lee...

79
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,034
The chump who can only perform
less than average Taijutsu...

80
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,876
But you...

81
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,253
You practiced your less
than average Taijutsu ...

82
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,631
You practiced it over and
over again like crazy...

83
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:26,595
396...397...398...399...

84
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,265
400...401...402...403...

85
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,728
If I can't do a log kick 500 times,
then it's 1,000 squats!

86
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,315
413... 414...

87
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:44,446
415... 416... 417... 418...!

88
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,573
419... 420...

89
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,283
So someone's here before me...

90
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,996
422... 423... 424...

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,999
425... 426...

92
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,709
I suppose I'll come back...

93
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:07,761
If I can't do 1,000 squats,
then it's 2,000 punches!

94
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:14,143
795... 796... 797... 798...

95
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,484
He's still at it...!

96
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,112
2,000 punches!

97
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,990
If I can't, it's 2,000 jump ropes!

98
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,879
You recklessly practiced only
Taijutsu and eventually...

99
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,800
All right, you've all become
Genin as of today,

100
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,470
so I'd like to know what
it is you're all aiming for!

101
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,724
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

102
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,892
Tenten.

103
00:07:54,975 --> 00:08:01,148
I'd like to become a powerful Ninja
like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!

104
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,274
Hmm...

105
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,568
And, how about you, Neji?

106
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,488
I don't want to answer...

107
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,949
I...!

108
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,119
I'd like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja

109
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,748
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

110
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,209
That would be the ultimate for me!

111
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,212
Those are good serious eyes...

112
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,380
Humph!
You!

113
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,925
What's so funny?! I'm serious!

114
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:32,221
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!

115
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,600
He should give up already...

116
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,685
At this rate...

117
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,605
He will simply die with Gaara
just toying with him...

118
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,067
Bushy Brows...!

119
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,570
Lee...

120
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,800
Not yet... Not yet!

121
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:14,429
Lee, you just won't learn
your lesson, will you?

122
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,223
There's no way you can win...

123
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:20,060
Unlike you, Neji is a genius.

124
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,020
A genius...?

125
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,897
What is a genius?!

126
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:28,151
Even though I may not have talent,
I'll exceed genius with my efforts.

127
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,445
That is my entire being!

128
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,156
That is my Way of the Ninja!

129
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,783
You'll get nowhere, Lee...

130
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,869
No matter how much effort you make,

131
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,289
there's no way you can take me down.

132
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,958
That's simply a fact.

133
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,751
That's not true!

134
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,296
That's not...

135
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:03,270
But you...refused to give up, not ever!

136
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,594
Such meaningless actions...

137
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,308
The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to
have Gaara as his opponent!

138
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,726
No...

139
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,229
Lee's not one to give up with this much.

140
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,522
– What?
– Huh?

141
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,524
The reason is that Lee...

142
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,243
The reason is that Lee...

143
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,205
You...continued to make effort.

144
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:09,711
If I can't jump rope 1,200 times,
I'll log kick 2,000 times!

145
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,756
1,116... 1,117...!

146
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,341
1,118... 1,11...!

147
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,385
Huh?!

148
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,818
Lee!

149
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,945
Are you taking a break already?

150
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,455
Guy Sensei...

151
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,249
What is it that you want?

152
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,043
If it's about my blunder with
the recent assignment,

153
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,296
I believe I've apologized.

154
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,884
Lee... It's true you're different from Neji.

155
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,848
You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,
and you're not a Taijutsu genius either...

156
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,268
But Lee...

157
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,478
you have powers that exceed Neji...

158
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,315
you're a genius with hidden potential.

159
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,277
If you're trying to make me feel better,
please stop!

160
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,112
Idiot!

161
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,698
I'm not trying to make you feel better
or anything!

162
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,241
The reason is that you are...

163
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,246
a genius of effort!

164
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,836
I wonder if...

165
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,963
If that's true...?

166
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,927
I've...I've believed that to be true...

167
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,515
That if I trained harder than Neji...
2 or 3 times as much...

168
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,642
that I'd surely become stronger.

169
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,603
But...

170
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,648
I've recently begun to think that...

171
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,277
I can't beat a real genius.

172
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,281
Is effort really rewarded...?

173
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,408
I've wanted to know this and

174
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,911
so I've taken on Neji,
but it's always been the same...!

175
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,748
I'm no match for him at all!

176
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,833
Even when I'm on a mission...

177
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,712
My legs still tremble even now...

178
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:21,259
I think that I'll never become
stronger though I strive and strive...

179
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,679
I am so afraid that I can't bear it!

180
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,435
What am I to do...?

181
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,690
There's no point in making the effort
if you don't believe in yourself!

182
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,491
Lee, you're very similar to me.

183
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,742
Do you mean our eyebrows?

184
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,328
No, not just our eyebrows...

185
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,374
I was actually a failure once too...

186
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,125
You were, Sensei?

187
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:59,548
But now, I can even win against
the genius elite Kakashi,

188
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,841
because of my efforts...

189
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,178
"I'd like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

190
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,848
even though I can't use Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu" you said.

191
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,685
That's your Ninja way, right?

192
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,979
That's a fine goal...

193
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,566
It's a fine goal worth sticking to!

194
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:26,116
That's why you should believe in
your path and forge straight ahead!

195
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,913
Become a man powerful enough
so that I can just watch you smiling!

196
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,374
Understand, Lee?!

197
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,376
Yes!

198
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,520
Thank you...Guy Sensei...!

199
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,447
Stop, Lee!

200
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,741
If you fight any more, you'll die!

201
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,744
Bushy Brows...

202
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,962
What?!
Movement has...

203
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,464
...returned to Lee!

204
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,302
Sensei is smiling and watching me...

205
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,057
And just because of that,
I can come back stronger!

206
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,894
Stronger... stronger still!

207
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,315
Lee's smiling...even though
he's been driven into corner.

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,110
No. It's his turn to do the driving.

209
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,654
Huh?

210
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,324
The Leaf's Lotus blossoms twice.

211
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,910
Blossoms twice...?

212
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,746
Lee said that too!

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,334
The Leaf's Lotus blossoms twice.

214
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:05,757
When we meet the next time,
I vow that I will be an even stronger man.

215
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,051
No, Guy! You haven't?!

216
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,721
It's exactly as you imagine.

217
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,432
So that Genin...

218
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:18,478
that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates
in his body and use the Hidden Lotus...

219
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,438
The Hidden Lotus?

220
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,691
That's right ...

221
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,984
This is incredible...

222
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,155
Guy...

223
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,702
How many of the Eight Inner Gates
can that boy open now...?

224
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,204
Five gates.

225
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,831
What exactly is it?

226
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,334
These Eight Inner Gates and
that Hidden Lotus?

227
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,545
The Eight Inner Gates are
"Limiter Releases"

228
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:48,800
used in preparations for
reaching the Hidden Lotus.

229
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,636
A "Limiter Releases"?

230
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,597
That's right ...

231
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,684
In the Chakra Network where chakra flows,

232
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,729
there are eight places where the
chakra points are concentrated

233
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,064
in each area of the body from the
head area down...

234
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,067
the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,
Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,

235
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:12,365
Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,
Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.

236
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
These are called the Eight Inner Gates.

237
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,871
These eight gates continually "limit"

238
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,333
the amount of Chakra flowing
through the body...

239
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,256
However, the Lotus's essence is to force
the boundaries of these "limits" to open...

240
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,303
and bring out several
tens of times the body's strength.

241
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,765
The Primary Lotus...

242
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,226
opens only the first gate,
the Gate of Opening,

243
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,979
and releases the brains restraints

244
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,982
to bring forth a person's muscles' strength
to its fullest!

245
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,443
That's the kind of technique it is.

246
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,158
So...what is the Hidden Lotus?

247
00:17:55,241 --> 00:18:00,371
After forcing the stamina to increase
at the second gate, the Gate of Rest...

248
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,292
From the third gate, the Gate of Life,
one enters the Hidden Lotus!

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,835
No way!

250
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,756
Even after using just the Primary Lotus,
his body was in shambles.

251
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,050
So if he uses a technique beyond that...

252
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,802
That's right.
Huh?

253
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,888
By opening all the 8 gates,

254
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:22,560
one attains strength exceeding
even the Hokage, but in return...

255
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,104
one dies!

256
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,318
I don't intend to pry into what that
boy means to you

257
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,946
or to tell you not to bring
your personal feelings into play...

258
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,989
But there is a limit!

259
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,116
I've misjudged you...Guy!

260
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,581
What do you know...about that boy?!

261
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,129
There is something important which

262
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,215
that boy wants to prove and
protect even if it costs him his life.

263
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,053
I'd like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

264
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,473
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu and Genjutsu!

265
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,226
That would be the ultimate for me!

266
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,562
That's why I...

267
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,648
wanted to make him a man
that could protect that thing.

268
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,942
That's all there is...

269
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,656
Lee!
I'm going to teach you a new technique.

270
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,740
Yippie, yeah!

271
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,535
– One that will be your trump card.
– Yeah, that's great!

272
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,413
Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!

273
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,875
Lee, listen to my explanation
seriously, all right?!

274
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,879
Y-Yes, Sensei!

275
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,214
Let me first say that...

276
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,217
this is more of a forbidden Jutsu
than the Primary Lotus!

277
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:40,096
And it will become the
most special technique for you.

278
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,057
Special...?

279
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,601
However...

280
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:50,064
there is one strict condition
for using this technique.

281
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,025
That is...

282
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,987
That is...

283
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,702
What?

284
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,164
I don't know what you're planning to do...

285
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,459
dut this is the end for you.

286
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,752
That's true...

287
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,423
In any case...
it will be the end with the next.

288
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,345
Neji...Sasuke...and...

289
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,227
There is no way that I alone
can lose in a place like this!

290
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,650
Guy Sensei...please allow this...!

291
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,944
It is now!

292
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,167
The time to carry through and
protect one's own Way of the Ninja!

293
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,504
The Third Gate of Life...open!

294
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,269
Hey, can you hear it?

295
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,691
The clear, blue sky

296
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,487
goes on and on

297
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,783
The ocean

298
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:28,621
spans limitlessly

299
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,959
Please keep that smile

300
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:37,797
on your face forever

301
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,261
Or else I'll cry

302
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

303
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,269
It's all ok now.

304
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,691
Everyone is inside

305
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,069
this hand

306
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:05,241
When you want to cry,
and you want to run away

307
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,787
When you forget what happiness is

308
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,833
Just sing.

309
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,963
Light is born, and darkness was born

310
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

311
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,056
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

312
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:34,145
Hey, can you hear it?

313
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,152
Effort is always rewarded.
My belief in this has brought me this far.

314
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,114
Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto...

315
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,785
There's no way that I can lose
in a place like this!

316
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,870
Even though this technique is
my ace in the hole,

317
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,789
I'll show it especially to you!

318
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,084
This is my ultimate secret
Taijutsu technique!

319
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,421
Next Episode: "The Fifth Gate:
A Splendid Ninja is Born"

320
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,964
This is the end!
