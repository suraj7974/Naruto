1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,426
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,304
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,809
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,103
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,486
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,496
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,961
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,839
Now

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,948
If you're not the one

17
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:13,908
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,456
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,179
The waves of pain are coming faster...

20
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,266
Sasuke, you should quit
the preliminaries!

21
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,227
Huh?!

22
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,771
L-Look, you haven't been yourself

23
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,690
ever since you got worked over
by that Orochimaru guy!

24
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,151
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha

25
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,779
To think it'd be so soon...?!

26
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,117
I couldn't ask for more.

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,538
For the 1st battle,

28
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,999
Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha
have been selected.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,168
No objections, right?

30
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,671
-Right!
-No!

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,590
The pain won't go away!

32
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,886
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.

33
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,139
Don't use the Sharingan.

34
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,810
So you knew?

35
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,313
If that Curse Mark on
your neck gets out of control,

36
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,857
it could endanger your life.

37
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,235
I believe it.

38
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,030
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.

39
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,492
I'll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.

40
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:40,995
Called off, you say?!

41
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:48,419
It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my Chakra.

42
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,046
In other words, in this match,

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,840
I can hardly use even
my regular Jutsu,

44
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,385
not to mention the Sharingan!

45
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:05,352
However... Yoroi's ability is
the worst for you,

46
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,854
Sasuke.

47
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,065
Now then, please begin.

48
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,918
You... my Chakra...

49
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,880
You just noticed now...?

50
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,058
Bushy-Brow's Jealousy -
Lions Barrage Unleashed!

51
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,668
You... my Chakra...

52
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,631
You just noticed now...?

53
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,476
Yes...Yoroi has unorthodox ability
to absorb Chakra.

54
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,562
It's a magnificent art that
absorbs spiritual and physical energy

55
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:35,025
simply by holding his palm against
an opponent's body.

56
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:41,448
And, if all of your Chakra
is absorbed, Sasuke,

57
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:46,120
you'll be forced to rely upon
the power of my Curse Mark...

58
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:56,797
Now, release that luscious power...!

59
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,093
That is the only way
you have to survive.

60
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,973
You...little!

61
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,649
To think you still have strength left...

62
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,068
Though you're just a guinea pig.

63
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,738
That was a close one...

64
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,658
Put your mind at ease...
I'll end this right away!

65
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,679
What's the matter, what's the matter?!

66
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,972
You already finished?!

67
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,481
His aim is one, close-quarter fight.

68
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,607
What should I do!?

69
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,358
At this rate, things will go downhill...

70
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,949
Sasuke Uchiha...
Is this the best you can do?

71
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,203
Sasuke...

72
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,418
Sasuke!

73
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,880
You call yourself an Uchiha with that?

74
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,967
Don't be looking so lame!

75
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,553
Give your best!

76
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,600
That guy...

77
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,603
That's it!

78
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,313
Oh!

79
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,110
You can't afford to be inattentive!

80
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,530
I'll finish you with this!

81
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,585
Is this as far as it goes...?

82
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,884
He...vanished?!

83
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,103
That's my...!

84
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,604
What?!

85
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,814
Huh?

86
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,948
But then...from here on is my original.

87
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,450
It's over...

88
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,578
The Dancing Leaf Shadow...?!

89
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,623
Eat this!

90
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,261
Dang it...!
It's responding every time...

91
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,783
Please...!

92
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,454
I'm begging you...

93
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,999
Stop!

94
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,634
You! Sasuke!
Don't be looking so lame!

95
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,096
To think they'd be worried about me...

96
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,641
Is this it...?

97
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,272
I won't be swallowed up...
by this thing...

98
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,440
No way!

99
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,036
The Curse Mark receded!?

100
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,581
Here I go!

101
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,963
You're weak!

102
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,675
You're weak.

103
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,729
I'm not done, yet!

104
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,317
Lions Barrage!

105
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,306
There's no need to check.

106
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,912
I'm stopping the match from
going any further...

107
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,126
Therefore, the winner of the
first battle, Sasuke Uchiha...

108
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,128
passes the preliminaries!

109
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,547
Yes!

110
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,230
Well. Good job...

111
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,695
Before that Lions Barrage,

112
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,530
your movements were that
of Guy's Taijutsu...

113
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,576
So you copied it with the Sharingan

114
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,828
when you wrangled that one time
with that Lee kid?

115
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,380
Sasuke! You, you...

116
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,590
won in a lame way!

117
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,259
Look at you, all battered up!
You idiot!

118
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,679
Man, that loser...

119
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,185
Sasuke...Thank goodness.

120
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,938
Okay, I'll win, too!

121
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,612
Lee... Because of you,
I've managed to save my neck.

122
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,823
Things would've gotten hairy

123
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,574
if I hadn't seen your technique
in close-quarters combat.

124
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,213
But it doesn't appear to be a technique
that I can use heavily.

125
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:59,970
I see... So before, he copied a part
of the technique I only used once?

126
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,806
Sharingan!

127
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,396
That's your ability...

128
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,233
Sasuke... you're quite a person.

129
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,902
You get rapidly stronger...

130
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,073
I kind of...feel a bit of fear.

131
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,622
For a sequence of
high-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,

132
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,250
it's impossible to acquire this
without training

133
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,502
that whittles away flesh and blood.

134
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,880
No matter how much you
use the Sharingan,

135
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,592
it can't just be mastered in
a short space of time...

136
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,678
Moreover, his idea for that
finishing move...

137
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:49,519
Kakashi... this boy reminds me
of when you were a kid...

138
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,777
Last year's number one rookie
was Neji Hyuga.

139
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,656
This year's number one rookie
is Sasuke Uchiha.

140
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,910
I wonder which one is stronger...?

141
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,247
Really, he's something else.

142
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,752
To think he'd develop the true power
of the Sharingan in situation like this...

143
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,173
What's most to be feared...
is the Uchiha ability?

144
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,013
That was surprising...

145
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,599
To think he brought the Curse Mark
that was getting out of control

146
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,434
into submission with his will...

147
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,153
Tsk. Again?

148
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,490
It just make it more interesting!

149
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,411
Yeah! He is Sasuke after all...

150
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,497
This is as far as we'll go...

151
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,832
I'm hungry...

152
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,752
W-Wow!

153
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,796
Nothing special.

154
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,010
Magnificent...

155
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,308
Sasuke Uchiha...

156
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,521
We medics will give you
the best of treatment.

157
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,482
You guys are out of your territory.

158
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,441
Huh?!

159
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,652
I'll take him under my care...

160
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,239
Now, I'll take you into the back...

161
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,367
and seal the Curse Mark.

162
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,619
Can we wait until
the preliminaries are over?!

163
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,163
I want to watch the matches
of those who will remain in the main battle.

164
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,540
No!

165
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,209
Don't get so heated.

166
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,335
If we let things be
any further,

167
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,171
the situation might become irrevocable.

168
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,841
I won't accommodate you anymore.

169
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,302
Now then, come on...

170
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,475
Sasuke...

171
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:00,942
Hm?

172
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,595
Sakura... Speaking of which,
during the match...

173
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,765
did you see something that looked
like a strange wound on Sasuke's neck?

174
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,682
What?

175
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,687
Please promise me...

176
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,482
Don't say anything about
this bruise to Naruto.

177
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,483
What?

178
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,445
Listen... this is also teamwork.

179
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,115
It won't do to have him
unnecessarily worried.

180
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,661
I-I don't know either.

181
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,621
I see...

182
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,626
Umm, now then...

183
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,462
We will get right to it and
begin the second match.

184
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,360
Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame

185
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,988
Which weakling is it?!

186
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,291
Both of you, come forward.

187
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,299
We will now begin the second match.

188
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,430
That's the Sound Ninja...

189
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,683
The guy who had both
his arms broken by Sasuke!

190
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,899
It seems like you're proud
of your arms...

191
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:05,817
You!

192
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,653
S-Stop it!

193
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,624
He's going to fight with those arms?

194
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,629
I wonder if Shino is going to be okay...

195
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,299
He's fine. He's strong!

196
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,216
What...?

197
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,345
I'd square off with anybody except him...

198
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,184
Now then, please begin.

199
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,853
Now, Zaku...

200
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,105
How you fight will be a sight to see...

201
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,377
If you fight here,
you'll be finished...

202
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
Withdraw!

203
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,136
Somehow, this one still works, so...

204
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,560
One arm is enough to take care of you!

205
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,567
You can't beat me with
just one arm.

206
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,569
Stop pestering me!

207
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,281
Take this!

208
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,034
Slicing Sound Wave!

209
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,694
Okay.

210
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,906
Hang in there.
It'll be over right away.

211
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,336
Curse Sealing!

212
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,408
Next time, even if that Curse Mark
starts kicking in again...

213
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,829
the power of this Curse Sealing
should suppress it.

214
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:13,087
However, this Sealing Jutsu makes
the strength of your will its foundation.

215
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,257
If something happens like
you not believing in your own strength

216
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,593
and that will were to weaken...

217
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,638
the Curse Mark will
once again start to rage.

218
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,020
Out of character.

219
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,855
It appears he's quite tired...

220
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,776
To think you've become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu...

221
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,906
You've grown, eh, Kakashi...?

222
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,912
You...

223
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,256
Long time no see, Kakashi.

224
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,093
Orochimaru...

225
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,603
Hey, can you hear it?

226
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,147
The clear,

227
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:18,861
blue sky goes on and on

228
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:26,869
The ocean spans limitlessly

229
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:35,962
Please keep that smile on your face forever

230
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:43,594
Or else I'll cry

231
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,473
You won't have to search around you

232
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,060
It's all ok now.

233
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:56,899
Everyone is inside

234
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,278
this hand

235
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:05,408
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

236
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,912
When you forget what happiness is

237
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,916
Just sing.

238
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,130
Light is born, and darkness was born

239
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,424
The two are one

240
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:28,264
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

241
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,311
Hey, can you hear it?

242
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,525
This is surprising.

243
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,652
I never thought you'd appear.

244
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,281
Why are you after Sasuke?
What's your purpose?!

245
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,701
Even though you're one of
the legendary three Ninja,

246
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,203
I must not retreat.

247
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:54,207
I'll stop you here,
even if it costs my life!

248
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,879
Next episode: "Kakashi and Orochimaru:
Face-to-Face!"

249
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,798
Well, it's sink or swim.

250
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,883
<=sign>
