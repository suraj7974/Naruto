1
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,387
So this is the Shukaku?

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,265
It's the first time I've seen
the real thing...

3
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,853
It's dangerous here!
We have to get away!

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,188
But! Gaara Sensei...

5
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,607
Shut up.

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,653
Gaara is trying...to protect you!

7
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:28,738
So hurry!

8
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,573
R-Right.

9
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,244
Hey! Could that be...?!

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,579
Yeah...

11
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,456
The Shukaku transformation
is starting.

12
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,000
Gaara...

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,835
Naruto!

14
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,129
Naruto!

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,173
Hinata, Sakura.

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,925
Matsuri, you okay?

17
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,095
Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei...

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,056
I leave her to you...

19
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,317
Hold it! You are badly hurt!

20
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,279
But...

21
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,324
You'll just become unable
to move right away!

22
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,075
I'll give you some first-aid treatment!

23
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:21,874
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

24
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:28,172
into your hands

25
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:47,316
The distance created between us
became too big,

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,906
because we were always together

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,120
Your honest reply, "See you..."

28
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:06,001
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

29
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:11,924
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

30
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,970
Then I want to deliver you a smile,

31
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,348
even if I'm not by your side

32
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:25,563
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,

33
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:32,111
into your hands

34
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:37,741
I can feel it so close,

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:43,497
Our two hearts

36
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,878
Departure

37
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,423
This is bad... It's a matter of time.

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,841
I knew it.

39
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,636
Sakura! Hurry!
It looks like we don't have much time!

40
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,764
Got it! First, put your hands out.

41
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,349
R-Right...

42
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,486
What's the meaning of this?

43
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,905
What is it, Neji?

44
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,034
That guy wearing the armor is
releasing Chakra stronger than Gaara...

45
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,995
who's half transformed into a beast.

46
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,542
That person called himself Seimei,
the creator of the Village of Artisans.

47
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,587
He said something about being reborn
as the ultimate Ninja tool.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,549
That jerk!
He's taken away Gaara's Chakra!

49
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,803
Come to think of it, the enemy
we fought wore similar armor...

50
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,306
and took away a great deal
of my Chakra.

51
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,391
Armor that sucks up Chakra...

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,810
And that alarming form...

53
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,854
It doesn't look like
we can just carelessly get close.

54
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,815
Now... What do we do?

55
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,654
I didn't figure on fighting
against the Shukaku...

56
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,823
However, this is fun, too.

57
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,868
As great as the Shukaku may be,
this way, I can prove that

58
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,330
it's no match for the ultimate Ninja tool
of the Village of Artisans.

59
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,804
Why is this guy so strong?

60
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,350
I won't allow my important people...

61
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,686
to get hurt!

62
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,649
If not, I will stop you,

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,443
even if that means that
I have to kill you!

64
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,487
Why...?

65
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,491
How is it that you can fight
so much for other people...?

66
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:47,287
They saved me from
the hell of being all alone.

67
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,374
They accepted me for
who I was...

68
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,129
that's why...
they are important to me!

69
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:01,677
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

70
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,972
and to love and watch over that person...

71
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,058
Love...

72
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,187
That is why he is so strong?

73
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:38,881
Gaara!

74
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,967
What's that?
Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?

75
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,428
What happened to him?!

76
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,974
Gaara might be suppressing
Shukaku of his own volition.

77
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:53,270
Why? Wouldn't he end up weakening
his own battle strength?

78
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,900
Even so, he chose to fight
with his own strength and will,

79
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,487
not Shukaku's power,
which he can't control.

80
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,429
So you couldn't maintain
the Shukaku body with that Chakra?

81
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:33,143
I'll...help the friends important
to me with my own power...

82
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,686
How absurd.

83
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,231
A Shinobi doesn't need emotion.

84
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:42,027
It is those who suppress their emotions
who can obtain great power.

85
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:46,532
Great power.
That power is the only justice.

86
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,867
You're finished now.

87
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,457
Eat this!

88
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,761
That's as far as you go,
monster of the Sand Village.

89
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,060
Acting tough, huh...?

90
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:21,066
You shouldn't have
any Chakra left to fight with.

91
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,194
Indeed, I only have a little bit
of Chakra left...

92
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:29,658
But do you think I just sat around
in the cage doing nothing at all?

93
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,909
What?!

94
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,371
Sand Tsunami!

95
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,922
You shouldn't have
any sand you can control!

96
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,258
I'm Gaara of the desert!

97
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,053
It's simple for me to crush rocks
and turn them into sand.

98
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,771
Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!

99
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,278
So you still had
that much power left, huh?

100
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,823
Then I'll just suck up all of that power!

101
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,625
Gaara's Chakra is being sucked out!

102
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,794
– Wha...?!
– Gaara Sensei!

103
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,545
– Damn it!
– Wait! Naruto!

104
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,090
What, Shikamaru? Don't stop me!

105
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,384
You'll just get in the way if you go!

106
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,678
Besides, our Gaara is strong!

107
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,306
Gaara...

108
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,234
Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:

109
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,528
Shukaku's Pike!

110
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,630
Wh-Why...? Why could you...?

111
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,759
Someone who gave up on being human
and was reborn as a Ninja tool

112
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,177
could never understand anyway.

113
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,433
I don't understand. Why?

114
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,060
Why?!

115
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,734
Giant Sand Burial!

116
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,289
He did it!

117
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,207
Gaara Sensei won!

118
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,917
Yeah! Gaara!

119
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,343
– Gaara!
– Gaara!

120
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,724
He's okay...

121
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,392
He's just extremely fatigued

122
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,102
on account of using
his Chakra all at once.

123
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:48,982
Gaara completely suppressed
the Shukaku on his own volition.

124
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,150
Yeah...

125
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,489
I want to work hard

126
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,158
and become an existence acknowledged
by other people...

127
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,078
I thought that looking
at Naruto Uzumaki.

128
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,497
Ties with other people...

129
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,377
For me, until now, that was just hate
and murderous intent.

130
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:13,965
However, there's something
I've understood just a little...

131
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,136
about the ties he goes so far for
and talks about.

132
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,768
Suffering, sorrow and happiness

133
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,271
can be shared with someone.

134
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,112
You've also made someone
you can share with at last...

135
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,447
Did you say something?

136
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,615
No, nothing...

137
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,747
We came to the trouble
of rushing here.

138
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,916
To think it'd be over...

139
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,919
It seems
the inexperienced knuckleheads

140
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,589
have grown a teeny weeny bit...

141
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,008
You are very strict.

142
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,913
Pervy Sage!

143
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,458
Oh, long time no see, Naruto.

144
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,878
Don't give me that "long time no see"
garbage, you jerk Sage!

145
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,629
You were talking all big about
watching my training,

146
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,215
making me into your protégé
and stuff!

147
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,010
Where were you traipsing
around until now?!

148
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,097
Well, how can I put this?
I was gathering information.

149
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,726
It was probably just information
on naked ladies anyway, right?

150
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,311
You idiot!

151
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,397
Even I come through when it counts...

152
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,401
I was mainly after information
on the Akatsuki.

153
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,777
Akatsuki!

154
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,822
With this I've been able
to verify their actions.

155
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,158
And now as promised,

156
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,703
two years later when
they'll move into high gear,

157
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,873
I will thoroughly train you.

158
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,673
I wonder if you're prepared?

159
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,761
I've been tired of waiting!

160
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,524
I owe you one.

161
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,736
No. I just repaid the debt
from last time.

162
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,614
Next time, I'll settle things
more properly.

163
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,326
Well, this time I'll acknowledge
that you didn't cry.

164
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,161
Not again.

165
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,205
Just like a woman...

166
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,332
What about him?
Huh?

167
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,376
Naruto?

168
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,879
I hear he's leaving today on
a training journey with Jiraiya.

169
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,590
Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?

170
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,343
Yeah.
It's such a pain.

171
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,930
He's going to come back
having gotten stronger again.

172
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,307
See you around.

173
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,393
– Farewell...
– See ya.

174
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,900
Please tell Naruto...

175
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,361
Thanks to him,

176
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,614
I figured out what the words
Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.

177
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,536
I'll dedicate myself under
Gaara Sensei from now on...

178
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,212
What did he do?

179
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,852
Well, I guess that's about it.

180
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:20,170
I read the Village of Artisans report
from the other day.

181
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,924
Although it didn't go as far as
a perfect 100,

182
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,426
I'll give you a passing grade.

183
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,219
No! I'm still very much lacking
in experience.

184
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,387
Of course!

185
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,390
I'll have you carry out
several missions

186
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,559
and get you to build up
lots of experience,

187
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,894
so make sure to dedicate yourself!

188
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,814
What?! Does that mean
I'm totally going to get overworked?

189
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,642
Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?

190
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,977
Ino?

191
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,146
Sure. What's up?

192
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,443
As, as it happens,
I was thinking about it the while...

193
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,697
But it became totally clear to me
on this mission!

194
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,908
Clear that I'd be no good at all
at this rate!

195
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,703
Ino.

196
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,747
It's frustrating,
but I was envious of you.

197
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,208
You, who everyone depended on.

198
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,962
So, please.
I also want to become a Medical Ninja.

199
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,881
I know it'll be hard.

200
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,261
But I've got guts and I'll manage
the studying, no matter what.

201
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,222
So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?

202
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,808
– Sure.
– Really?!

203
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,810
But prepare yourself.

204
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,272
Once that happens,
you'll be my little sister protégé.

205
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,023
What's that...?

206
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,400
Naturally!

207
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:11,740
After all, I'll be your
Medical Ninja superior, you know.

208
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,243
Man, I can't wait.

209
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,203
You'll be my lovable little sister protégé.

210
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,664
I'll train you nice and hard.

211
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,209
Just you watch!
I'll pass you up right away!

212
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,837
Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!

213
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,089
I'll do it! Billboard Brow!

214
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,096
Why?! Why is it?!

215
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,389
What are you talking about?!

216
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,518
Why was I the only one left out
of the mission the other day?!

217
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,564
But you were with
a different team then, right?

218
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,900
But everyone had taken part!

219
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,694
She's kind of in a rage.

220
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,822
It's hard being the only one left out
of a mission.

221
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,033
Come to think of it,

222
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,494
it seems Naruto finally leaves
for training.

223
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,956
I heard. It seems that Jiraiya
is going to be his mentor.

224
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,627
Damn it! That guy's going
to get strong again.

225
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,465
It looks like the village will
get quiet for a while.

226
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,302
Viewed in that light,
it's a little bit sad, isn't it?

227
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,764
No! This isn't the time
to be getting sad!

228
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,099
I must work hard!

229
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,976
Several times more,
several times more.

230
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,188
If I don't work hard hundreds
of times more than Naruto,

231
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,316
I won't be able to face him
the next time we meet.

232
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,360
Your guard is off!

233
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,786
We also must grow by that time.

234
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,623
It's because trying to improve
by learning from others,

235
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,292
that is what's called friendship.

236
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,046
Good grief,
we'd better not lose, Akamaru.

237
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,382
Same here!

238
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,217
Hey, you okay, Lee?!

239
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,636
I'm fine, I'm fine.

240
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,943
Lady Hinata, let's call it a day.

241
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,570
What? I'm still...

242
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,615
It's about time for his departure.

243
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,700
Oh!

244
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,618
You won't be able to
see him for a while.

245
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,292
I see... It looks like you'll be
on a long journey...

246
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,376
Yeah!

247
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,884
Listen up.
Be sure to train and don't goof off.

248
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,802
Right! You can count on me!

249
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,183
It's about time to go, Naruto.

250
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,602
Right!

251
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,735
Okay! I'm off, Iruka Sensei!

252
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,321
I'll pay you back for the ramen
once I've become a success.

253
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,031
Jeez...

254
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,208
Good luck, Naruto.

255
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,765
Keep your eyes on me.

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,900
What're you doing?!
I'll leave you behind, Naruto.

257
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,945
Hey. H-Hey, wait up!

258
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,830
I also have to work hard in order
to catch up with Naruto.

259
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,852
The Key to the rusted heart's door

260
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:16,442
Will always be smiling right near by

261
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,411
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

262
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,999
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

263
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,586
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

264
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,508
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

265
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,762
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

266
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:49,934
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

267
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:54,313
Even if I'm told that
there is no bright future

268
00:21:54,397 --> 00:22:01,362
I'll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

269
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:05,992
The wind is probably testing our hearts

270
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:11,164
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

271
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:15,376
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

272
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,131
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

273
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,594
The Key to the rusted heart's door

274
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:30,725
Will always be smiling right near by
