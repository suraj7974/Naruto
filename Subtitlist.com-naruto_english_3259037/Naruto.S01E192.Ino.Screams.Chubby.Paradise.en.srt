1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:03,254
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,715
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:10,928
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,279
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:33,325
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,662
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,582
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:44,587
have also been lost.

9
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:51,260
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,973
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,520
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:06,901
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:12,615
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,496
We're sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,468
I'll give it to you straight...

16
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,388
Your next mission was commissioned
by a certain Feudal Lord's daughter.

17
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,556
You are to act as her double.

18
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,934
I don't know where she heard about you,

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,228
but you apparently bear
a striking resemblance to the princess.

20
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,689
Therefore she requested
that you be the one who carries it out...

21
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,691
A double...?

22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,820
Is someone targeting the princess?

23
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:54,573
Well, if anything,
she's the one who's doing the targeting...

24
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:55,658
Huh?

25
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,410
Not to worry.

26
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,163
You're already an admirable
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

27
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,624
Furthermore, I've arranged for you
to have an assistant.

28
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,459
Assistant?

29
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,547
Grandma Tsunade!
You have a mission for me?

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,215
And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!

31
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,175
Huh?!
Lady Tsunade!

32
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,387
Sorry, but all the other guys
are too busy.

33
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,348
Just me and this guy?

34
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,060
Yup.
Do your best to carry out the mission.

35
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,819
The client is
a Feudal Lord's daughter, huh...

36
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,321
Wow... I guess that means that
I've finally became good enough

37
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,283
to handle amazing missions
like this, huh?!

38
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,285
Hey, don't get too excited.

39
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,912
Terrible things happen
when you're like that.

40
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:46,876
I know...
Just leave things in my capable hands!

41
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,044
You're really a piece of work...

42
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:57,845
Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!

43
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,561
Thank you for coming from afar.

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,063
That's the client?

45
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,774
She and Ino really do look alike, but...

46
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,194
I-It's a bit of a stretch...

47
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:22,620
It's all right.
I have an idea of what you wish to say.

48
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,082
My physique doesn't really resemble
that of the double there...

49
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,751
That's what you're thinking, right?

50
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:32,379
– Oh...not at all... Umm...
– To be honest,

51
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,715
– I don't think you resemble her at all.
– Hey!

52
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,677
Well, I don't blame you for thinking that.
But here, have a look at this!

53
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:43,974
T-That's...Ino!

54
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,144
That's what I looked like
a short time ago...

55
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,773
Truth be told, I only got like this

56
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,067
after it was decided that
I was to have an arranged courtship.

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,151
An arranged courtship?!

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,488
The other party is Master Chikara
from the neighboring Land of Udon.

59
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,199
Ever since I saw his picture,

60
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,703
my feelings for him
have deepened day by day.

61
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,499
And as the day
of the arranged courtship grows closer,

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,043
I have become increasingly nervous,
my cheeks have been flushed,

63
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,836
and my heart has been pounding.

64
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,048
I can't even sleep at night.

65
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:23,389
And because of that stress,
I've started overeating...

66
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,600
It goes without saying that
you'll get fat if you pig out.

67
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:30,104
Of course,
I've taken appropriate countermeasures!

68
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,273
I've been using something that cuts all
the fats and carbohydrates that I ingest...

69
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,401
"Easy-Peasy Slim Special"

70
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,406
It didn't work, did it?

71
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,408
I placed too strong hopes in it...

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,368
How can I possibly have
an arranged courtship

73
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,121
with the man I'm infatuated with
when I look like this?

74
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,290
So that's my situation...
Now, let's get to the main issue.

75
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,461
I want you to attend
the arranged courtship in my place

76
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,672
and make it a success at any cost.

77
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,259
Huh?!
So this double thing

78
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,219
is just to act on you behalf
at some arranged courtship?!

79
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,471
What do you mean by
"some arranged courtship"?!

80
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,516
I mean, when you talk about doubles,
you thinks of situations

81
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,352
where someone's life is in danger
and that sort of thing.

82
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,770
What are you talking about?!

83
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,315
The princess's entire life is at stake!
This is major!

84
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,194
Oh! So you understand a heart in love...

85
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,031
I sure do...
A girl always wants to look cute

86
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,742
for the guy she loves.

87
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,285
Even if she's a fake...?

88
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:31,373
It can't be helped.
I mean, guys prefer slender girls.

89
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,417
That's exactly right!

90
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,918
I'm counting on you.

91
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,713
Sure thing! Leave it to me!

92
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,674
But even if
the arranged courtship goes well...

93
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,176
The gap is just too big.

94
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,014
I'll just have to lose weight
by the day of the wedding.

95
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,683
I already have a plan in place for that.

96
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:53,604
This supplemental type diet food,
"Supplement Slender"!

97
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,731
If I supplement all three meals with this...

98
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,692
Why don't you draw on the lessons
you're supposed to have learned...?

99
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:04,156
In any case, I'll use my charms to make
this arranged courtship a success!

100
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:15,125
This annex is where
I often played in my childhood.

101
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:20,672
I plan to use this to listen in on
the arranged courtship from here.

102
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,009
Huh... That's pretty convenient.

103
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,721
I would love to meet him in person
if I could, but...

104
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:31,225
Hey, is he that cool looking?

105
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,936
Of course he is!

106
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,563
He's someone with
something really special about him!

107
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,150
Well then,
just make sure he falls for you.

108
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,945
Leave it to me!

109
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,032
I thought you weren't motivated...

110
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,409
Well, this is a mission after all.

111
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,121
So I think I'll pull myself together
and hustle!

112
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,665
Don't do anything unnecessary, okay!

113
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,213
W-What's up?

114
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,965
The sound is getting closer!

115
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,136
– What?
– It's so bright!

116
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
There are many a handsome man
in this world,

117
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,601
but this man is
renowned even among them!

118
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,063
This man makes
Land of Udon what it is...

119
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,816
that sexy man
with glistening sidelong glances!

120
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,903
The oh-so-great young prince Chikara...

121
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,780
Kneel down and bow before him!

122
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,203
Sorry.

123
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,747
It appears that
I have kept you waiting, princess

124
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,125
You're...Master Chikara?

125
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,211
He's even more intense than
Intense-Brow Sensei.

126
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,851
I'm sorry, pretty girl.

127
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,021
I have constitutional low blood pressure.

128
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,232
Dunno. He looks more like
he has high blood pressure to me...

129
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,780
What?
D-Do you always scatter flower petals...?

130
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,324
Flowers are wonderful.

131
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,576
They truly allay the fatigue
of your mind and your body.

132
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,244
Don't you find them relaxing?

133
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,705
I-I guess...

134
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,208
Okay then, next...

135
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,798
Hey, don't you think
he's different from her description...?

136
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:27,883
I mean, he's fa...

137
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,134
Fa...?!

138
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,344
Stop!

139
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,056
These sweets are really fabulous,
aren't they?

140
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,433
Do excuse us a little.

141
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,107
What the heck are you doing,
out of the blue like that?!

142
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,776
It's women's intuition.

143
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,861
I got the same vibe from him as Choji.

144
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,489
That word is probably taboo.

145
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,615
Oh, I see!

146
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,533
Gimme a break!

147
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:57,162
What's up with that uselessly
intense chubby guy showing up

148
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,164
when she told us
he'd be a handsome prince?!

149
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,625
But wouldn't his physique
be a perfect match for her?

150
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,086
I'm sure there must be some mistake.

151
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,672
There's no way a girl
would fall in love with a guy like that.

152
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,091
But maybe that's
the princess' taste in men...

153
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,843
That's impossible. I mean...

154
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,763
He's flashy...!
Intense...! And a fatso!

155
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,723
He's a freak! A freak!

156
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,184
There's gotta be a mistake!
I'm sure of it!

157
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,061
Y-You think so?

158
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,148
What are you saying?

159
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:31,405
There's no mistake that that's
Master Chikara, the man of my heart.

160
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,198
I thought so...

161
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,492
What an elegant man...

162
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,371
I deeply regret that I cannot see him
up close with my very own eyes.

163
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,832
I guess one could say that everybody
has their own set of woes.

164
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,918
Listen, make sure that
he takes a liking to me no matter what!

165
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,796
Stop complaining and get the ball rolling
with dogged persistence!

166
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,507
I will convey that to her.

167
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:01,310
Has you tension not eased?
Music is good for relaxation.

168
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,731
Please, you need not go to the trouble...

169
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,026
– What did she say?
– She said there's no mistake.

170
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,653
She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!

171
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,488
I can't believe it!

172
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,407
It's our mission, you know!

173
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,784
I know that...

174
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,080
Princess Fuku...do you like roses?

175
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,541
Yes...very much so...

176
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,378
Great!
I love roses too!

177
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,547
In the language of flowers,
they signify love!

178
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,136
But don't their meanings
differ depending on their color?

179
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,972
For example, yellow roses are
supposed to mean "Let's break up"...

180
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,726
It's nonsense to discriminate
because of color...

181
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,939
I mean the flowers
are not at fault, after all.

182
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,211
For you.

183
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,180
Hey...wait!

184
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,474
Huh?

185
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,311
I can't do it! I can't do it!

186
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,397
There's no way!
He's too intense.

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,859
There's no way I can act as
a substitute for the princess!

188
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,446
Calm down.
Stop saying that and do your best.

189
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,448
Nope.
I just can't stand him physically.

190
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,076
Oh, I got it.
If you just think of him

191
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,578
– as a somewhat intense Choji...
– Choji has fat on him

192
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,996
for the sake of his Ninjutsu...

193
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,041
I don't have the slightest idea
what purpose that prince's fat serves.

194
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,294
That's a pretty severe opinion,
you know...

195
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,171
I'm going off somewhere for a moment.

196
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,091
Huh? Hey, where are you going?!

197
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,927
Gimme a break, that girl's a handful...

198
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,681
Well, this is for the sake of
a mission after all.

199
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:07,102
I guess it's about time for Naruto
to lend a helping hand!

200
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,315
What is it?!

201
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,778
I'm not judging you, but I think you
should pass on that young prince.

202
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:20,365
There's something wrong with his head.
I'm positive!

203
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,203
What are you saying?
He's a passionate and wonderful man!

204
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,329
But...

205
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,249
I hired the Leaf to
provide me with substitute for

206
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,918
the arranged courtship
and bring it to success.

207
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,087
You're a professional Shinobi, right?

208
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,715
So I suggest you get on it
and get the job done!

209
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,386
The atmosphere in there
hasn't been very congenial at all!

210
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,598
You need to be aggressive
in making yourself appealing to him!

211
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,476
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting, Chikara!

212
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,936
That's right!
Just like that...huh?

213
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,062
That jerk...!

214
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,147
H-Hey!

215
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,027
P-P-Princess?

216
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:05,577
Master Chikara... Could you loosen
my sash for me, please?

217
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,621
But...but...

218
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,166
Please.

219
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,584
Oh my gosh!

220
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,129
There's a creepy-crawler up here
under the roof that looks like a sow bug!

221
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,091
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

222
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,012
A creepy-crawler
that looks like a sow bug?

223
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,347
An insect?

224
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,806
Oh...she vanished...

225
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,768
What the heck are you thinking?!

226
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,729
Where is the princess?
I don't know.

227
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,356
She vanished...

228
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,233
What is going on anyway?

229
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,196
This is starting to irritate me...
I can't get what's happening from here.

230
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,158
Why are you meddling!
I was just one step away!

231
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,246
What do you think you're doing,
dressed up like Princess Fuku?!

232
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,497
I'm telling you!

233
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,374
In one of Pervy Sage's books
happened to glance at,

234
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,584
this is the kind of thing that worked.

235
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,088
I don't believe that anyone would
use such a garish advance!

236
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,840
That's dirty!

237
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,551
There's absolutely no way
a type of guy like you

238
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,761
would ever be mistaken for
the protagonist of a boy's comic!

239
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,974
Huh! I was doing a way better job
than you were!

240
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,645
Gimme a break...

241
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,896
Now that things have come to this,

242
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,441
I need to take care of business
before another meddler gets in the way!

243
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,946
Huh... You gotta be kidding...

244
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,576
It looks like my help is needed
if this mission is going to be a success.

245
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,330
Princess...
where in the world have you been?

246
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,712
Please forgive me. I was so nervous
I just flew into a panic earlier on...

247
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,673
You really seemed like
a totally different person.

248
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,717
I'm so sorry.

249
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,139
You were such a wonderful person,
that it became almost unbearable...

250
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,183
Non. That is bad.

251
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,352
We must change
the air in here then.

252
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,813
Oh, in that case, I will...

253
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,026
Hi... Chikara!

254
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,161
That just now,
outside the sliding paper door...

255
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,871
What's the matter?

256
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,833
There was one more...princess!

257
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,629
That can't be... Impossible.

258
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,340
INNER INO
Naruto...!

259
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,302
But I'm very moved that
you have such deep feelings for me

260
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,720
that you actually saw a vision...

261
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,806
Vision? No, I definitely saw...

262
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,308
You mustn't look!

263
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,815
P-Princess?

264
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,193
Damn...I did that without thinking...

265
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,944
Oh goodness me...

266
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,199
In my ardent desire for
you to look just at me, I...

267
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,160
What intense passion...

268
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,622
All right...
As you wish, princess.

269
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,750
– Huh?
– Allow me to catch

270
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,752
those hot feelings in fine style!

271
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,379
Could this be...?

272
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,382
Come, don't hold back.

273
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,342
Huh?!

274
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,976
You may not kiss him!
No kisses!

275
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,061
Oh!

276
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,357
Goodness, you cannot
be too careful these days!

277
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,235
Who told you that you could
go as far as kissing him?!

278
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,445
Oh, it's not that I wanted to...

279
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,781
I'd have to say that
you actually came to my rescue.

280
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,408
Don't bandy words with me!

281
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,370
Listen carefully, holding hands is
as much as I can concede to you...!

282
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,913
You're too loud!

283
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,124
The princess vanished again.

284
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,458
Princess!

285
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,378
This isn't good!
I better hurry back.

286
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,755
Don't try anything funny in there!

287
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,262
I know that! In any case, we can't let him
see the two of us together!

288
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,097
Hurry back to your room, Princess!

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,432
All right.

290
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,731
Gimme a break that Ino...

291
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:07,652
Dumping me in the lake like that.
Thanks to her I'm freezing!

292
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,366
This is bad! I gotta pee...
Gotta go!

293
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,535
I don't know where
the toilet is around here.

294
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,289
There's nobody around...
Well, it is an emergency situation after all.

295
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,335
Huh?!

296
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,965
W-W-What the heck do you think
you're doing over there looking like me?!

297
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,633
No...this is...um...

298
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,052
How shameless!
Stop that immediately!

299
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,304
I can't stop it...

300
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,055
Do you not understand that
I'm telling you to stop!

301
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,808
It's impossible to stop so sudden!

302
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,653
Wait up!

303
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,745
I wasn't quite
emotionally prepared earlier on...

304
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,415
However, the feelings I have
for you in my heart are true.

305
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,918
Princess...
Master Chikara...

306
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,878
I have harbored a secret love for you
for a long time.

307
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,341
Please, take me...

308
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,093
Huh?

309
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,932
– I wonder what that sound is?
– I have no idea...

310
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,061
Rain?

311
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,234
What a beautiful rainbow...

312
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,028
Stop, I say!

313
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,696
I told you, it's impossible!

314
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,955
Ouch!

315
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,331
Princess?!

316
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,794
Naruto!

317
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,171
You idiot!

318
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,840
Forgive me for this one, please!

319
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,299
I won't forgive you!

320
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,719
Look what you've done!

321
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,804
Ouch... Stop!

322
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,389
What in the world is going on?!

323
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,851
Oh no!...
Umm...this is, well...

324
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:07,564
All right, that's enough...
We can't fake it any longer.

325
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:14,529
I apologize for having hoodwinked you.
I am...the bona fide Fuku.

326
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,907
You mean to say that
the princess up to now was an imposter?

327
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,951
That is correct.

328
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,413
What is the meaning of all this?

329
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,625
I wouldn't have imagined that
things would come to such a finale!

330
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,086
No, that's not correct, Master Chikara!

331
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
Out of my way!

332
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:38,011
The super body I fantasized about
in my dreams! My ideal personified!

333
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,262
Bravo!

334
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,555
Huh?

335
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,151
My cute princess. Please marry me!

336
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,653
I'm delighted, Master Chikara!

337
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:59,657
Hail the future wife!

338
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,828
What is this anyway...?

339
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,999
Somehow it seems like our mission
turned out to be success in the end...

340
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,208
I think?

341
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,213
Could it be? I put all my efforts
in making advances on a guy

342
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,883
who's not my type in the least
and got rejected.

343
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,970
Moreover,
it was a totally wasted effort...

344
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,472
Is that what happened?

345
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,646
But, everything turned out well.
So isn't it okay?

346
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,689
And both of them look so happy together...

347
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:36,611
That's not the problem!
A damsel's heart has been wounded...

348
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,239
I can't believe that, of all things,
I was brushed off by a guy like that...

349
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,159
He didn't even glance in your direction
at the end there.

350
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,662
Stop it! Don't remind me.

351
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,123
You can never knows
what a person likes, can you?

352
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,834
Nope...
there's no way I'll acknowledge that!

353
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,964
A man's got to like a slender girl better!

354
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,257
In order to become
even more of a woman,

355
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,051
I'm going on a diet! On a diet!

356
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,679
Wait...wait up!

357
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,819
Naruto, let's make some
bittersweet memories of youth together!

358
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,863
Huh?
No need to be shy.

359
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,783
I am ready both in mind and body!

360
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,284
What are you blabbing about
all of a sudden?!

361
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,662
It was long... To think how much
I've waited for this moment!

362
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,915
I have no idea what you're talking about!

363
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,919
Here I come Naruto!
Please become my first.

364
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,129
Just a minute."

365
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,549
Next Time: "Viva Dojo Challenge!
Youth is all about Passion!"
