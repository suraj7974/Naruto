1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,437
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,356
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,736
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,948
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:35,870
For no single one,

7
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,540
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:45,004
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,300
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,051
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,220
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,766
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,768
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,687
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,862
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,328
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,709
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,213
Rockin' my heart

20
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,292
Today's...a special day, so...

21
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,712
Time to eat!

22
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,224
Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?

23
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,093
Fight me, here!

24
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,141
What're you doing, Konohamaru?

25
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,852
Very good, Naruto...

26
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,938
You're the man I expected you to be.

27
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,568
I didn't do anything, you know...

28
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,446
Let's fight fair!

29
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,407
Sorry! I've got
an orientation meeting to go to.

30
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,826
An orientation meeting...?

31
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,662
Cause... As of today, I'm a Ninja!

32
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,332
Oh...

33
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,768
Sakura!
Shouldn't you be heading out soon?

34
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,771
I was thinking of leaving now!

35
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:54,234
Cha! How long are you planning
to treat me like a child?!

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,825
That's right... I'm not a student
of the academy anymore...

37
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,913
I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village,
Sakura Haruno!

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,748
I'm off!

39
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,548
Morning, Sakura.

40
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,550
Morning... Ino.

41
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,520
Who would've thought you'd
be able to graduate.

42
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,897
Ancient history has nothing to do with it.

43
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,775
As of today,
we're both full-fledged Ninjas...

44
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,111
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!

45
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,885
What the...? Why are you here?

46
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,722
Today's meeting is for graduates only.

47
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,435
Hey, don't you see this headband?

48
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,938
As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!

49
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,902
How can I put it, it really suits me.

50
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,824
So Naruto...was able to graduate.

51
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,917
Goal!

52
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,964
I won again, Sakura!

53
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,257
What're you saying...?

54
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,136
The tip of my foot got in
one centimeter faster!

55
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,597
You must be blind.

56
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,349
It's Sakura.

57
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,563
Oh...

58
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,525
Sakura's looking at me...

59
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,737
Hey, Sakura!

60
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,697
Mor...morning, Sakur...

61
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,115
Get outta' the way!

62
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,285
M-Morning, Sasuke...

63
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,041
Mind if I sit next to you?

64
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,419
Hey! I'm going to sit
next to Sasuke!

65
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,296
First come, first served!

66
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,257
I got in the classroom sooner!

67
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,301
-I did!
-If that's the case, then I did!

68
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,844
I was first!

69
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,721
I'm sitting next to Sasuke!

70
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,475
How annoying...

71
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:37,731
Is that this year's top rookie,
Sasuke Uchiha?

72
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,691
Yes.

73
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,654
The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?

74
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,489
Yes.

75
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,293
Naruto Uzumaki, eh...

76
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,184
Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!

77
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,062
Sakura...

78
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,524
Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.

79
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,818
What's so great about this guy?!

80
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,199
Just beat him up, Sasuke!

81
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,409
Yeah! Yeah!

82
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,119
What? Really?

83
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,079
Oh! Sorry!

84
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,455
Wha...?

85
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,540
Whoa!

86
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:50,721
Cha! I was planning on
seizing Sasuke's first kiss!

87
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,268
You jerk...
Naruto! I'll kill you!

88
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,187
– My mouth is rotting.
– Huh? Was that my fault?

89
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,398
What? I feel rage...

90
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,443
Naruto...

91
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,361
You...

92
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,864
An accident...
It was an accident

93
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,075
You are annoying!

94
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,285
Yikes!

95
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,124
Naruto...He's at
the center of trouble as usual.

96
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,005
As of today, you all have become
full-fledged Ninjas...

97
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,799
However, you're still Genin.

98
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,552
The tough part's still to come!

99
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,556
From here on, you'll be in a squad of three

100
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,101
and carry out your missions
under your Jonin teachers.

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,980
A squad of three?!

102
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,859
I wonder who's going to be
grouped with Sasuke.

103
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,861
I don't know...

104
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:53,784
Cha! I'll be the one grouped
with Sasuke, naturally!

105
00:08:55,452 --> 00:09:00,540
Squads of three, eh.
It'll just slow me down...

106
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,417
First will be Sakura.

107
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,086
And the other person...

108
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,297
can be anyone other than Sasuke!

109
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,466
The groups have been determined

110
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,261
so that the strength of
the groups will be balanced.

111
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,972
Now for the assignments!

112
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,768
Now then, next is Group Seven...

113
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,812
Naruto Uzumaki!

114
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,273
Sakura Haruno.

115
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,234
Hooray!

116
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,111
I'm with...Naruto...?

117
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,238
And...Sasuke Uchiha!

118
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,156
Hooray!

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm with...Sasuke...?

120
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,873
So I'll be in a different group
from Naruto, huh...

121
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,960
Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!

122
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,129
Y-Yes...

123
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,922
Kiba Inuzuka!

124
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,425
Shino Aburame!

125
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,514
Why is this happening...?

126
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,890
Group Nine.

127
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,310
Cha! Love will be victorious!

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,895
Man...

129
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:08,108
Why do women think that
kind of guy's so great...?

130
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,194
Don't you understand, Shikamaru?

131
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,156
Well, I'm not a woman...

132
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,702
That's why you are
not popular among girls.

133
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,164
I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.

134
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,586
Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.
Shikamaru Nara.

135
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,089
It appears we've been
grouped together.

136
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,802
And Choji Akimichi.

137
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,224
And Fatty on top of that...

138
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,020
That's all for the group division.

139
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,563
Iruka Sensei!

140
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,565
Why does an exceptional student
like me have to be

141
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,609
in the same group with this guy?!

142
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,781
Sasuke has the best grades
of the graduates.

143
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,325
Naruto, you're at the bottom!

144
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,789
Of course, this is how it is when trying
to balance the strength within groups.

145
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,751
Just don't get in my way, loser!

146
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,545
Hey, what did you say?!

147
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,130
You want to fight, loser?

148
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,508
Knock it off, Naruto!!

149
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,137
In the afternoon,
I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.

150
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,722
You're dismissed until then!

151
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,392
Sasuke!

152
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,478
Where'd you go, Sasuke?

153
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,900
I thought since we're in the same group
and all, we'd eat together.

154
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,902
Sakuraaaa!

155
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,864
Since we're in the same group and all,
let's eat together!

156
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,785
Why should I have to eat with you?!

157
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,704
Well...we're in the same group, so...

158
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,165
You're...annoying.

159
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,129
Sasuke! Where are you?

160
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,805
Darn! This is no fun.

161
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,642
I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura...
and then it's like this...

162
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,687
I wonder if something good will happen...

163
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,864
That's it!

164
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,624
Listen up!

165
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,795
As long as we're in the same group,
you will follow my instructions.

166
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,380
Yeah-yeah...

167
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,885
She becomes a real pain in the neck
when people try to argue with to her, so...

168
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,637
Let's all go out for
some BBQ sometime.

169
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,889
Oh, man...

170
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,932
Hmm?

171
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,521
-Naruto...?
-Huh?

172
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh!

173
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,195
Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!

174
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,863
Darn! Just be quiet.

175
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,326
Naruto! I won't forgive you
if you hurt Sasuke!

176
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,960
What happened?

177
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,341
Heh! Idiot...

178
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,433
So Naruto got beaten by
the one he challenged...

179
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,396
Of course! Naruto's no match
for Sasuke!

180
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,569
No need for me to feel rushed...

181
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,112
From here on out,

182
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,781
I'll be in the same group as
Sasuke for the long haul...

183
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
But...

184
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,040
Even if I were to use
my feminine charms...

185
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,167
my proportions are below average...

186
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,295
All that's above average is
the width of my forehead...

187
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,297
What should I do...?

188
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,844
Huh? No way!

189
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,346
Sasuke...is looking...

190
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,514
this way!

191
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,936
And with such a passionate look!

192
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,899
You...have a charmingly wide forehead.

193
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,986
It makes me want to kiss it.

194
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,364
That's what its surface area is for.

195
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,950
Yeah, right...

196
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,328
I'm not just some kid
who believes in fairy tales...

197
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,414
There's no way.

198
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,251
You...have a charmingly wide forehead.

199
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,377
What?!

200
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,006
It makes me want to kiss it.

201
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,683
Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!

202
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:56,479
Or that's what Naruto would say.

203
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,899
I've got something to ask you.

204
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,610
What?

205
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,988
What do you think...of Naruto?

206
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:14,122
He's quite at home interfering and
enjoys it when I make mistakes.

207
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,835
Naruto doesn't understand
one thing about me...

208
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,005
He just annoys me!

209
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,761
All I want...is for you to
accept me, Sasuke...

210
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,889
For me to accept you...?

211
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,478
I'll do anything for the sake of that.

212
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,782
I was careless!

213
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,041
W-Wha...?!

214
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,336
Gotcha!

215
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,634
I didn't think someone who couldn't
perform the Clone Jutsu properly

216
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,554
could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

217
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,977
I'm...desperate, so...

218
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,898
I finally know why I...

219
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,569
I like Sakura so much.

220
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,409
Diarrhea at a time like this?!

221
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,870
What's wrong?

222
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,373
I-I'll be right back...

223
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,377
Sasuke's so shy!

224
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,755
I guess he needs to
prepare himself mentally...

225
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,888
That was close!

226
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,225
My stomach hurt so much that
the Jutsu was about to wear off!

227
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,730
Why does my stomach have
to hurt at such a good time?!

228
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,275
I'm annoying...huh...

229
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,694
She said so again...

230
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,740
And I transformed into Sasuke and
had got a little closer to Sakura...

231
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,953
In that case...
I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke ...

232
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,873
and make her hate him!

233
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:30,258
Oh Sasuke,
you're such a shy bad boy!

234
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:35,263
Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!

235
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,224
H-Hey, Sasuke!

236
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,269
Where's Naruto?

237
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,481
Oh, there you go changing
the subject again...

238
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,442
Just leave Naruto alone!

239
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,111
All he does is pick fights with you!

240
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:54,115
It's because he wasn't raised right!

241
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,241
You know!

242
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,076
He doesn't have any parents, right?

243
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,914
He always selfishly does
whatever he wants!

244
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,501
My parents would get mad at me
if I did something like that!

245
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:09,589
There are no parents to nag you
if it's just you alone!

246
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,675
So his selfishness comes
out at various times!

247
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,636
The loneliness.

248
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,720
Huh?

249
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,225
It's something worse than getting
scolded by parents and...

250
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,186
W-What's gotten into you...?

251
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,564
You... annoy me.

252
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,287
Darn! It finally stopped!

253
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,666
I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.

254
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,924
W-What are you doing here?!

255
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,803
I used the Escape Jutsu,
the very basic of techniques.

256
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,887
Oh...

257
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,389
What were you planning to do...

258
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,598
by transforming into me?!

259
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,852
I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!

260
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,233
The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!

261
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,485
I'll show you that I'm really amazing!

262
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,945
I'll defeat you...

263
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,155
and make you accept me!

264
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,116
Prepare yourself, Sasuke!

265
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Just like that, my stomach again...

266
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,001
B-Bathroom!

267
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,880
-I'm first, I say!
-I'm first, I say.

268
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,298
I'm about to go in my pants, I say!

269
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,261
How stupid!

270
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,765
"You annoy me"...huh?

271
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:48,313
I see. So this is how
Naruto must've felt...

272
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:54,360
I wonder if I can...
be a bit more nice next time...

273
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,404
Darn.

274
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,282
Did I eat something bad?

275
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,742
Naruto...

276
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,245
Smile...Smile...

277
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,916
Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.

278
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,876
Sakura...

279
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,213
Payback for earlier, huh?

280
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,633
Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura...

281
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,677
You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!

282
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,803
I don't think so!

283
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:28,227
Ow-ow-ow...
What the heck is going on?!

284
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,355
Oh...

285
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,235
You idiot, Naruto!

286
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,660
So, this is Naruto's room...

287
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:48,539
And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is
also in the group you'll be in charge of.

288
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,083
I wish you good luck!

289
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,005
The expiration date...

290
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,092
of this milk has passed quite awhile ago...

291
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,097
He'll get sick if he drink this.

292
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,809
It seems like that things are
going to get disastrous.

293
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,319
What the heck is going on?!

294
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,999
What is going on?!

295
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,002
This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei
from yesterday.

296
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,921
Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei

297
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,757
who got caught in my trap
and breezily came late?

298
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,258
Darn it! Darn it!

299
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,636
No way am I giving up!

300
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,681
I'll defeat him and clear
this super difficult testl!

301
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,684
No way am I going back now!

302
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,604
Next episode:
"Pass or Fail: Survival Test"

303
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,689
Don't miss my outstanding performance!
