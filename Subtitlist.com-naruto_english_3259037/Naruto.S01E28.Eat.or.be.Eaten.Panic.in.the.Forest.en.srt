1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,399
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,903
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,709
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,295
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,089
Now

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,908
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:20,664
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

18
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:37,807
We now start the second test
of the Chunin Exam!

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,229
Look for the brats!

20
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,022
Those three, right?

21
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,902
All right! Let's go!

22
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,248
Okay! First we search for that thing.

23
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,625
Can you do it, Hinata?
Yes.

24
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,839
Slow down, Lee! We just started.

25
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,550
I know. But...

26
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,719
I can't stay still!

27
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,055
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us?!

28
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,934
As you already understand,
we have only one target!

29
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,318
It sounds like they've already started.

30
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,406
Huh? That was someone's
scream just now, right?

31
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,329
I-I'm kinda getting nervous.

32
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,709
I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!

33
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,881
I-I have to pee.

34
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,383
Y-You... Fool!

35
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,094
What are you doing in front of a lady!

36
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,971
Go to the grass!

37
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,895
Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest

38
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:14,820
Oh...! Ohhh...!

39
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,575
Aaah... that was a lot!

40
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,035
Feels much better!

41
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:26,081
C'mon Naruto! I told you not to say
things like that in front of a lady...!

42
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,502
What?!

43
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,466
S-Sasuke...

44
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,344
no matter what,
you don't have to go that far.

45
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,556
W-What was that for?

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,808
Where's the real Naruto?!

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,893
Huh?

48
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,189
I don't know what the heck
you're talking about!

49
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,360
What happened to the scratch
you got earlier from the Proctor?!

50
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,948
And...your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.

51
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,783
That guy's right-handed.

52
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,957
You're worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,043
Unlucky me! In that case...

54
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,964
Which one of you got the scroll?!

55
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,924
Since things have come to this,
I'll resort to force!

56
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,054
Fire Style:
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

57
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,479
Heeeey! Sasuke!

58
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,189
You've got to be kidding, loser.

59
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,276
All right!
I caught you off guard! Lucky!

60
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,822
Paper Bomb...!

61
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,038
This is lucky!

62
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,667
I'll kill you if you move!
Calmly hand over the scroll!

63
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,794
Sasuke!

64
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,885
I won't let you get away!

65
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,347
Y-You're always late Naruto!

66
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,768
Absorption with my Chakra.

67
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,367
Sasuke...

68
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,453
Don't just stand there, Sakura!

69
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,621
No guarantee this guy's alone!

70
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,123
Got it?!

71
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,083
If you let your guard down
you'll really get killed...

72
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,797
It's unlucky! I came on my own
to conceal my presence,

73
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,883
but that became my enemy...

74
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,223
He got away, huh...?

75
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,316
If there's an instance that
we become separated,

76
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,902
don't trust him if he looks
like your teammate.

77
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,071
Just like now there's a possibility

78
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,740
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!

79
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,576
– Yeah.
– So what do we do?

80
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,287
We'll decide on a password.

81
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,706
Password?

82
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,629
Listen, if the password is incorrect,
no matter what he looks like...

83
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,756
presume he is an enemy!

84
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,177
I'll only say it once, so listen closely.

85
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,347
You ask,
Ninja song, "Ninja Chance."

86
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,349
And the answer is this:

87
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,019
"The chance to sneak up when a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

88
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,064
"The quiet place has no secret hideout.

89
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,192
"It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

90
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,779
"The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard."

91
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,863
That's it.

92
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,448
Okay!

93
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,453
Could you say it again?
Huh?!

94
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,956
I told you I'd only say it once.

95
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,042
Could it be that you couldn't memorize it?

96
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,002
– You fool!
– Huh?!

97
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,671
I got it right away!

98
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,133
I-I memorized it perfectly!

99
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,762
I thought just in case,
I'd listen one more time...

100
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,140
I'll carry the scroll!

101
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,225
Hey, wait Sasuke.

102
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,601
Ouch!

103
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,314
What is it?

104
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,491
A new enemy?!

105
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,920
You guys go play around ...

106
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,257
I'll go alone...

107
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,104
Sakura!

108
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,189
Sasuke!

109
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,607
Don't come closer!

110
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,317
First the password...

111
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,194
Ninja song, "Ninja Chance"!

112
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,737
Ah! Umm...

113
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,115
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

114
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,701
The quiet place has no secret hideout.

115
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,996
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

116
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,165
The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard.

117
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,958
Good.

118
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,585
Owwww!

119
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,087
Hey everyone, are you okay?

120
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,090
Naruto, wait!
The password...

121
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,551
I know...

122
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,429
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

123
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,098
The quiet place has no
secret hideout.

124
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,602
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

125
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,063
The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard.

126
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,485
– What?!
– Huh?!

127
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,112
What are you doing?!

128
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,824
This time it's someone who
can dodge my attack, huh?

129
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,619
What are you saying, Sasuke?

130
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,205
Naruto just said
the password properly.

131
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,249
He was able to say it,
that's the problem!

132
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,833
– Huh?!
– Wha...?

133
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:07,089
Do you really think that guy can
remember a password that long?

134
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,173
Oh!

135
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,718
If we asked the normal Naruto
what the password is,

136
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,097
what do you think he'd say?

137
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,267
"Sorry. I've forgotten it."

138
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,854
Besides, his movements when
he avoided my attack...

139
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,649
It was clearly different
from Naruto's!

140
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,529
Show your true self already,
fake one!

141
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,412
That's how it is, huh...

142
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,838
But if you knew he would forget it,

143
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,552
why didn't you make
the password shorter?

144
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,971
I knew that you were
underground

145
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:00,475
eavesdropping on
our conversation.

146
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,812
So I chose that password on purpose.

147
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:11,069
Oh really. So you're not tired
or letting your guard down.

148
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,865
This will be more fun than I thought.

149
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,996
This person's...too creepy!

150
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,832
And where's Naruto?

151
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,006
Huh?

152
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,799
Owww!

153
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,054
And heave!

154
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,433
Huh? Where are Sakura
and that Sasuke?

155
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,981
H-Huge!

156
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,861
This is the first time I've seen...
a snake this huge!

157
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,830
Behind?!

158
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,834
T-Tail!

159
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,562
You want our Earth Scroll,
don't you?

160
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,233
'Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.

161
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,375
Well, let's begin...

162
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,921
the battle for the Scrolls.

163
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,843
Life or Death!

164
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,621
Genjutsu?!

165
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,799
No, that's not it.

166
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,262
This is simply
a thirst for blood.

167
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,055
What's going on?

168
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,977
Just looking at her eyes
made me think of death.

169
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,692
Who is this...woman?!

170
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,156
Sa...kura...?

171
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,625
It's no good.

172
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,668
We have no choice but to flee here.

173
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,048
Unless we do, the only thing
waiting for us is...

174
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,385
Death!

175
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,516
Let me out! Hey!

176
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,729
Spit...me...out!

177
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,691
Darn!
It's not going to work.

178
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,861
Something else...

179
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:40,946
Oh!

180
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,325
The rice ball I took for lunch!

181
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,410
Huh?!

182
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,003
It's dissolving!

183
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,715
I'll be digested just like
that rice ball eventually...

184
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,637
N-No!

185
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,349
Let me out! Let me...out!

186
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,525
Can't move already...?

187
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,903
She's going to kill me!

188
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,156
Move...move...move...!

189
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,366
Move!

190
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,954
Move! Move!

191
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,415
Move!

192
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,762
Even if it's just a little...
Move!

193
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,726
What do you intend to do...with that?

194
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,940
I can't move!

195
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:05,238
Don't worry.
I'll end this in a second.

196
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,700
You won't even have
the time to feel pain.

197
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,634
I wanted you to entertain me more.

198
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,178
It's too bad.

199
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,238
Am... I going to die here?

200
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,202
Iruka Sensei

201
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,457
Old Man Hokage...

202
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,920
Konohamaru...

203
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,217
Kakashi Sensei.

204
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,763
Sakura.

205
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,601
Sasuke.

206
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,357
A lot happened between him and me.

207
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,277
Even though we always squabbled,

208
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:31,574
we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei
in that encounter with Zabuza.

209
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,745
During our Chakra training in forest,

210
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:40,667
we competed each other and
practiced climbing up trees.

211
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,090
That's it! I haven't...

212
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,093
settled things with him yet!

213
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,471
– More rice!
– More rice!

214
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,938
If this creature doesn't want to
spit me out ...

215
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,483
I'll make it to do so at any cost!

216
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,666
I see.

217
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,647
Sasuke!

218
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,695
He wounded himself
at the last moment...

219
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,703
Move. Move. Move.
Move...!

220
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,336
Move!

221
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,557
He wiped out the fear with pain.

222
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,438
As expected,
he's not the average prey.

223
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,275
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

224
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,539
I...am a Shinobi who
will become Hokage!

225
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,334
I won't put up with being
snake dung in this place!

226
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,720
Sasuke.

227
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,264
Are you okay?

228
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:05,144
If we don't flee in a hurry,
we'll be discovered here, too.

229
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,313
How do we flee...?

230
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,940
How should we escape...?

231
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,361
I've never seen Sasuke...

232
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,947
so worked up.

233
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,289
Sasuke, a snake!

234
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:32,589
Shoot! I was too shaken up
to notice the snake!

235
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,685
Don't come near me!

236
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,339
Don't lower your guard,
not even for a moment...

237
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:22,639
A prey must always stay tense
and try to flee desperately...

238
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,559
before a predator.

239
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,661
Ahh... Huh?!

240
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,746
Sorry Sasuke..

241
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,130
Naruto!

242
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,804
The password... I forgot it!

243
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,228
Hey, can you hear it?

244
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,981
The clear,

245
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:19,153
blue sky goes on and on

246
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,115
The ocean

247
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:28,287
spans limitlessly

248
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,290
Please keep

249
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:37,088
that smile on your face forever

250
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,261
Or else I'll cry

251
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,306
You won't have to search around you

252
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,269
It's all ok now.

253
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,733
Everyone is inside

254
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,111
this hand

255
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:05,283
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

256
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:09,787
When you forget what happiness is

257
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,833
Just sing.

258
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:19,005
Light is born, and darkness was born

259
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,257
The two are one

260
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,680
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

261
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,603
Hey, can you hear it?

262
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,941
Hey, hey , hey!

263
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:43,696
It looks like you bullied
weaklings while I was gone.

264
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,407
That explosion and
that huge snake,

265
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,201
it's all your fault, isn't it?

266
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,578
You darn snake bastard!

267
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:55,374
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki, is here,
I'll wipe the floor with you!

268
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,921
Next episode: "Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!"

269
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,465
Look forward to my kicking butt!
