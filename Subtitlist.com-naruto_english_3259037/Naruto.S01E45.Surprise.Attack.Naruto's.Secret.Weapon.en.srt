1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,551
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,304
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,809
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,603
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,357
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,903
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,409
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,496
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,751
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,378
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,797
Now

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,436
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,729
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,775
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:11,447
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,948
If you're not the one

17
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,533
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:20,581
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,140
I'm going...

20
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,601
to become the Hokage.

21
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,230
I can't lose here!

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,357
You? Hokage?!

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,859
When you're weaker than me?

24
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,614
I'll become...Hokage for you!

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,662
Transform!

26
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,501
Hey hey, are you serious?

27
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,669
You've been here three years

28
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,004
and you can't even do
a respectable transformation?!

29
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,049
All of you watch now!

30
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,470
I will absolutely someday become
the true and a real Hokage!

31
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,893
Lame! What Hokage?!

32
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:29,650
You know deep down inside that
you can't become the Hokage.

33
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,360
So quit acting tough!

34
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,446
You're wrong Kiba...

35
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,720
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage...

36
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,434
You...will be the loser!

37
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,899
Surprise Attack! Naruto's Surprise Weapon!

38
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,745
Man! Same thing over and over again.
You're pesky!

39
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,500
Well, never mind.

40
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:32,796
I'll just make it so
you won't stand up again!

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,715
Let's go, Akamaru!

42
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,176
You think you can get me with
that same technique again?!

43
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,304
Take this!

44
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,245
Darn!

45
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,417
Fang Over Fang!

46
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,799
This Jutsu...

47
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,592
Though, I've seen it before...

48
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,387
it's not a Jutsu you can dodge
over and over!

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,639
What do I do?

50
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,643
What should I do?!

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,321
Looks like you've got nothing left.

52
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,907
I've got plenty left!

53
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:46,161
Even if you increased yourself by
three or four, I'd still have a lot left!

54
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,456
You've got a comeback for everything!

55
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,001
Let's finish him with the next! Akamaru!

56
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,312
Darn!

57
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,773
I have to counterattack somehow.

58
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:21,280
Even if I do, it has to get Kiba
or there's no point!

59
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,700
But which is which...?

60
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,622
W-What will you do? Naruto!

61
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,584
Naruto...

62
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,548
T-That's it!

63
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,011
Transform!

64
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,391
You're mine!

65
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,485
I see how it is...

66
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,446
-Huh?
-There, look closely.

67
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,994
Oh!

68
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,798
You did it! That's a clever move, Naruto!

69
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,258
Naruto!

70
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,469
If he transforms into Kiba,

71
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:30,099
the real Kiba doesn't know which is
Akamaru and which is Naruto...

72
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,601
He can't attack carelessly.

73
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,231
However, it's okay for Naruto
to attack either one!

74
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,066
Oooh!

75
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,485
He created a chance opening...

76
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,736
Good work!

77
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,656
I see, so that's your move...

78
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,241
But...

79
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,952
I'll give you a piece of advice!

80
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,664
I was careless before and
a little late to realize it...

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,667
But the Transformation Jutsu
isn't effective anymore!

82
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,628
Why, you ask?

83
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,506
Yeah!

84
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,262
I can smell you.

85
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,684
Don't mess with our
sense of smell, Naruto.

86
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,065
By concentrating his Chakra into his nose,

87
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,152
Kiba's sense of smell is enhanced tens
of thousands times more than average.

88
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:28,157
Of course, he can determine
people by their smell too.

89
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,950
I won!

90
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,079
W-What?!

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,877
What's going on?!

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,422
Kiba's nose got Naruto and
Akamaru mixed up?

93
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,555
Darn! What in the world is going on...?!

94
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,226
Then you're Naruto!

95
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,187
Messing with me!

96
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,234
What?!

97
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,328
Well, this is coming from
the original prankster, after all...

98
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,038
He's had it!

99
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,801
He did it!

100
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,722
Naruto... Awesome!

101
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,156
Darn it!

102
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,036
So that's it...

103
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,789
Naruto, transformed into Kiba,

104
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,458
was discovered by the real Kiba
with smell and hit...

105
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,339
But Naruto didn't come back
in true Naruto form.

106
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,549
Instead, he transformed into
Akamaru instantly!

107
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
In order to make it look as if it
was Akamaru who was hit

108
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,015
and his impersonation
transformation dissolved!

109
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,978
Was Naruto ever that smart...?

110
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,149
You little...!

111
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,903
Think hard about your Jutsu
before you use them!

112
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,407
Because they'll be used
against you, stupid!

113
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,329
He's using my line, word to word...

114
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,041
Arguing with this guy is only
a waste of time!

115
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,294
Don't go at Naruto's pace...

116
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,045
Calm down.

117
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,841
Calm down!

118
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,724
He can't actually keep up with
my movements yet...

119
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,809
I still have the advantage!

120
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,316
Look closely at Naruto's movements
and if there's an opening...

121
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,485
I can surely take him from
behind with the All-Four Jutsu.

122
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,739
Nothing to get flustered about...

123
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,492
If I do this in a level-headed manner,
it's a match I will most certainly win!

124
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,579
Evidently your enemy has become calm...

125
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,457
Well, what will you do, Naruto...?

126
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,339
So you've finally gotten serious, Kiba?

127
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,550
Well then... I'll end this...

128
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,638
with my new special technique
I've been saving up!

129
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,186
So you've finally gotten serious, Kiba?

130
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,397
Well then...I'll end this...

131
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:51,485
with my new special technique
I've been saving up!

132
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,944
What?!

133
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,448
New special trick?!

134
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,451
Huh? When did he...?!

135
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,205
Leave it to Naruto to hide
a new technique!

136
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,957
What new special technique!

137
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,667
That's obviously a bluff!

138
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,380
You can test out whether
it's a bluff or not!

139
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,633
This hasn't changed since before...

140
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,010
Don't let his pace get to you.

141
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,345
Calm down!

142
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,180
Let's go!

143
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,641
I don't know what kind of
technique this is but...!

144
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,601
I just won't let you do it!

145
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,068
Now!

146
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,904
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry...
All-Four Jutsu!

147
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,202
Q-Quick...

148
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,125
Why are you stopping?!

149
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,088
Naruto!

150
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,756
Naruto!

151
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,185
Just as I thought, this is as
far as he will go.

152
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,109
Stand up! Naruto!

153
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:20,532
D-Darn! I don't even have time
to work up my Chakra!

154
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,368
Hey hey! What's wrong?!

155
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,494
Naruto!

156
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,212
He's fast!

157
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,424
It's no good.
He doesn't have time to form hand Signs!

158
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,427
There's too much of a difference
in their strength...

159
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,387
It's impossible for Naruto, after all.

160
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,852
Naruto...

161
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,483
D-Darn!

162
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,403
Take this!

163
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,829
What?!

164
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,373
Take that!

165
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,932
I'm going to be Hokage!

166
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,519
I won't lose here!

167
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,814
Whatever! You can't keep up
with my speed at all!

168
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,459
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!

169
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,840
Naruto!

170
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,723
This is what it's like when
I really let it out.

171
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,693
You understand, don't you?

172
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,697
To me, you're merely...!

173
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,731
I...

174
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,817
Huh?

175
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,280
will absolutely not lose!

176
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,619
That Naruto... He's a fighter.

177
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,245
Yup.

178
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,750
If I were Kiba,
I'd be sick of this already.

179
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,713
It doesn't matter which anymore,
I just wish they'd settle it quickly.

180
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,923
Naruto...

181
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,675
Fight!

182
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,679
Naruto! Use the new technique or whatever!
Just settle it!

183
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,140
Naruto! Go for it!

184
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,236
I have to find some opening
in that darn Kiba...

185
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,739
You've got absolutely no effect on me!

186
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,825
You've got spirit, I'll give you that!

187
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,870
He's close at his end...

188
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,705
I'll settle it with the next one!

189
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,334
I'll make the new technique
explode no matter what!

190
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,086
I won't let you!

191
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,713
You're slow!

192
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,424
Take this!

193
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,902
Fast movements and a keen nose...

194
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,905
The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry
turned out to be harmful...

195
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,241
Right now Kiba's sense of smell
is tens of thousands times

196
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,451
more powerful than normal...

197
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,083
Well... That fart was probably
a freak accident, but...

198
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,837
That's what you'd expect from
the number one unpredictable Ninja.

199
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,588
Naruto!

200
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,590
Now's your chance!

201
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,344
Darn! I was straining too much...

202
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,640
But now's the time to show
my new technique!

203
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,518
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

204
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,731
Naruto!

205
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,567
Okay! The way you've torn me
apart up until now,

206
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,444
I'll give it back all at once!

207
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,035
D-Darn it!

208
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,418
U-!

209
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,257
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!

210
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,978
Naruto...Barrage!

211
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,999
A new technique, eh?

212
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, he was watching Sasuke's
technique a moment ago...

213
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,057
Lion Barrage!

214
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,018
For the record, the name
is a rip off, too.

215
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,874
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

216
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,335
Ohhhh!

217
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,837
Cha!

218
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,463
Nice one!

219
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,298
You did it!

220
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,969
That Naruto beat Kiba!

221
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,804
It's a major upset...

222
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,305
Yup!

223
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,724
Yes!

224
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,074
I'm...getting stronger!

225
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,125
That was easy!

226
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,421
W-What to do?

227
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,089
What should I do...?

228
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,638
N-Naruto...

229
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,600
Huh? Hinata?

230
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,059
Did you say something?

231
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,483
Ah, ah, ah... Umm...

232
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,493
Huh?

233
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,995
Hinata...?

234
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,665
What's this?

235
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,877
It's an ointment.

236
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,420
Why for me?

237
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,347
Take it for her, Naruto.

238
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,643
Okay!

239
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,812
Thank you! You're nice, Hinata!

240
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,778
Kiba, it's nothing to be
embarrassed about ...

241
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,365
This kid was a really strong opponent.

242
00:20:55,964 --> 00:21:00,927
You are taking this pretty easy,
aren't you, Lady Hinata...?

243
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,395
Hey, can you hear it?

244
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:17,443
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

245
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,577
The ocean spans limitlessly

246
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:35,670
Please keep that smile on your face forever

247
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,386
Or else I'll cry

248
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,265
You won't have to search around you

249
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,144
It's all ok now.

250
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,607
Everyone

251
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,194
is inside this hand

252
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,199
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

253
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,746
When you forget what happiness is

254
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,791
Just sing.

255
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,963
Light is born, and darkness was born

256
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,215
The two are one

257
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,930
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

258
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:33,186
Hey, can you hear it?

259
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,108
What's with that guy!

260
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,819
Calling people failure and judging them!

261
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:45,615
Blah blah blah blah blah blah!
Talking like a wise guy!

262
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,783
I'm in a bad mood!

263
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,785
Hinata, you say something!

264
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,745
Get that guy!

265
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:55,374
Show that guy that people
can really change!

266
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,587
Next episode:
"Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!"

267
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,257
Go! Fight! Hinata!
