1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,270
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,000
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,100
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,920
let's start walking

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,963
One more time

23
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,843
Sakura!

24
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,138
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu
in survival training

25
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:38,140
during the Genin Exam.

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,936
You truly have a talent for it.

27
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:43,646
Huh?

28
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,066
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!

29
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,194
Naruto will be delighted.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,655
He'll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

31
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,407
What do you mean by a mission?

32
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,701
Be careful...

33
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,414
It's the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

34
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,878
Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!

35
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,887
Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked
mission in the condition we are in?!

36
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,389
What do we have to do?!

37
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,059
Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company
of the Sand Village.

38
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,728
Sakura...

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,148
Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru,

40
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,733
and go after Sasuke.

41
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,074
I feel uneasy...
about that unusual Chakra.

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,710
But then,

43
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,962
we should wake up Ino and Choji
and go in a large group.

44
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,090
There may already
be quite a large number

45
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,926
of Sand and Sound Shinobi
who have infiltrated this village.

46
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,807
Actions lose quickness when there's more
than the fundamental four in a squad...

47
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,643
and it becomes difficult to
hide from the enemy.

48
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,065
You learned that in the Academy's
patrol practical training, right?

49
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:11,942
Oh, I see!

50
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,905
Then four means
that you'll come with us...

51
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,908
No, I must not leave here.

52
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,492
Summoning Jutsu!

53
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,836
As for the rest, this Pakkun will
track down Sasuke by scent!

54
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,174
C-Could it be...
the one other member is this puppy?!

55
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,095
Hey! Little girl!

56
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,557
Don't you be calling me a cute puppy!

57
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,977
I didn't say...cute.

58
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,273
Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru!

59
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,025
Okay!

60
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,458
Release!

61
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,885
What is it...Sakura?

62
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,054
Get down!

63
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,599
I'll tell you later!
Just stay down!

64
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,735
Shikamaru...you were...
from the beginning...

65
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,659
Owwee!

66
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,328
You were able to release Genjutsu, too!

67
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,580
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!

68
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,625
Humph! I don't want to
end up getting involved!

69
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,170
Heck no...
I could care less about Sasuke!

70
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,300
Owwee!

71
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,403
W-What's going on...?

72
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,071
Naruto! Behind you!

73
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,910
F-Fast...

74
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,495
Not just fast...

75
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,293
Guy Sensei!

76
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,380
Now, I'll announce the mission!

77
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,716
As soon as you've heard what
the mission is, go through that hole.

78
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,928
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!

79
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,098
Then await next orders
in a safe place.

80
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,143
Huh? Did something happen
to Sasuke?!

81
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,312
I'll tell you the reason en route!

82
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,397
Let's go!

83
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,151
Jeez... Why me?

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,570
-Hey, boy!
-Huh...?

85
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,739
If this mission is a success,

86
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,950
as a reward I'll let you
touch my paw-pads.

87
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,578
-So don't sulk like that!
-Huh?

88
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,954
See?

89
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,040
They're soft and supple!

90
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,125
Su..pple...?

91
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,002
Yes, very...

92
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,548
Soft and Supple!

93
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,929
Let's just go!

94
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,516
H-Hey!

95
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,479
Will it be okay with just them?

96
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,358
They'll be okay.
Pakkun is with them.

97
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,361
As long as they don't pursue too far...

98
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,091
To think I'd be able to fight you again...

99
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,307
This barrier can't be broken
unless it's from the inside.

100
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,146
If Lord Hokage would just
take out one of those four,

101
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,647
we could help...

102
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,484
Hey, it's gonna start soon.

103
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,320
Put up a barrier on the inside, too!

104
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,697
Sure!

105
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,215
Hm... It doesn't look like
I'll be able to get out this easily.

106
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,718
You don't really mean that.

107
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,178
It'd be tougher for you

108
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,640
if someone
came in and got in the way, right?

109
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,658
Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!

110
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,954
That's too easy!

111
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,332
Striking Shadow Snake!

112
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,464
With such a weak technique...

113
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:29,718
It sucks to get old, eh,
Sarutobi Sensei?

114
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,810
Substitution?!

115
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,236
Earth Style: Great Mud River!

116
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,075
Is this it?

117
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,910
I don't think so!

118
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,204
Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!

119
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,584
Fire Dragon Bomb!

120
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,926
He's combined Earth and Fire!

121
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,678
Excellent, Lord Hokage!

122
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,231
Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.

123
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,695
Very good...

124
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,450
Really, I've been grossly underestimated.

125
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:40,414
Did you think you could kill me
with that level of Jutsu?

126
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,876
Humph... A hateful fellow as usual!

127
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,337
Don't say that.

128
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,633
A high maintenance student is cute.

129
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,593
Right, Sarutobi Sensei?

130
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,484
Something's strange...

131
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,196
All of the Academy's classes
doing self-study.

132
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,949
And that smoke...

133
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,077
That's coming from the direction
of the exam arena.

134
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,041
Isn't there some disturbance
to the east?

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,877
I wonder if something happened...

136
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,130
This is definitely strange!

137
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,475
But sudden self-study is
sure a smack in the eye!

138
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,518
It's been like this for a while!

139
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,439
Yeah. Iruka Sensei
and everyone are late...

140
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,066
Aren't they, Konohamaru?

141
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,784
Konohamaru?

142
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,452
Yikes!

143
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,622
Jeez, what is this?!

144
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,709
And Mom just bought this for me!

145
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,505
I'll loan you my colored pencil.

146
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,881
What're you saying?!

147
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,426
This color is this spring's new color!

148
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,179
Aww, what'll I do?

149
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,067
That is...?

150
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,534
I wonder if Naruto and the others
went to stop Sasuke?

151
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,077
Those brats?

152
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,915
But surely, some Genin won't
be able to make any difference...

153
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,463
Hm? Is this the data of
that kid back there?

154
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,259
You give him too much credit.

155
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,219
Think again!

156
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,014
You'll trip up if you underestimate him.

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,042
Teachers' Office

158
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:35,046
There is information that several units
have already infiltrated the village...!

159
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:40,260
We should evacuate the students
to a safe place right away!

160
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,511
Yes...

161
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,764
And without causing panic
among the students!

162
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,976
Then let's evacuate the students

163
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,769
as soon as possible under
the pretense of an evacuation drill!

164
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,116
Isn't it about time
we stopped playing around?

165
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,119
This isn't an Academy class, so...

166
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,414
You have a point.

167
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,712
Did you foresee your final moments?

168
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,755
I won't go easy on you
just because you're doddering.

169
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,092
I look forward to it.

170
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,803
Depending on your Jutsu,

171
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,014
I might have to have you
start over at the Academy!

172
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,936
Please don't disappoint me too much!

173
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,118
W-Wow...

174
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,661
What Chakra?!

175
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,082
Yeah... It seems the air is
bearing down within the body!

176
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,632
Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!

177
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,765
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!

178
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,976
That technique!

179
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,394
One!

180
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,023
He is using a Summoning Jutsu
as a shield.

181
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,108
And this dead person is...

182
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,359
Two!

183
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,780
I must stop the third one at any cost...!

184
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,073
Three!

185
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,214
It looks like the third one was no good.
Oh well...

186
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,971
It looks like I stopped the third one.

187
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,183
Now, this is where it gets tough...

188
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,896
He summoned those two of all people...

189
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,748
I-It can't be!
Those personages are...!

190
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,000
Those personages are?

191
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,462
Now, what will you do,

192
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,340
Sarutobi Sensei...? No...

193
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,434
Lord...Third Hokage.

194
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,316
Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!

195
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,073
Oh, what a day!

196
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:34,369
My favorite colored pencil
didn't have to break like that!

197
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,791
Lousy evacuation drill...
Self-study was better.

198
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,045
Konohamaru's been quiet, hasn't he?
I wonder what's wrong?

199
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,588
Huh? Yeah.

200
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,050
After the whole school does
a long self-study,

201
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,803
the whole school does
an evacuation drill.

202
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,055
This is too strange!

203
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,517
Okay! Stop! Get in line!

204
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,478
That look on Iruka Sensei's face...

205
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,814
Something's definitely going on here!

206
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,692
And also...

207
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,533
Okay, everyone!
Don't go off on your own.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,254
That rainbow... It's been
bugging me for a while!

209
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,596
What's that, Old Man?

210
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,723
There's a strange rainbow!

211
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,023
It's an unusual rainbow!

212
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,443
Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?

213
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,028
Yeah!

214
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,615
And I've never seen
such a pretty rainbow!

215
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,994
I see, I see.
But, Konohamaru...

216
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,454
Hmm?

217
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,667
Rainbows used to symbolize snakes...

218
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,047
And it's said that they bode evil.

219
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,927
Such a pretty thing? That's a lie!

220
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,179
I see, I see.

221
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,774
Symbolizes snakes...
Is something happening?

222
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,083
Long time no see...Saru.

223
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,504
Oh, it's you...
You've gotten old, Sarutobi.

224
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:55,510
I never thought I would meet
the great brothers in this manner...

225
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,221
It's regretful.

226
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,931
This is bad.

227
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,975
That Summoning Jutsu...

228
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,936
Who in the world are they?!

229
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,397
Please prepare yourselves...

230
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,898
Lord First Hokage...

231
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,900
Lord Second Hokage!

232
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,529
That's right...

233
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,698
The one with the black hair
is the First Hokage.

234
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,075
The one with the white hair
is the Second Hokage.

235
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,871
They are both reputed to
be the highest Shinobi

236
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,915
and they are the Hokages
who built the today's Leaf Village!

237
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,381
Reanimation, huh?

238
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,093
This youth summoned us with
the Forbidden Jutsu, then?

239
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,928
He's something else...

240
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,016
Then, Sarutobi!

241
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:48,104
Does this mean we must...fight you?

242
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,566
Let's stop the old people
get-together talk...

243
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,568
Shall we get started?

244
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,071
There's always fighting...
no matter when you live.

245
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,074
You like that, don't you?

246
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,785
No good will come

247
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,080
by deriding the dead
and playing around with time!

248
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,008
I get it! So that's what happened!

249
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,640
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

250
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,810
So, why am I pulled into this?!
This is such a drag!

251
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,564
It can't be helped!
It's Kakashi Sensei's order.

252
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,360
This way!

253
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,586
That brat, huh...

254
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,964
Let's go!

255
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,812
Everyone makes mistakes

256
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,067
It's nothing to be ashamed about

257
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,322
Don't let this scar be for naught

258
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:27,203
Walk with a smile

259
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,966
Yes, breathe in the air

260
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,635
Lift your face to the sky and jump

261
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,596
If it rains, take a break

262
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,016
Go where the wind takes you

263
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,685
So many regrets

264
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,146
Don't let this scar be for naught

265
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,523
Let's go carve the badges in our chest

266
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,234
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

267
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,489
Everyone makes mistakes

268
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,745
It's nothing to be ashamed about

269
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:14,042
Don't let this scar be for naught

270
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,297
Walk with a smile

271
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,635
Transform sadness into the wind

272
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:29,891
and continue to forge on

273
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:35,688
Forge on strong

274
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,578
Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!

275
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,790
Once we Genin get caught,
that will be the end.

276
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,417
In that case,
we should ambush and attack them.

277
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,586
I already thought of it,
but it'll probably be no use.

278
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,797
Then, what should we do?!

279
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,218
There is only one choice.

280
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,722
Next time, "A Shirker's Call to Action:
Layabout No More!"

281
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,891
It isn't my style,
but we have no choice, I guess.
