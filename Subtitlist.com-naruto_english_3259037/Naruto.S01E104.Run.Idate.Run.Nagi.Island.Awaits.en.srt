1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,729
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:28,320
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

3
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:34,827
That day's faint wind blows away

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,622
at the castle ruins of yesterday

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:44,754
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

6
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:52,303
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

7
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:57,224
That's why it must be good-bye

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:04,231
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

9
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:10,946
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

10
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,912
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

12
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,756
and melting away

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,853
This is not good,
looks like a storm is coming.

14
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,104
What?

15
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,525
Idate...

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,781
Run Idate Run!
Nagi Island Awaits!

17
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,165
Aoi...Rokusho!

18
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,960
I thought you had run away.

19
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,173
Wasn't running away
your specialty?

20
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,133
Shut up!

21
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,635
I'm different from you!

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,931
No, you are the same kind
of human as I am.

23
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,268
A betrayer who doesn't trust others.

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,230
Betraying your own brother,
walking away from the village,

25
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,568
and capable of thinking only of yourself.
The worst kind of man.

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,950
Such a man...
doesn't deserve to live!

27
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,630
Die!

28
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,347
Sakura, is your wound okay?

29
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,724
Uh-huh.

30
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,392
A wound like this is nothing.

31
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,394
But...

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,355
Those Rain Ninja...huh?
Yes.

33
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,692
Hah, they're nothing!

34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,279
No, it's not that!
If they're headed towards Idate...

35
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,284
Oh! Idate is in danger!

36
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,244
That's what I've been saying!

37
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,500
Hey, Naruto!
This is no time to be playing around.

38
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,004
No! They're here now.

39
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,261
Naruto!

40
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,138
Lucky us!

41
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,265
We are invincible in water.

42
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,187
Geez, what a troublesome guy.

43
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,649
They've now fallen into our trap.

44
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,568
Water Clone Jutsu!

45
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,995
Sakura!

46
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,797
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

47
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:29,770
How stupid. What use can
Shadow Clones have in this situation?

48
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:34,441
There's no way they can defeat
our Water Clones in water.

49
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,403
Even if you try to trick us,

50
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,281
I'm hanging on to the real body
right here.

51
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,683
What are they trying to do?

52
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,456
N-No way!

53
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,960
What a whirlpool...
Chakra is intertwined in it!

54
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,920
Naruto...you...

55
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,887
This is the application
of the first step

56
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,765
in my training for
the Rasengan!

57
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,647
Sakura!

58
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,820
Sakura, hang in there!

59
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,043
Sakura! Just hang in there!

60
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,003
Come on! Sakura!

61
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,689
Sakura! ̀Pull yourself together! Sakura!

62
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,652
I-I guess...I've got...to...do it...

63
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,742
S-Sasuke...

64
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,370
I'd like it if Sasuke is the one to do...

65
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,832
the CPR...

66
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,256
S-Sakura...

67
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,302
What the hell are you doing, idiot!

68
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,182
Sasuke?

69
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,644
We don't have any time to spare.
We need to meet up with Idate.

70
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,689
Wait, Sasuke.

71
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,695
Hey... Don't leave me.

72
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,712
It's about time...

73
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,674
Fukusuke reaches Modoroki Shrine.

74
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:53,098
There's no chance for you
to win now.

75
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,816
You can't even run
or stand up now.

76
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,156
When that pain spreads
throughout your whole body,

77
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,492
you'll reach a different finish line.

78
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,250
The finish line of death.

79
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,641
What are you thinking of doing
with that dirty knife?

80
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,645
Don't touch it!

81
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,912
Looks like you still don't understand
your situation.

82
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,375
All you have to do is run away.

83
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,712
You have no right to even
the slightest bit of integrity.

84
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,397
Boss...

85
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,403
I'm sorry...

86
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,405
Boss...

87
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,325
I couldn't keep...

88
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,996
the promise I made with you.

89
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,958
Idate!

90
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,180
You bastard!

91
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,442
Darn, what a downpour.

92
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,528
Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?!

93
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,867
Looks like it was too hard
a task for them.

94
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,368
Even if they were
the same Genin as you,

95
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,038
seems like the Hidden Leaf ones
are better.

96
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:23,790
This is terrible...

97
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,213
But can Genin-level Ninja
fight against me?

98
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,341
Shut up!

99
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,429
Above!

100
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,363
Humph... So that's your level, after all.

101
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,324
I'll use the same method
I used on Idate,

102
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,286
and send you to hell.

103
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,416
No need to waste my Chakra.

104
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,337
Sakura!

105
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,676
Th-These darned things...

106
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,888
Those are poisoned needles specially
made by the Hidden Rain Village.

107
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,765
They will send you to hell
in a few minutes,

108
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,642
no matter how strong you are.

109
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,603
Don't you look down on us! Bastard...!

110
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,443
Looks like Fukusuke has reached
Modoroki Shrine.

111
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,321
Die gasping.

112
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,282
☺It's a death
that fits you Genin brats well.

113
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,043
Is Wagarashi winning this one too?

114
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,879
Isn't there a God or Buddha
in this world?

115
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,384
I miss the old times when
Jirocho was in charge.

116
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,976
Terrible, terrible, I'm drenched.

117
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,894
You are amazing, Fukusuke.

118
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,731
Keep on running to the goal,
and make our Boss Wagarashi happy.

119
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,526
Watch it, you scum.

120
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,403
Who do you think you are talking to?

121
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,904
What?

122
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,992
My victory is already assured.
Let me relax for a while.

123
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,994
Bastard, think you're so hot?!

124
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,662
Cut it out...
Brother...

125
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,914
What if something goes wrong
during the race?

126
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,459
Who knows what our boss
will do to us.

127
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,377
All right.

128
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,920
Just wait and see.

129
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,513
Darn, that bastard!

130
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,265
Naruto, Sasuke...

131
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,017
Take this.

132
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,269
Sakura... What's that?

133
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,607
Before leaving the Leaf Village,

134
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,985
Lady Tsunade handed this to me.

135
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,655
Take this with you.
I am sure it will come in handy.

136
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,532
Old Lady Tsunade?

137
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,581
I think he'll recover
consciousness now.

138
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,751
Sasuke and Naruto,
you take this, too.

139
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,127
O-Okay.

140
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,549
Also, we'll be too cold here,
so we need to move somewhere else.

141
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,971
Brother!

142
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,690
Look! I've finally become
a Ninja, too!

143
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,816
I see...

144
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,153
I've got to become the best
in everything!

145
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,782
I'll train hard,
and complete lots of missions.

146
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,409
And I'll become a Chunin super fast.

147
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,912
Then after that, a Jonin.

148
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,956
I'm going to be like you, Brother!

149
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,668
I'm Idate, the Swift Runner
making headway in life.

150
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,545
Brother?

151
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,925
Listen Idate...

152
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,886
In the world of Shinobi,

153
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,306
there is something more important
than success or power.

154
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,391
Something more important?

155
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,896
Until you understand that,
it's too early for you to talk that way.

156
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,117
Oh! He's conscious now.

157
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,369
Are you okay?

158
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,746
What happened to Aoi?!

159
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,748
He disappeared...

160
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,209
So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?

161
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,548
Idate, do you know him?

162
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,259
He...

163
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,387
was a teacher when
I was in the Leaf Village.

164
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,139
You...are from the Leaf Village?

165
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,310
Aoi...betrayed the Leaf Village

166
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,395
and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.

167
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,189
What the hell do you mean?

168
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,152
Not yet.

169
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,613
You have to rest a little more.

170
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,240
How is your hand there?

171
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,995
That hand...
You kept it clenched all this time.

172
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,629
Darn! I'd come all this way,
and yet I...!

173
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,089
It's too early to give up!

174
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,092
And you tell us that you were once
a Shinobi of the Leaf?!

175
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,972
I forgot all about the Leaf...

176
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,891
the moment
I walked away from the village.

177
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,101
You walked away from the village?

178
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,816
I was depressed after failing
the first test

179
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,360
of the Chunin Exam.

180
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,530
That was close, Idate...

181
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,244
Don't take it so hard.

182
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:57,332
There are ways to become
a Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.

183
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,000
Really?!

184
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,712
Yes, really.

185
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,965
Just do as I tell you.

186
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,384
Okay!

187
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,184
Aoi Sensei...

188
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,228
Idate...

189
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,816
Aoi Sensei,
I'd brought them as you told me to.

190
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,902
All right.

191
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,323
These are indeed the Scroll of Sealing
and the legendary blade,

192
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,785
the Blade of the Thunder God, believed to
have been used by the Second Hokage.

193
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,204
Well done, Idate.

194
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,499
Now I can become a Chunin, right?

195
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,751
Sure you can...

196
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,214
in the Village Hidden in the Rain.

197
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,262
You are leaving
the Leaf together with me,

198
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,889
taking these as gifts to them.

199
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,182
But...

200
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,562
Of course.

201
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,023
There's no way you can get away with
stealing the village's treasures.

202
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,276
You tricked me!

203
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,197
To survive in this world,
you must not believe in others...

204
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,158
Remember that.

205
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,204
Well, what are you going to do, Idate?

206
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,875
Either way, you are already
a Rogue Ninja.

207
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,672
You'll be chained in jail for life,
if you are lucky.

208
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,431
You'll be chained in jail for life,
if you are lucky.

209
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,942
Ever since then,
I haven't returned to the village.

210
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,822
I am an irresponsible man
who can't do a single thing right.

211
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,700
But Boss Jirocho believed in me.

212
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,831
Even though I'd never
been of any use to him.

213
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,792
Boss Jirocho had faith in me!

214
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,795
And yet, I...!

215
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,802
He's...

216
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,764
He's...like the old me...

217
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,187
No one will ever accept you!
Die Naruto!

218
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,149
Duck down, Naruto!

219
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,449
I'm...a worthless guy...

220
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,869
W-Why?

221
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,122
Because we are the same.

222
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,042
He's like me of the old days.

223
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,086
I go around and around,
and get nowhere...

224
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,256
I can't do anything right.

225
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,132
Aoi is right.

226
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,554
-I have...no right to live...
-You idiot!

227
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,933
There's a person
who still trusts you, right?

228
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,811
I know, Naruto.

229
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,733
You felt alone...
and you were suffering!

230
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,736
One is enough!

231
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,951
The race isn't over yet!

232
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:24,163
You never know how things will turn out
unless you try until the very end.

233
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,041
But...

234
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,751
Stand up now!

235
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,421
Naruto, it's not possible!
Idate's body is still...

236
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,508
If he can't run,
then I'll carry him on my back and run!

237
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,137
The opponent must already be
in Modoroki Shrine...

238
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,014
Don't give up!

239
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,391
Hey... Naruto...

240
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,851
Sasuke...

241
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,812
Let's leave it to Naruto here.

242
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,107
Jirocho is waiting for you, right?

243
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,359
Pull yourself together!

244
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,213
Boss, don't you think
he actually ran away?

245
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,300
He'll come.

246
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,178
I believe in Idate!

247
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,106
If you run away now,
you'll be a loser for your entire life!

248
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,569
For the people who believe
in you and wait for you...

249
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,533
It's the fastest boat around here.

250
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,785
I'm grateful.

251
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,869
No problem.

252
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,998
Edged tools aren't
for hurting people...

253
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,210
Show them what you've got!

254
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,215
Naruto! Please take me there!

255
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,927
All right. Leave it to me!

256
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:18,987
Once in a long while, once in a while

257
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:25,201
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

258
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:30,832
Look like a mountain

259
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,717
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

260
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,556
The remnants of a person crying

261
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,977
Look like a mountain

262
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,939
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

263
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

264
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,196
Shake shake shake
Let's look

265
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

266
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,923
Look like a mountain

267
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,012
Look like a mountain

268
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,599
Look like a mountain

269
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,519
Look like a mountain

270
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,566
9Hey you!

271
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,654
What're you jabbering about,
lecturing like you're something else?!

272
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,573
You are so annoying!

273
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,533
Come on, Idate.

274
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,410
Boss Jirochi is waiting for you
at the finish line, right?

275
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,789
I don't care if this guy
is a Jonin or whatever.

276
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,542
I'm gonna beat him and make for
the finish line with all my might!

277
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:01,631
Next time:
"A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder!'
