1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,837
Rock away your existence,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,631
Shouting that you are here...

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,762
A new journey begins now.

4
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,112
As we survived through
the changing seasons,

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,576
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,203
But the forgotten memories,

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,832
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,

8
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:44,295
have also been lost.

9
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:51,051
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.

10
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:55,806
But now we've met each other,
we are no longer alone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,479
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,859
Those tears will change your fate.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,945
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,

14
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,740
We're sure to meet,

15
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:18,954
Under the same flag of pain

16
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,430
Naruto!

17
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,227
There was an emergency transmission
from the training room!

18
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,187
What in the world happened?!

19
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,940
Actually, the star was stolen.

20
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,401
The enemy is a Ninja
who flies using Chakra!

21
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,654
No way...!

22
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,366
I've never heard of
a flying Shinobi.

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
Byakugan!

24
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,393
I lost him...

25
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,563
But what Naruto said is true.

26
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,815
To think he can fly
using Chakra...

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,733
That's an incredible Shinobi.

28
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,861
So it was true.

29
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,030
What?! You didn't believe
what I said?!

30
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,156
You could say that.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,992
Wh-What's up with that?

32
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,411
Do I have that little credibility?!

33
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,501
The Remembered Lullaby

34
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,968
So the star of
the Village Hidden in Stars

35
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,720
is a meteorite, huh?

36
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,807
Yes...

37
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,230
The First Hoshikage...

38
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,775
That's what they call
the village leader.

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,905
He discovered that if
you train by the "star..."

40
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,033
Chakra is strengthened.

41
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,662
Ever since then...

42
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,665
the Hidden Star has been
in a unique position

43
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,542
even among the Ninja hidden villages.

44
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,086
But it says in these documents

45
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,715
that the training hasn't been conducted
these past ten years...

46
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,468
The leader who called himself
the Third Hoshikage

47
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,136
prohibited the training...

48
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,263
But about a year ago...

49
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,808
It seems they started again
after that Hoshikage died...

50
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,729
But why? Why do something
like prohibit training...?

51
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,147
Who knows...?

52
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,359
It's a classified matter of
the Village Hidden in the Stars, so...

53
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,571
But there were various rumors
circulating around about it...

54
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,031
Rumors?

55
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:04,411
Yeah... Rumors about most
of the Ninjas who trained dying...

56
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:10,042
Chakra is forcibly strengthened
by the power of the unknown star.

57
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:14,171
There may have been
adverse effects on the body.

58
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,813
What...?

59
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,148
The star was stolen?!

60
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,361
Yes! The people who were
training were at the scene,

61
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,363
but they were all knocked out
by an enemy Jutsu...

62
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,532
Pathetic!

63
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,704
You say that,
but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!

64
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,748
Naruto, is it that incredible?

65
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,710
Yeah! Turning Chakra
into monsters or wings.

66
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,461
It's the first time I ever saw that!

67
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,425
Is that true...Sumaru?

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,801
Yes!

69
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,846
It's the Ninja Art: Kujaku,
no mistake!

70
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,354
That's the Jutsu passed on
in the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?

71
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,482
Yeah... As for that Jutsu, only those
who have mastered the star training can...

72
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,567
Sumaru!

73
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,610
Tenten...

74
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:22,656
The secrets of a Jutsu are not to
be spoken of or asked about lightly.

75
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,785
Especially with a Jutsu that can only
be passed on to those of that village...

76
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,621
I'm sorry...

77
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,668
Lord Akahoshi,
please give me an order!

78
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,338
The star being stolen
is my responsibility.

79
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,423
No...

80
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,508
The star was stolen

81
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,926
even though we were commissioned
a mission to protect it.

82
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,595
It's also our responsibility.

83
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,890
We will get the star back by
our own hands, no matter what!

84
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,603
Yes... I will leave the search for
the star to the Leaf Shinobi...

85
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,856
Sumaru, you keep an eye
on your injured comrades.

86
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,567
But only those in the village
know village matters...!

87
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,777
It's an order!

88
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,084
Hey! Are your friends who got beaten up
by the enemy Ninja okay?

89
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,169
That's none of your business!

90
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,337
What...?!

91
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,048
At the end of the day,
you're still Ninja from some other village!

92
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,300
You're not my friends or anything!

93
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,512
What's with him?!

94
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,264
Neji, you're talking about
taking responsibility,

95
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,975
but we haven't even seen
the scene of the theft.

96
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,104
That's right...
And we don't have any leads.

97
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,814
No, we do.

98
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,817
You didn't pick up on it?

99
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,195
Akahoshi the village leader
knows something!

100
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,405
What do you mean by
knowing something?

101
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,657
Come to think of it,

102
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,493
when Sumaru was talking about
the Kujaku something or other,

103
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,702
his expression changed.

104
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,915
Then that means the culprit is
someone associated with this village?

105
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,709
So, like I said, what does this mean?!

106
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,045
I'll make a go around the village

107
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,089
and look for something that
could make for a lead.

108
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,926
Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over
that village leader called Akahoshi.

109
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
I understand!

110
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,637
Leave it to us!

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,224
I don't get it!
What the heck should I do?!

112
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,645
Let me see...
You investigate from Sumaru's angle.

113
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,857
All right! Leave Sumaru to me.

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,067
Then, I'm off for a run!

115
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,902
Same as always...

116
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,738
Naruto sure is
an impetuous person, isn't he?

117
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:50,345
♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?

118
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:55,934
Because I had a sad dream last night.

119
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:02,524
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed

120
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:07,362
Swollen as I cried...

121
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,785
Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?

122
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:19,833
I'm searching for a child
who has gone afar

123
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,964
My sad dreams

124
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,802
come once more. ♪

125
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,061
Hey Sumaru!

126
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,897
What're you doing?!

127
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,484
Nothing! I was just looking
at the stars!

128
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,027
Stars?

129
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,531
Come to think of it,
you can see the stars well in this village.

130
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,743
That red star's sure pretty...

131
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,161
Natsuhiboshi...

132
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,873
It watches over me all the time...

133
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,833
Huh?

134
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:06,922
H-Hey... Hold it. I want to go
visit your friends.

135
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,215
Look, here...

136
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,094
I've brought the Hidden Leaf specialty
Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!

137
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,846
Go if you like!
It's right near the training room!

138
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,265
Huh?

139
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,395
A cold-hearted guy as usual...

140
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,041
What? Is nobody here?

141
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
Sorry to bother you.

142
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,508
Where is everyone?

143
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,553
Oh, is somebody sleeping?

144
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,899
Stop it... Hokuto.

145
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,112
I can tell... He's not an enemy.

146
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,780
Mizura...!

147
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:14,906
You little!
145.0101:35:28:2101:35:32:04Oh, ouch...

148
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,789
A girl...?

149
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,792
Who are you?

150
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,047
I'm a Ninja from the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!

151
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,841
I came to this village
to protect the star!

152
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,344
Y-You are...?

153
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm sorry for my rough behavior!

154
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,725
It's cool. I just came to visit...

155
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,187
Where's the Roasted
Chestnut Bean Jelly...?

156
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,484
Oh! That's it!

157
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,110
Oh, no!

158
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,155
There's no mistake...

159
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,577
Then it was that person who
made off with the star, after all...

160
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,913
So you're saying that one's still alive...?

161
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,123
Then this will be difficult.

162
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,709
That one being the final Ninja
completely trained

163
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,670
in the power of the star means...

164
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,465
Not an opponent we can handle
with the likes of our Jutsu!

165
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't get flustered...

166
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,427
If the culprit is who we think it is,

167
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,430
we already hold that one's weakness
in our hands.

168
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,809
I get it...

169
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,895
Then let's grab that person up.

170
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,021
Wait...

171
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:37,114
First we must avert the eyes
of the annoying flies!

172
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,788
I'm sorry...
My name is Hokuto...

173
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,791
I felt Chakra from someone not
of this village...

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,751
I carelessly...

175
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,802
Well, the flavor won't change, so eat up.

176
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,303
Okay...

177
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,269
Oh my... It really is good!

178
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,812
Right? Right?

179
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,234
Say... What happened to the others?

180
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,279
The thief just put us to sleep...

181
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,573
There wasn't such a great deal
of damage.

182
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,824
I see.

183
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,246
You okay?

184
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,583
Thanks for saving my butt back there!

185
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,919
Is there something wrong with you?

186
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,797
No...nothing at all...

187
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,135
After Mizura began the star training,
he started to feel poorly...

188
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,512
Hokuto! Don't be talking about the star

189
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,972
to someone from another village!

190
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,058
Are you okay, Mizura...?!

191
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,688
I'm sorry. I got carried away...

192
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,734
Other village...
You guys are kind of cold-hearted.

193
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,360
Especially that Sumaru guy...

194
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,112
I'm sorry...

195
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,240
But there's a reason
why Sumaru became like that.

196
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,366
What?

197
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,579
It happened ten years ago...

198
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,671
Sumaru's parents who
were protecting the star

199
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,718
were killed by Ninja from
some other village...

200
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,969
who came to steal the star.

201
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,515
So probably, he's...

202
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,810
So that's what it was about...
That's why he got like that.

203
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,486
So where is Sumaru...?
And where the other guys?

204
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,490
It seems everyone went
to take back the star.

205
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,200
Huh?!

206
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:46,785
Oh!

207
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,788
Naru...to?

208
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,635
-They've come out.
-Right...

209
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,054
We should take them on
fair and square here...

210
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,765
Idiot! There'd be no point
to surveillance!

211
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,768
I'm not much one for
sniffing around secretly.

212
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,980
Be quiet. They'll notice us!

213
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:24,072
Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to me...
Follow me quietly!

214
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,198
But...

215
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,283
It's a mission!

216
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,868
I understand...

217
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,453
Let's go...!

218
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,122
Secretly, secretly...

219
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,511
It's okay... They haven't noticed.

220
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,682
But I get the feeling this kind of thing
goes against my Way of Ninja...

221
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,975
Don't complain!

222
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,852
Secretly, secretly...

223
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,562
You don't need to say secretly, secretly!

224
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,648
But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?

225
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,152
Uh-oh...

226
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,030
Have we been noticed?

227
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,114
Wait...

228
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,841
It appears we weren't noticed...

229
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,468
Let's continue trailing them!

230
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,223
Right! They turned right!

231
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,850
R-Roger!

232
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,272
They vanished...

233
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,650
Did they give us the slip?

234
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,444
Could it be, they noticed us?

235
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,039
Wait...! We're not enemies!

236
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,123
That's right!

237
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,834
We came here on a mission from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

238
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,046
Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?

239
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,008
Then aren't you guys trailing
the wrong people?

240
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,510
That might be so.

241
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,429
But there's the possibility that
you guys have transformed

242
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,098
into people from this village, so...

243
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,017
Brave words.

244
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,769
I apologize for the rudeness...

245
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,230
But now the star has been stolen.

246
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,440
And we don't have any leads...

247
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,486
So that's why
you were investigating us, huh...?

248
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,364
That was unnecessary...

249
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,284
Oh well... We will take back
the star with our own hands.

250
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,163
You guys just make sure
you don't get in our way!

251
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,958
They kind of tick me off...

252
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,085
But it's as Neji said...

253
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,046
It seems there's some kind
of secret in this village, eh?

254
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,548
Seems so...

255
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,264
Everyone...join hands!

256
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,354
Listen up! Pick up the same
star Chakra as us!

257
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,215
There he is!

258
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,402
You can't cut a rope woven
with Chakra!

259
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,367
Give back the star!
That's our life!

260
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,003
Neji, have you seen Sumaru
and the others?

261
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,214
You weren't keeping watch of him?

262
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:14,427
Actually, it seems most of the guys
went out to look for the star.

263
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,387
I see...

264
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,932
Hey... is it okay to be all relaxed?

265
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,611
Hey, is something wrong?

266
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,364
There's massive Chakra
at the Valley of Death.

267
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,157
Did he appear again?!

268
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,034
-Let's go!
-All right!

269
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,949
G-Give back our...star...

270
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,034
Give it back...

271
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,256
Hold it!

272
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,133
Eat this!

273
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,761
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

274
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,605
I won't let you get away!

275
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,902
Hold it!

276
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,361
Farewell!

277
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,779
Wh-What?!

278
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,827
Damn you!

279
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,037
Wait!

280
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,456
Let me go! Let me go, I say!

281
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,582
Calm down!

282
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,752
Up ahead is the valley filled
with poison gas...

283
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,009
O-Okay...

284
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,431
You would've been dead meat in
a few seconds without that mask on...

285
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,308
Damn it. We almost had him.

286
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,519
So that was the Shinobi
who stole the star?

287
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,022
Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!

288
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,692
Why? Why is it necessary
to go out of his way

289
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,986
to take Sumaru away although
he carried out his goal already?

290
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,573
Does that have something to do

291
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,951
with the star being targeted
ten years ago?

292
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:49,540
At that time, it seems Sumaru's parents
got killed protecting the star.

293
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,750
What?!

294
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:16,234
Yesterday's Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.

295
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:23,032
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

296
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,506
Yellow Moon.

297
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:45,346
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes

298
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,560
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

299
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:57,483
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another's back

300
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:04,490
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

301
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:11,080
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of

302
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:18,046
Right away, my messy feelings as is,

303
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:24,635
A magical chord change, in a restless city

304
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,684
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key

305
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,152
We need to reinvestigate
the village leader and his relations.

306
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,405
Please leave it to me!
I've got an ace strategy.

307
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,823
A strategy?

308
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,701
I can't count on Tenten's
trailing Ninjutsu, can I?

309
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,786
What did you say?!

310
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,662
Do whatever you want.
Just follow through with it.

311
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,164
All right! Here I go!

312
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,540
We'll see how good you are.

313
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:55,875
Then, me, too...

314
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,960
Hold it, Naruto.

315
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,506

The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku."
