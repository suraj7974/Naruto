1
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,416
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:45,421
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,593
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,847
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,561
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,034
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,206
What were you gazing at?

15
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,191
Ah, which way is it?!

16
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,318
There's a faint scent of salt water...

17
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,616
We were almost there...

18
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,663
Then I'll use
my Rasengan to...

19
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,041
Wait! If it doesn't go well,
we'll be crushed under the ceiling.

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,836
If so, what should we do?!

21
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,004
Everyone, step backward.

22
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,802
What?!

23
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,190
Phew, we're safe...!

24
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,609
Anko Sensei!

25
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,655
Let's get moving...
It's already morning.

26
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,574
Oh no!

27
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,033
The ships collecting funds
are in danger...!

28
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,369
We've got to follow them
right away!

29
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,289
With that ship!

30
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,665
Okay, let's go!

31
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,671
You've had no contact
from the Ninja of the Leaf Village?

32
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,674
They were told to
accompany the ship.

33
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,010
What in the world happened?

34
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,847
Captain, we just received
communication.

35
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,350
I see!

36
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,396
That's what I expect
from elite Ninja!

37
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,023
It seems they finished

38
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,983
the suppression of
the Demon of the Ocean last night.

39
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,610
– Oh...
– Oh!

40
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,196
Excellent...
So now the ships are safe.

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,491
Of course.
Men, take your positions!

42
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,118
We'll depart.

43
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:32,171
Despair: A Fractured Heart

44
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,966
Be careful of the reef!

45
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,807
I don't see any ships that look like
those that collect funds in the port.

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,061
How could they depart without us?

47
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,315
Have they already fallen
into Amachi's scheme...?

48
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,621
C-Captain Hitode...

49
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,374
What happened?!

50
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,668
There's something there!
The bottom of the ship...!

51
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,640
Confirm the enemy!

52
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,724
R-Roger!

53
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,937
Huh? What?

54
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,651
Full toward port!

55
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,404
I can't steer!

56
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,488
What?

57
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,090
It's no good. It won't move.

58
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,218
We're going to hit, everyone.
Grab onto something!

59
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,530
This must be the attack from
the Demon of the Ocean?

60
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,534
Thank you for working hard
for transporting the funds.

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,952
I saw you while ago!

62
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,250
Identify yourself!

63
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,170
If you hand this ship over
without resistance,

64
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,963
I will save your life.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,423
Don't mess with me!

66
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,895
– It's the Demon of the Ocean...
– A monster!

67
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,489
Demon Illusion: Fire Jutsu.

68
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,910
Wh-What...?

69
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,328
Th-That's...

70
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,542
It's fire torture...!

71
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,268
Yoroi, take care of the rest.

72
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,790
What?!

73
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,587
I'm your opponent!

74
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,510
Everyone, hang in there!

75
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,847
Don't be so nasty!

76
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,183
We meet again, weirdo!

77
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,355
Excuse me, but I still have
something to ask you.

78
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,899
What are you doing, Isaribi!

79
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,069
Cut it out already!

80
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,572
Keep this up and you'll really turn
into the Demon of the Ocean!

81
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,492
Do it, Isaribi.

82
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,253
Your opponent is right here.

83
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,673
You said that Orochimaru left

84
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,717
that research facility
half a month ago...

85
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,428
Where did he go?

86
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,054
I don't know...

87
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,017
Now that you mention it,
Orochimaru had a kid in tow.

88
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,645
I heard that the kid is
really excellent, unlike you.

89
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,273
Sasuke Uchiha.

90
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,193
Something about you
just wasn't enough.

91
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,153
That's why you were abandoned,
I guess.

92
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,202
Isarirbi?!

93
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,167
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

94
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,666
Isaribi...

95
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,797
I bet you still understand
what I've been saying to you, Isaribi!

96
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:13,095
Don't you care a bit after
tormenting everyone this much?

97
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,806
No.

98
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:22,479
I think nothing of...
even bringing you down...

99
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,816
That's a lie!

100
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,202
It doesn't matter to me
who gets injured...

101
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,704
or who drowns...

102
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,166
I'm satisfied as long as
I can return to being a human!

103
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,965
It's about time to come
to yourself!

104
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:03,020
I understand painfully
enough how you feel...

105
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,858
But...doing that...
It's not good!

106
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,955
Isaribi, you saved me.
You have a kind heart!

107
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,395
Pretty good for a Medical Ninja.

108
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,522
Shut up!

109
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,192
I'm a little surprised that

110
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,318
you had enough time
to take your eyes off...

111
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,244
D-Damn it!

112
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,291
You're too confident...

113
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,379
You're useless.

114
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,672
How long you think
you'll be doing this?

115
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,633
Amachi...

116
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,009
He's just a kid.

117
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,303
Why can't you finish him off
right away?

118
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,639
Sorry. But...

119
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,808
I can't take it anymore.
Get out of my way!

120
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,063
Bring it on.
I'll kill a damn monster like you!

121
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,732
Monster? Me?

122
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,734
That's right!

123
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,196
You so easily injure
and kill people.

124
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,699
You're a monster wearing
human skin!

125
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,039
Hey! What's so funny!

126
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,250
If so, what then?

127
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,670
I'm not some half-monster
like Isaribi...

128
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,298
I'm...

129
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:51,396
further refined than her and
fully integrated for combat use!

130
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,689
You...!

131
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,483
Amachi...!

132
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,901
Get out of my way!

133
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,236
You're an almost-dead guinea pig...

134
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,910
What are you doing?!

135
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,080
Even though we were supposed to dissect
and use her as material for experiments,

136
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,875
we took pity on her and
kept her alive.

137
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,921
But after all,
she's terribly ungrateful and useless.

138
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,676
What's wrong...kid?

139
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,099
You! You're not only
a monster in body and soul!

140
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,353
In truth, you're scum!

141
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,440
C'mere... I'll play with you.

142
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,067
Bastard!

143
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,027
Idiot!

144
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,451
Hah, amateurish...

145
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,620
Not over yet!

146
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,040
Shadow Clone Jutsu

147
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,384
No matter how many times
you come at me,

148
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,468
you'll get the same thing!

149
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,768
Well, what's wrong, little guy?

150
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,567
You're going to come again, huh?

151
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,697
Yeah, of course!
Until you change Isaribi back...

152
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,575
I'll come at you again and again.

153
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,202
Water Style:
Great Cannonball Jutsu!

154
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,132
What's wrong,
you're done already?

155
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,094
Give it up already, kid!

156
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,347
I told you!

157
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,895
Until I take Isaribi back...

158
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,984
I absolutely will not...quit!

159
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,707
Why...

160
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,292
would you go that
far to save me?

161
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,881
I can't keep up with the farce.

162
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,093
Come on! Sea Monster!

163
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,018
Do it...Sea Monster!

164
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,988
Hey! Let go of me, you!

165
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,913
Let me tell you that almost all of
Sea Monster's body is made of water.

166
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,875
You can say it's like
a moving Water Prison Jutsu.

167
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,721
Naruto!

168
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,315
Damn...

169
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,650
You're stupid.

170
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,235
Do you think something
like that will affect it at all?

171
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,362
Do you understand, Isaribi?

172
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,657
I am the only one
who can save you.

173
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,661
Now, finish them off!

174
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,666
What's wrong?

175
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,585
You want to turn back into
a human, don't you?

176
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,757
Then do as I say!

177
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,721
It's no good...

178
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,936
It's no good...

179
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:06,943
I can't let Isaribi...
go to...that world...

180
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,292
This feeling...

181
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:30,109
SEAL

182
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,564
What?! What are these
extraordinary Chakras?

183
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,736
S-Sea Monster!

184
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,593
Isaribi...

185
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,473
I will never let Isaribi
go over there!

186
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,436
What are you...?!

187
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,902
Naruto...?!

188
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,529
He's the same as you.

189
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,491
Same as me...?!

190
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,368
Yes...

191
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,663
The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
who long ago attacked our village,

192
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,832
is sealed inside Naruto.

193
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,543
And there was a time

194
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,087
when everyone in the village
treated him like a monster.

195
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,923
And...

196
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,434
And even so, he works so hard,
everybody approves of him.

197
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,610
I understand painfully enough
how you feel...

198
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,573
But...doing that...
It's not good.

199
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,702
Those words...were true...

200
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,796
Naruto!

201
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,428
You bastard!

202
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,697
The wind blows, Ah...

203
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,534
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

204
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,078
What should be brought along?

205
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,081
Assemble them into a piece.

206
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,043
There is no second chance, never

207
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,754
How foolish it is to throw away

208
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,049
Acting so innocently, Ah...

209
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,676
The images.

210
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,975
It probably will not end

211
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,273
It probably will not end

212
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,028
Burn that love-filled heart,

213
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,156
Sail across a thousand dreams

214
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,075
Running freely

215
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

216
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,957
The clouds scatter

217
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,002
The sun sets yet again

218
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:22,508
The solo parade begins to move.

219
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

220
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,223
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

221
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,067
Oh, I was able to do
the Chief Toad summoning

222
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,610
for the first time in a while!

223
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,279
Now, prepare yourself,
you flabby jerk!

224
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,947
Tomorrow will never come
for you again!

225
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,115
This itches!

226
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,367
What? It's not a good time
to be getting scared now!

227
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,244
It really itches.

228
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,247
Now, Chief Toad,
take him out good.

229
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:57,210
Naruto, summoning me in
salt water like this!

230
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,295
I could take your life for this!

231
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,421
What...?!

232
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,965
Next time: "Battle at Sea:
The Power Unleashed!"
