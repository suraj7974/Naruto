1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,509
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,263
That's right, there's no compromise

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,767
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,562
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,482
That's right, all the way to zero,

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,862
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:33,367
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,455
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,667
It will reach you, without a doubt

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,295
It will come, closer

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,549
Now

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,394
We're speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,687
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,733
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,405
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

16
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,907
If you're not the one

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,576
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,331
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,096
W-What? Where is this place?!

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,098
Restricted Area Do Not Enter

21
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:51,237
This is the site of the second exam,
the 44th Training Field...

22
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,449
Also known as...the Forest of Death.

23
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,412
Forest of...Death?

24
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,710
Huh?

25
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,216
Is that supposed to be...a rock?

26
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,135
Moreover, on top of the grass?

27
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,956
Hey, Konohamaru!
What is it that you want?!

28
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,459
Just what I expect from the man I respect!

29
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,378
Good job on figuring it out!

30
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,850
Hey! Too much gunpowder used!

31
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,481
With an adult sexiness!

32
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,192
I'm Moegi of the senior class
at Kunoichi preschool!

33
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,070
I love factoring! Udon!

34
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,116
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!
Konohamaru!

35
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,745
The three of us together are
the Konohamaru Gang!

36
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,996
Here we are!

37
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,666
What's going on you guys?

38
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,047
Hey, I'm about to take the
second exam for the Chunin Exam.

39
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,300
I have no time to be playing
around with you guys!

40
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,219
We didn't come to play around!

41
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,057
That's right!
We came here for an interview!

42
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,558
That's right

43
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,060
Interview?

44
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,522
Yeah, we were put in charge to write
the feature article for the "Chunin Exam,"

45
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:55,069
0for the academy's class newspaper.

46
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,530
So that's why we came to
interview you, leader

47
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,824
Please cooperate with us.

48
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,618
Please.

49
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,496
But...

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,540
Hey, over there!
What are you doing?!

51
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:15,464
Konohamaru here is asking about
an interview for the class newspaper

52
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:21,845
Oh, I forgot that Lord Hokage was
mentioning something like that.

53
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,430
Hey, hey.

54
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,393
All right, take a 10-minute break
starting now!

55
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,939
For those who will be interviewed,
resign yourselves and be courteous.

56
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,483
Hey, hey. What's this all about?

57
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,902
Big brother Naruto! I'm depending on you.

58
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,904
All right!

59
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:43,283
In that case, I'll just show you
how attractive I am!

60
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,289
Special Report:
Live from the Forest of Death!

61
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,711
Chapter of Character Introduction

62
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,050
Please introduce yourself.

63
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,885
Okay!

64
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,682
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

65
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,851
A Ninja from Village Hidden in the Leaves!

66
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,729
My hobby is to play pranks,
and I love ramen noodles,

67
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,188
I've just become a Genin but.

68
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,067
My dream is big, to become a Hokage!

69
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,071
And I'm going to surpass all
the Hokage from the past,

70
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,533
and make everybody in the town
acknowledge my existence.

71
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:30,039
I've been called a failure and such,

72
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,125
but I graduated splendidly and,

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,128
as a member of Group Seven
led by Kakashi Sensei,

74
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,423
I am dealing with
difficult missions every day!

75
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,133
Distance from the target?

76
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,469
5 meters.

77
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,846
I'm ready anytime.

78
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,767
In Group Seven, there is also
Sasuke and Sakura.

79
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,895
Since I'm really the only one that shows
great success,

80
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,021
you don't worry about the other two.

81
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,981
I got you!

82
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,525
Don't say such things.
Introduce them properly!

83
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,693
Is the target correct?

84
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,445
I know, I know.

85
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,447
The target confirmed.

86
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,868
For example, this guy's name is
Sasuke Uchiha

87
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,411
and he's a pretentious guy.

88
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:13,499
I heard that he's one of the last
remaining of the famous Uchiha clan,

89
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,127
but he really is a pitiful guy, like this.

90
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,929
Oh, this was when I transform but...

91
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,391
as long as you understand the greatness
of my Ninja skills that's all that matters.

92
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,815
Oh, and this is Sakura Haruno
who is in love with me.

93
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,901
You know, the more she denies it,
the more I'm convinced it's true.

94
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,028
She hardly tells me how
she really feels about me but,

95
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,697
her shyness makes her even cuter!

96
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,535
Is that true?

97
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,496
It really is true, true.

98
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,708
Who's in love with Naruto?! Cha!

99
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,045
It was a lie after all!

100
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,923
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,302
Well, putting that aside,
three of us formed a team

102
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,556
and got through a bunch
of dangerous missions together.

103
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,020
Hey you.
What?

104
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,314
Oh, Missus!

105
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,441
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!

106
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,194
What? What's wrong?

107
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:28,031
Those.those aren't weeds.

108
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,825
Huh?

109
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,371
Those are herbs I grew in my garden!

110
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,582
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

111
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,133
Somebody! Help.!

112
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,259
No!

113
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,805
Free Fall!

114
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,185
You idiot.

115
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,604
Trap Field Do Not Enter
Don't go over there!

116
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,859
Hey! Please stop!

117
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,863
That fool.

118
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,700
Geez... All because he
stubbornly chose that big dog.

119
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,037
This is a dangerous mission?

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,665
It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.

121
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,083
Yikes!

122
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,925
Well, there were times like that too.

123
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,345
Do it over.

124
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,764
Transform!

125
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,646
Oh, this was when I defeated
the Old Man Hokage.

126
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,027
This isn't going to make a good article.

127
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,821
Fine, then you show me how to do it.

128
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,616
Fine! My name is Konohamaru.

129
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,410
The grandson of the town's chief Hokage.

130
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,497
Grandfather is the most important figure
in the Leaf Village

131
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,624
and is the third Hokage.

132
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,259
Those who succeed the Hokage name
is the top Ninja of the village.

133
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,929
Especially the 4th Hokage is a great hero
who protected the village

134
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,139
from the demon fox!

135
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,600
Hey, hey, hey wait!

136
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,353
You're only talking about other people!

137
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,400
I was just about to start on myself!

138
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,194
Besides, Bro, you talk too much
about yourself!

139
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,031
Of course, I am the star of the article,
other people don't matter!

140
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,910
You're right, Naruto.

141
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,162
Of course, you're going to forget about me

142
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,206
when you graduate from the academy.

143
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,127
But you can introduce me for a bit.

144
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,629
Oh, yes, yes.

145
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:52,175
He is the first person in the town
who acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei.

146
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,761
He's a really nice person,

147
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,597
he always treats me to
ramen noodles at Ichiraku.

148
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,642
Am I just a nice person because
I treat you to ramen noodles?

149
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,978
Oh no.well.that's.

150
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,480
Don't laugh it off!

151
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,525
Big brother, next up,
I'm depending on you!

152
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,736
Oh, you're right!

153
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,740
Then, I guess I could talk
about Sasuke's stories of failures.

154
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:19,202
I've already heard that one.
Get more serious!

155
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,371
That Naruto.!

156
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,541
I bet he's just making up
stuff as he pleases.

157
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,460
Humph!

158
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,586
Who cares.

159
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,508
Chapter of Ninja Art

160
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,929
Well, now we'll have Sakura Haruno,

161
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,267
who is my senior as a Kunoichi,
teach us about Ninja Art.

162
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,229
Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi,
Sakura Haruno.

163
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,731
Beautiful?

164
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,816
What, you have any complaints?

165
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,401
Oh, no.

166
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:52,903
Transform!

167
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,572
Well first, Naruto's Ninjutsu...

168
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,367
Sexy Jutsu,

169
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,289
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

170
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,917
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

171
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,130
Transform!

172
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,423
- Transform!
- Transform!

173
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,883
- Transform!
- Transform!

174
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,976
Harem Jutsu.

175
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,190
I call it, "Harem Jutsu"!

176
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,025
And something like this.

177
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,110
Hey!

178
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,863
It's his fault that he's late!

179
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,582
Dropping the blackboard eraser.

180
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,294
Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,

181
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,588
who graduated as
the top student at the academy.

182
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,619
You won't get me by attacking straight on.

183
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,000
The most popular one in class, he can
also fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.

184
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,794
Sasuke is awesome!

185
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,099
Your Sasuke introduction
is taking too long.

186
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,434
Naruto, you're so noisy.

187
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,436
Stay quiet.

188
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,562
Horse!

189
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,147
Tiger!

190
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,108
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

191
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,443
What?!

192
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,237
That's not a Jutsu Genin can use.

193
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,364
He couldn't have enough Chakra!

194
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,298
Demon Wind Shuriken Windmill of Shadows.

195
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,387
Shuriken won't work on me.

196
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,855
I'll do it.

197
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,732
C-Could that be.?

198
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,193
Sharingan!

199
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,612
0Is that, the Sharingan.?

200
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,746
If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei's.

201
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,541
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!

202
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,963
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu.
it's some kind of magic either way.

203
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,923
I'll reveal that!

204
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,480
Although you have seen Sasuke
using powerful Jutsu like

205
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,649
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu,
Demon Wind Shuriken,

206
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,529
Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,

207
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,073
the greatest of all is...

208
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,332
the sharp look of his eyes!

209
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,334
Any girl who has been stared
at with those eyes,

210
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,588
will fall in love with him!

211
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,383
Sasuke! Look this way!

212
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,303
You're...annoying.

213
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,309
Well, that cold behavior is also
another attractive quality of Sasuke.

214
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,567
Next is our teacher,
Kakashi Hatake Sensei,

215
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,029
also known as the Copy Ninja Kakashi.

216
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,198
He uses the Sharingan in his eye
to assess the enemy's technique

217
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,784
and copy over a thousand Jutsu techniques.

218
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,588
But he's always late to meet people,
and whenever he has any time

219
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,759
he always reads this questionable book
called Make-Out Paradise,

220
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,844
and he always looks like he
doesn't really care about things.

221
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,138
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:

222
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,935
A Thousand Years of Death!

223
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,567
9̀And the biggest mystery of all
is his face hidden under that mask!

224
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,737
I wonder what he really looks like.

225
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,207
Ninja Art, Summoning,
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!

226
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,185
If you can't use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.

227
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:22,399
That's what happens when
you're closing your eyes in the midst of fog.

228
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,111
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.

229
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,157
On top of all that, why does he
have the Sharingan in his left eye

230
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,618
that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?

231
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,621
One mystery after another when
it comes to this person,

232
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,373
so many things that I don't understand.

233
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,041
I should ask him next time
I have the chance.

234
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,048
Lightning Blade!

235
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,175
What the.?!

236
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,637
His hand is.
visibly overflowing with Chakra!

237
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,392
You are too dangerous.

238
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,313
Water Prison Jutsu.

239
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,773
Oh no!

240
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,861
Secret Jutsu.

241
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,080
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

242
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,917
Next up are the Ninjutsu of
the other Ninjas besides us.

243
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,630
There's such a diverse collection of
Ninjutsu that I have no time to explain all.

244
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:34,387
Chapter of Rivals

245
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,641
Please, Sasuke,
whom I feel is like my future self,

246
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,268
take care of the next part.

247
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,399
Sure. After all, I have be the one
to do something about it.

248
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,028
I knew that from the beginning.

249
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,324
Don't try so hard to look cool.

250
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,075
Sasuke, the snob.

251
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,578
Don't interfere.

252
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,371
Stay out of it, loser.

253
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,040
Annoying.

254
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,416
Shut up!

255
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,503
I hate the fact that only you stand out.

256
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:12,675
Nobody strong around you
shows any interest in you.

257
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,803
What the.?!

258
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,222
Just watch this.

259
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,556
Hey!

260
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,518
You there. What's your name?

261
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:27,565
I'm Gaara of the desert.
I have an interest in you as well.

262
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
What's your name?

263
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,111
Sasuke Uchiha.

264
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,573
Hey, you there. Identify yourself.

265
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:41,037
Dang it! Again? It's always about Sasuke!

266
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,791
When asking someone his name,
give your own name first.

267
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,503
You, with the unpleasant look.

268
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,712
Wait a minute!

269
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,471
Why don't you fight with me here now?

270
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,683
I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow.
Believe it!

271
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,979
The one I want to fight isn't you.
It's Uchiha.

272
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,314
Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke!
It's annoying!

273
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,440
It's true!

274
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,861
Nobody thinks that you're
the main character leader!

275
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,239
That's not true, they're all just blind!

276
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,159
Huh. As usual you're just about
the talk and not the walk.

277
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,578
That's not true!

278
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,705
Leaf Whirlwind!

279
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,668
See, you are just about the talk.

280
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,086
Uhh. even Sakura is picking on me.

281
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,008
The students who gathered for
this Chunin Exam are all skilled,

282
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,136
and are the cream of the crop.

283
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:44,767
Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,
Ino Yamanaka,

284
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,272
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru,

285
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,274
and Shino Aburame.

286
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,278
You won't never be able to win
with the way you have been fighting.

287
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,280
You must understand that, right?

288
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,116
Y-Yeah! Of course!

289
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,243
You, too. Be careful not to let
your guard down

290
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,412
so you won't be defeated by some lame guy!

291
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,247
Huh! Of course!

292
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,295
That's right.

293
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,799
We passed the first stage
of the Chunin Exam and

294
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,010
are heading to the location
of the second stage.

295
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,931
No matter what kind of adversity
may lie ahead,

296
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,642
we will not be afraid!

297
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:30,104
And we will pass the exam
to become a Chunin!

298
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:34,108
Because we...we...

299
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,071
have the greatest teamwork
that was formed by a strong bond!

300
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,114
Okay! Let's go!

301
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:52,293
Thank you so much for cooperating
with the interview!

302
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,504
– Thank you.
– Leader!

303
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,964
Do your best!

304
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,216
Yeah leave it to me!

305
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,176
– Bye!
– See you!

306
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,178
– Do your best!
– Good luck!

307
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,186
Hey, can you hear it?

308
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,191
The clear, blue sky

309
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,444
goes on and on

310
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:26,536
The ocean spans limitlessly

311
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:35,545
Please keep that smile on your face forever

312
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,219
Or else I'll cry

313
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,098
You won't have to search around you

314
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,185
It's all ok now.

315
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,691
Everyone is inside

316
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,986
this hand

317
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:05,116
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

318
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,662
When you forget what happiness is

319
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,916
Just sing.

320
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Light is born, and darkness was born

321
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,049
The two are one

322
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:27,972
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

323
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:33,186
Hey, can you hear it?

324
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:40,610
The 44th Training Field,
also known as the Forest of Death.

325
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,904
From here on it's a serious battle
between the Ninjas,

326
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,572
anything could happen!

327
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,326
It's going down in earnest now!

328
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,162
This is getting interesting!

329
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,539
A life-risking survival game in the forest!

330
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,666
I will survive without fail!

331
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,796
Next time: "The Chunin Exam Stage 2:
The Forest of Death!"

332
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,882
As for me, I'm going to kick butt again!
