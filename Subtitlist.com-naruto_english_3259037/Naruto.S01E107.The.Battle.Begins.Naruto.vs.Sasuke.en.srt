1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,479
Connecting old words
that have been used up

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,817
I just want to convey

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,320
my simple thoughts

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:34,118
That day's faint wind blows away

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,415
at the castle ruins of yesterday

6
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:45,254
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,300
Still that incident

8
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,720
will continue to trouble you, right?

9
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,057
That's why it must be good-bye

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,644
Leaving nothing behind,

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,231
let us share what is left

12
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:10,112
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

13
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:14,658
And sadness will touch our cheeks,

14
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,454
creating a river of tears

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,293
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,131
and melting away

17
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,608
But thank goodness
your injury wasn't serious.

18
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,071
Naruto was relieved, too...

19
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,046
The rumors were true...

20
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,341
That the survivor of the Village's
honorable Uchiha Clan

21
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,468
was the most good-for-nothing kid...

22
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:27,273
Sasuke, you must be hungry.
Is there something you want to eat?

23
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,108
I'll go buy something for you.

24
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,912
The Battle Begins:
Naruto vs. Sasuke

25
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,542
To be honest,
I really don't understand.

26
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,295
It seems there were opinions that,

27
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,714
with the final exam being suspended,

28
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,759
no one should pass
this time around.

29
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:01,807
But I hear the late Third Hokage
highly praised your match.

30
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,436
It seems he intended to recommend you
for Chunin.

31
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,814
The lords of other lands
who observed the fight

32
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,858
and the proctors were of
the same opinion as well...

33
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,321
In that case, it's not in my place
to say this or that about it.

34
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,989
From now on,

35
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,409
strive to perform in a manner
that is worthy of that headband...

36
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,914
Congratulations!
As of today, you're a Chunin!

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,709
– Wow...
– Wow!

38
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:33,839
Even you who's never motivated
look respectable.

39
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,674
It doesn't suit you.

40
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,385
Don't laugh, I say...

41
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,845
For the time being,

42
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,849
let's have a toast to celebrate
Shikamaru's promotion to Chunin!

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,435
Let's eat!

44
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,145
Oh! Choji!

45
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,981
Don't eat the meat before the toast!

46
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,776
But, it'd be a waste if it got burned, so...

47
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,072
There's a lot of meat. Eat up!
All right!

48
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,207
Right now,
I have no interest in you...

49
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,794
Your target is Naruto, after all.

50
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,351
You'll end up in the hospital again, Choji.

51
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,979
Don't you know how to savor the taste?

52
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,439
Never mind!

53
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,942
Even if I eat a lot,
I know how to savor properly.

54
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:25,576
Hey! Choji, that's the last piece of meat
that I've been grilling!

55
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,204
The last bite!
This is the conclusion and

56
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,541
will become the meat with
the greatest value that should be savored!

57
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,880
I won't hand over
this last bite to anyone!

58
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,509
What're you acting cool for,
you idiot?!

59
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,430
Everyone makes fun of you
because you're like this!

60
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,390
– You're just a fa...
– Ino!

61
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,142
That's a taboo word!

62
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,561
But really, Choji...

63
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,521
A meal isn't a battle.

64
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,399
Relax at a time like this at least.
What a pain.

65
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,618
Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed...
Too lazy...

66
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,704
I wonder if these guys
will be okay from here.

67
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,830
In particular...

68
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,793
Choji. With you it's nothing but food.

69
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,170
Do a little training sometime!

70
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,230
Choji...

71
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,359
You're lucky that your mind
doesn't restrict what you eat...

72
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,403
I've got it rough with a diet.

73
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,906
Why do you have to diet, Ino?

74
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:51,870
Girls want to be seen as cute as possible
by the one they like!

75
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,002
But that person might not always
like a thin person.

76
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,380
In the first place,
most boys don't like fa...

77
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,508
Not that... They like thin girls.

78
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,886
And, vice-versa.

79
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,727
You should be a little more conscious
of your body, Choji.

80
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,354
You won't be popular.

81
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,818
Heh... She doesn't get it.

82
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:28,282
Men don't like thin women
as much as women think.

83
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:33,787
More likely men who like chubby women
are the most common.

84
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,000
And, vice-versa...I'd say.

85
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,252
I bet she'd be twice as popular

86
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,298
if she were to gain a little more weight
instead of dieting.

87
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,305
You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.

88
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,515
And you're smart, too.
Hmm?

89
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,976
I know it in my heart...

90
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,689
You're much more awesome
than the likes of Sasuke or Neji.

91
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,281
Well, I've never even thought about that.
I'm me, so...

92
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,284
But you're the only one
who became a Chunin

93
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,329
in the Chunin Exam this time...

94
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,458
But you might be better
at fighting, right?

95
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,295
I might've given up if
I'd gotten into one with you.

96
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,340
But earlier,
Sensei told me that all I do is eat

97
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,342
and that I'm not progressing...

98
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,971
I'm me, I tell you. And you're you.

99
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,225
It's stupid talking about how which is.

100
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:42,773
Well, don't worry too much
about what Asuma says...

101
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,776
You should live naturally
and take things easy.

102
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,113
See you later! I'm going home.

103
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,616
My dad's starting to say
some troublesome thing

104
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,744
like he's going to teach me
a new Jutsu or something.

105
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,247
Shikamaru.
Hmm?

106
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,835
What?

107
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,380
Good luck with your training.

108
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,093
Yeah.

109
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,430
You're a good guy...Choji.

110
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,493
Hey, Sakura!

111
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,497
Naruto!

112
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,964
The time is right...

113
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,968
Head for the Leaf Village, now!

114
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,850
I see... You've made up your mind, huh?
Yes!

115
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,895
I'm carrying out fitness training
to get ready for the surgery.

116
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,357
I want to return as soon as
I can after the surgery, so...

117
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,237
Oww!
Ow-ow...

118
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,705
Lee...
Yes?! What is it?

119
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,168
You won't die
if you give up being a Shinobi.

120
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,343
Why are you so fixated
on being a Shinobi?

121
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:44,311
My everything is proving that
even I can become a fine Ninja...

122
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:50,984
You might die. Even if you succeed...

123
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,986
Even so...

124
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,696
I promise you!

125
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,908
That's my dream, so...

126
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,790
Why...do you snap this much
at the mention of Hokage's name?

127
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,627
Unlike you...

128
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,838
I will be the heir to the name
of Hokage, no matter what!

129
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,675
Because, Hokage is my dream!

130
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,848
In this village, promising children
are being brought up.

131
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:29,564
Sarutobi Sensei... Sure enough,
you were a wonderful Hokage.

132
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,152
The surgery is in the afternoon.
Get ready!

133
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,532
Let's go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
Yes!

134
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,876
I got some apples...
You like them, right?

135
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,837
Here, doesn't it look good?

136
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,426
Huh...? I wonder where I put the knife...

137
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,429
It's right in front of you, believe it.

138
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,850
It's so lame, you getting all scatterbrained
just because you're in front of Sasuke.

139
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,059
I'd rather hear lame
from anyone but you...

140
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,436
Naruto...

141
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,105
U-zu-ma-ki!

142
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,691
Naruto 2K Barrage!

143
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,281
Knock it off already!

144
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,158
Summoning Jutsu!

145
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,787
I will...protect Sakura!

146
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,790
I-I give up, believe it...

147
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,751
Sasuke... Thank you.

148
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,547
You rescued me from
the Sand Ninja, right?

149
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,631
No...

150
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,303
The person who rescued you...
was Naruto.

151
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,574
You are weak.

152
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,788
Why are you weak...?

153
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,208
It's because you don't have enough...

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,335
...hate.

155
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,005
Good. I peeled it nicely.

156
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,508
I'll cut it to make it easy to eat, and...

157
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,885
Here, Sasuke.

158
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,349
Ow! What happened?

159
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,810
S-Sasuke?
Huh? What's going on?

160
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,401
Wh-What?

161
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,613
Y-You don't have to glare
at me like that.

162
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,578
Hey, Naruto...
Wh-What is it?

163
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,540
Fight me... Right now!

164
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,920
What?! Here you are,
just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.

165
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,590
What're you saying?
Just fight!

166
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,386
Sasuke...

167
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,846
You think you saved me?

168
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,558
I don't care if she's the Fifth Hokage
or whatever, but...

169
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,309
she should've just minded
her own business!

170
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,019
What?!

171
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,066
You said you wanted to fight me, right?

172
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,193
I'm saying let's do it now!

173
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,572
Or have you chickened out?

174
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,910
S-Sasuke. Hey...
What's going on?!

175
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,288
Naruto, you say something too!

176
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,372
What's this all of a sudden?

177
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,669
This is perfect, believe it!

178
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,338
I was just thinking
I wanted to fight you!

179
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,800
S-Stop it, the both of you... Okay?

180
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,054
Come with me!

181
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,442
What's...this feeling?
My lower belly feels tight...

182
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,737
I want to fight you, too.

183
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,157
And... I feel a thrill.

184
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,789
What's so funny?

185
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,501
Nothing's funny, believe it!
I'm happy!

186
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,463
When I think
I can finally beat you here!

187
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,301
Abducting Naruto

188
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:13,473
is the No.1 priority
of our organization, Akatsuki.

189
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,394
What did you say?
Don't talk foolish, you failure!

190
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,398
I'm not going to be
a failure forever!

191
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,862
Right now,
I have no interest in you...

192
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,705
You... A loser like you better
not act all high and mighty!

193
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,291
Hah! It's unlike you to lose
your cool and raise a fuss.

194
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,751
So uncharacteristic.

195
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,715
It couldn't be that you picked a fight
and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?

196
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,383
Just bring it, now!

197
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,886
Put on your headband before that!
I'll wait.

198
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,722
I don't need such a thing...

199
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,890
Just do it!

200
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,897
You wouldn't even be able...
to put one knick on my forehead!

201
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,941
You're wrong!

202
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,446
I'm saying this is a testament to fighting
on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!

203
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,159
And I'm saying stuff like that
is acting high and mighty!

204
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,619
Do you think that we're equal?!

205
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:21,875
Yeah, I do! I've never once
thought that I'm inferior to you!

206
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,085
You're an eyesore!

207
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,090
That's because you remain weak!
Little Sasuke!

208
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,050
Naruto!

209
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,011
Sasuke!

210
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,643
Don't be getting carried away!

211
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,285
Naruto...

212
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,000
Enough already, believe it!

213
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,107
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

214
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,684
U-zu-ma-ki!

215
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,028
Naruto Barrage!

216
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,951
The Tiger Seal!

217
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,663
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!

218
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,759
N-Naruto!

219
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,648
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!

220
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,821
Damn it!

221
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,408
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

222
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,079
S-Stop...

223
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,956
I'll win no matter what!

224
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,041
Don't flatter yourself!

225
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,752
Stop it, both of you...

226
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,091
Stop it!

227
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,775
Once in a long while,

228
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,320
once in a while

229
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:25,201
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

230
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:30,248
Look like a mountain

231
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,130
Clinging to the Divine,

232
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,717
clinging to Buddha

233
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,681
The remnants of a person crying

234
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,184
Look like a mountain

235
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,814
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

236
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:59,068
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)

237
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,155
Shake shake shake
Let's look

238
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:06,284
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

239
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:20,673
Look like a mountain

240
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,012
Look like a mountain

241
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,557
Look like a mountain

242
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,770
Look like a mountain

243
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:41,319
After becoming a Three-Man Squad,
though we had fights,

244
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,529
we carried out our missions together.

245
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,908
And yet, both Sasuke and Naruto
have steadily gone on ahead

246
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,244
and only I've been left behind.

247
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:55,750
Say, Sasuke, I feel you at a distance
even though you're this close.

248
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,170
No matter what,
I can't see you, Sasuke.

249
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,965
Next time:
"Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds"
