1
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,553
C'mon!

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,353
Running like a fugitive,

3
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,231
Being chased by something

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,277
Inside my heart is pounding

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,656
My throat dry like it's withering

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,995
For no single one,

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,707
To none does belong,

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,129
This time is ours, right now...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,883
Unraveling the pain,

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,885
Unraveling our hearts,

11
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,387
Unraveling shadows

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,766
Stifling our breath,

13
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,601
Reaching for beyond,

14
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,895
Tearing through the dark

15
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:09,695
In fighting and in love

16
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,491
To the distant light above,

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,411
Yes, we are on the way

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,918
I wanna rock...

19
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,379
Rockin' my heart

20
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,860
I think we almost finished
shaking off the losers.

21
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,363
Then I guess I'll move
onto the main issue.

22
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,783
It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.

23
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,327
All right!

24
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,705
Here is the tenth question!

25
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,959
Here it comes!

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,087
I have to put everything on
the line for this question!

27
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,467
The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!

28
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,766
Making such a big deal.

29
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,061
This is the final obstacle.

30
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,814
Kankuro, come back already!

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,609
If he starts the tenth question,
your cheat sheet has no meaning!

32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,655
But before that,

33
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,119
I'm going to add
some rules for the last question.

34
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,173
Aren't you lucky?

35
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,929
It looks like playing with
the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?

36
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,598
This guy.

37
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,766
He's figured Crow out!

38
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,728
Anyway, sit down.

39
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,829
Let me explain!

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,831
These are

41
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,668
the hopeless rules!

42
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,633
Well, anyhow.

43
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,261
There's nothing to do when
the subordinates are gone, huh?

44
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:43,474
Well, it'll get busy soon enough.

45
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,600
Why?

46
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,021
This year's first proctor...

47
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,690
I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.

48
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,779
Well then, passing the first exam
already seems iffy.

49
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,450
Of all the people, that sadist...

50
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,243
Sadist?

51
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:09,166
Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,
so you wouldn't know.

52
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,128
Who is this person?

53
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,632
He is a pro, a professional.

54
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,593
Professional? Of what?

55
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,519
Torture and interrogation.

56
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,020
What?!

57
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,401
Well, there maybe no physical torture
in the exam itself,

58
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,486
but he's sure to use his
his skills as an interrogator

59
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,865
to torment them psychologically.

60
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,451
That is...

61
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:50,374
Leaf Village Anbu's
Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,

62
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,626
Ibiki Morino!

63
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,550
Hopeless rules...?!

64
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,303
First, you guys will have to choose

65
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:08,225
whether or not you will take
this 10th question!

66
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,440
Choose whether or not to take the exam?

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,442
What, choose?!

68
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,403
What happens if you choose not
to take the 10th exam?

69
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:25,492
If you chose not to take the exam,
then your score will be zero.

70
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,871
In other words, you fail!

71
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,166
And of course, the same goes for
the two others in the same group!

72
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,667
W-What does that mean!

73
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,754
Of course, everybody is going to
choose to take the exam!

74
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,131
This is ridiculous!
As if we have a choice!

75
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,343
And...one more rule...

76
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,847
Another one?! Finish with it already!

77
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:51,602
If you chose to take it and
are unable to answer it correctly,

78
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,520
then you will have to...

79
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:59,276
relinquish your right
of taking the Chunin Exam forever.

80
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,740
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!

81
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,451
Besides, there are plenty of people here

82
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,912
who have taken the Chunin Exam many times!

83
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,923
You're just unlucky.

84
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,010
I make the rule this year.

85
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,474
But I did give you the option to go back!

86
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,396
For those of you who aren't confident,
you can choose not to take it

87
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,608
and take the exam
next year or the year after that.

88
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,822
Oh! How terrible!

89
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,408
If one out of the three
chooses not to take the exam,

90
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,828
then all three will be failed.

91
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,457
If you do choose to take it,
but get the wrong answer...

92
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,960
then that person will be a
Genin for the rest of their life!

93
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,712
No matter what, the odds are against us!

94
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,841
It's an impossible choice
for anyone with normal nerves!

95
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,514
Then, let's begin...

96
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,976
The 10th question...

97
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,979
Those who will not be taking it,
raise your hands!

98
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,191
Once I confirm your number,
I'll ask you to leave!

99
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,701
What kind of a question
is it going to be...?

100
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,994
Darn!

101
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,413
If I get it wrong,
I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.

102
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,914
I don't want that!

103
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,625
But if I choose not take it...!

104
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,379
then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!
I don't want that either!

105
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,549
I won't raise my hand!

106
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,386
I'm confident that
I can answer it correctly.

107
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,346
But...

108
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,225
But Naruto! You're different!

109
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,021
You should retreat this time
even if it means to ignore us

110
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,398
and think of your next chance
to take the Exam!

111
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,777
I...

112
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,614
I...

113
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,701
I'm quitting! I'm not going to take it!

114
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,704
#50 failed!

115
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:21,168
#130, #111 will be failed as well...

116
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,130
I-I'm sorry... Gennai! Inaho!

117
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,177
Darn...

118
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,511
M-Me too!

119
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,390
Me too!

120
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,361
Naruto...

121
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,822
Why don't you raise your hand?

122
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,746
That guy...

123
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,665
I am the super elite ninja

124
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,458
who will be carrying
the name of the Hokage!

125
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,587
My name is Naruto Uzumaki, remember that!

126
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,131
Shut up!

127
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,344
I'm prepared to do anything
to become a Hokage!

128
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,429
I will surpass the Hokage!

129
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,099
And I will make all of
the people in the village

130
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,810
acknowledge my presence!

131
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,024
He's always got such a one-track mind.

132
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,778
Saying Hokage, Hokage
all the time like a fool.

133
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,658
I'm sorry, Naruto.

134
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,743
It seems like...

135
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,288
I don't want to...

136
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,042
crush your unachievable dreams.

137
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,707
That guy...

138
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,671
Ibiki completely understands how
the human psyche works.

139
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,675
And the most horrifying part is...

140
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,056
that by cornering people psychologically
he controls their psyche and

141
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,145
reveals the fundamental
weakness of a human.

142
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,116
Don't underestimate me! I won't run!

143
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,078
I'll take it!

144
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,830
But even if I'm stuck being
a Genin forever,

145
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,793
I will become a Hokage
no matter what it takes!

146
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,382
I'm not scared!

147
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,851
That guy, he wasn't even
thinking of us at all.

148
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,020
Such audacity!

149
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,563
That's right...

150
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,483
That's exactly the kind of fool you are!

151
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,820
I'll ask again.

152
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,074
It's a choice that will alter your life.

153
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,410
If you want to quit, now is your chance!

154
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,704
I'm not going to take back my words!

155
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,373
That is my Way of Ninja!

156
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,718
What a funny kid.

157
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,514
He completely brushed away
those kids' anxieties.

158
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:09,312
78, huh? Much more left than I expected.

159
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,275
It's going to be the same.
No matter how much more I push it.

160
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,701
I like your determination!

161
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,703
Then...

162
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,664
For those who are still here...

163
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,584
The first exam...

164
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,338
You have passed it!

165
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
Huh?

166
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,516
H-Hey, what does that mean?

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,351
All of a sudden you're telling us
that we've passed!

168
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
What about the 10th question?

169
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,525
There wasn't such a thing to begin with!

170
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,987
Well, you can look at the choice you
just had to make as the 10th question!

171
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,197
What?!

172
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,281
Hey!

173
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,910
Then, what were all
those nine questions for!

174
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,161
It was just a waste of time!

175
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,371
Not a waste...

176
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,918
The objective of the nine questions
were already accomplished.

177
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:19,674
To test your individual ability
to gather information!

178
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,512
Ability to gather information?

179
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,096
First...

180
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,265
The focus of this test was

181
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,267
on the system of determining
the pass or failure

182
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:34,314
based on the three-person groups
that was proposed in the first rule.

183
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,107
By grading the exam on a group basis,

184
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:42,447
I added the unimaginable pressure
of dragging down your teammates.

185
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,824
I see, I see.

186
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,703
I kind of felt that was
the point of this test!

187
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,372
No, you didn't!

188
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,167
However...

189
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,253
The questions on these tests weren't
things that

190
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,881
you Genin Ninja would
have been able to solve...

191
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,801
So in that case...

192
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,763
I imagined that most of you here
would have come to this conclusion:

193
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,766
"In order to score points,
I'll have to cheat."

194
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,476
In other words,

195
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,105
this exam was created under the premise
that you all would cheat!

196
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,910
That being said,

197
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,746
I had two Chunin in the group
who knew all of the answers

198
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,292
from whom you could cheat.

199
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,753
What?! That's what it was?

200
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,256
I had a hard time figuring out the guy.

201
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,341
Yeah. Really...

202
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,220
It was so obvious!

203
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,556
There's something wrong with you
if you didn't notice!

204
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,641
Right, Hinata?!

205
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,645
He...didn't realize it...

206
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,314
However...

207
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,611
those who just foolishly cheated,
naturally were disqualified.

208
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,572
That's because...

209
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,992
Information, depending on
the time and situation,

210
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,578
it will be more valuable than life.

211
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,580
And in a mission or on a battlefield,

212
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,543
you will always have to risk your life
to fight for it!

213
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:24,966
Horrible burn marks, nail punctures
and scratches...

214
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,509
Those are signs of physical torture!

215
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,183
When information is gathered

216
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,810
and the enemy or a third party
finds out about it,

217
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,022
that information is no longer
guaranteed to be correct.

218
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,693
Just remember this.

219
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,864
To be given the wrong information

220
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,993
can bring a catastrophic blow
to your friends and town.

221
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,997
So that is why, out of necessity,
we forced you guys to cheat

222
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,000
in order to test your ability
to collect information.

223
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:05,006
And we filtered out those who
were clearly lacking in those abilities.

224
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,508
But...

225
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,969
The last question doesn't make any sense.

226
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,346
However...

227
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,685
this 10th question was
the main issue of this first exam.

228
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,188
What do you mean?

229
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,273
I'll explain.

230
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:26,653
The tenth question was to
take on the question, or not.

231
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:31,866
Needless to say, it is
a painful decision to make.

232
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,827
Those who chose not to
take on the question,

233
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,496
would be immediately failed
along with their whole squad!

234
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,875
Those who chose to answer
the question and got it wrong...

235
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,046
would be robbed of their chance
to take the Exam forever.

236
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,425
It really is an unfair question.

237
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,347
Then, how about these two choices?

238
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,017
Let's say that you guys did
become a Chunin.

239
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,771
The mission is to steal a secret document!

240
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,607
You have no idea how many
Ninjas the enemy has,

241
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,736
their ability, and other armament
they may have.

242
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:13,450
On top of that, there maybe
the pitfall of an enemy trap.

243
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,746
Now this mission...
Will you take it? Or not take it?

244
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,955
Because you want your life spared...

245
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,708
Because your partners will
be put in danger...

246
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,128
Can you get away from dangerous missions?

247
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,297
The answer is...

248
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,009
No!

249
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,429
There are going to be missions
you cannot avoid

250
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,639
no matter how risky or
dangerous it may be!

251
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,061
Showing your courage to
your teammates in a tight spot,

252
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,981
and the ability to get through
the hardships...

253
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,946
This is the quality that is needed
in a Chunin troop leader!

254
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:01,122
In a pinch, there are
those who cannot risk their own fate,

255
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,168
and those who waver and give up
their chances

256
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,714
because they think they
will have another chance.

257
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,718
I believe that such fools who don't have
strong determination

258
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:18,389
have no right to become a Chunin!

259
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,267
For those of you who chose
to take on the question,

260
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,854
you can say that you have successfully
answered the difficult 10th question!

261
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,818
You shall be able to take on
the adversity that may lie in your way.

262
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,404
You've passed through the gates!

263
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,034
The fist exam for the Chunin Exam
has been completed.

264
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,788
I wish you well!

265
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,290
All right! Wish us well!

266
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,252
I did it! I did it! Yeaah!

267
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,214
What a funny guy...

268
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,184
W-What's going on?!

269
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,649
Gosh, this one...

270
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,109
You guys!

271
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,028
This isn't the time to be celebrating!

272
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:19,117
I'm the proctor for the second exam!
Anko Mitarashi!

273
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,494
Let's move onto the next stage! Next!

274
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,956
Follow me!

275
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,422
Read the atmosphere.

276
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,429
This proctor... Is kind of like Naruto.

277
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,976
78?! Ibiki! You let 26 teams slide by?

278
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,938
I guess, the first exam this time around
was too easy.

279
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,901
It seems like this time,
there are a lot of excellent candidates.

280
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,404
Huh! Well, all right...

281
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,617
I'll drop more than half of them
in the second exam!

282
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,078
M-More than half?

283
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,540
I'm getting excited.

284
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,250
I'll give you the details tomorrow.

285
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,127
We'll be changing locations,

286
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,049
so get information from your Jonin
about the location and the time!

287
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,051
That's it. You're dismissed.

288
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:42,033
I didn't think that there would be a guy
that would pass with a blank sheet.

289
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:46,579
Naruto Uzumaki...
He really is a funny guy.

290
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,711
W-What is this place?!

291
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,672
NO TRESPASSING

292
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,099
This is the location for
the "second exam",

293
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,060
the 44th Training Field.

294
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,064
Also known as...the Forest of Death.

295
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,819
The Forest of...Death?!

296
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,248
I passed the first exam!

297
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,085
I'm just going to hop, jump
and take a big step and...

298
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,629
Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?

299
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,340
Hey, you guys!
if you want to play a Ninja game...

300
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:08,054
No? What? You came here for a mission?!

301
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:14,018
Next episode: "Special Report:
Live from the Forest of Death!"

302
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,270
As for me, I'm going to kick-butt again!
