1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,674
Hey boys,

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:16,350
listen up!

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:20,938
Humans aren't such a big deal

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,818
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,447
so don't hide your fists

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:35,953
You're not old enough

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,915
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,754
Hey boys, you're the only ones

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,965
who can pull the trigger in your heart

10
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,261
All the kids said

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,638
We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,393
awesome world right at this moment,

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,479
All the kids said

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,818
Don't forget every truth or lie

15
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,322
All the kids said

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,616
We're way too young to die

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,579
In this empty town lined with empty faces

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,748
All the kids took off

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,250
into this windless night

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,296
Because they want to change something

21
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:36,430
Blaze Away, Byakugan!
This is My Ninja Way!!

22
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,019
Kiba!

23
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,148
Naruto!

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,984
This isn't good.

25
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,112
Oh my, what's wrong?

26
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,406
So you'll just stay there
and become larvae food?

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,908
Queen Bee...

28
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,251
That kind of stuff shouldn't
be effective, should it?!

29
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,060
Chakra...!

30
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,480
Byakugan!

31
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,995
It's no good... There's no way
I can make it in time!

32
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,664
Naruto...

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,376
I don't know when to give up!

34
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,380
That's right...

35
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:56,302
I know that Naruto would never give up,
no matter what the situation is!

36
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,915
Hey, did you catch them?

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,626
What a foolish group!

38
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,128
They made this creature mad...

39
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,589
And they all got bound in wax!

40
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,383
Bees make wax.

41
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,470
You're an insect handler
and you don't know that?

42
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,932
He's right!
C'mon, are you really an insect handler?

43
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,893
What about the Bikochu?

44
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,977
Nothing.

45
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,605
We did an all-out mobilization
and searched,

46
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,856
but we haven't found it.

47
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,525
Aren't these guys carrying it?

48
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,569
That's unthinkable.

49
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,030
So that means...

50
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:02,034
So we're going to have to
ask one of these guys, after all.

51
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,869
Who's gonna talk?!

52
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,039
We can tell you.
Shino!

53
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,251
However...
It's in exchange for Hinata.

54
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,172
That's stupid, isn't it? To bargain...

55
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,425
Do you not understand your position?

56
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,012
You guys definitely will not
find the Bikochu.

57
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,266
And you're pressed for time.

58
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,980
You are the ones...who will regret it.

59
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,942
What should we do?

60
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,276
If things stay like this,

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,529
the Bikochu won't be of any help
even if it hatches.

62
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,699
In that case, our mission is also...

63
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:44,827
But...

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,871
If we can get rid of even one
of the Aburame family...

65
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,214
Hinata...

66
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,133
Are you worried?

67
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,510
Of course!

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,597
She's strong.
Huh?

69
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,812
Much more...than you think.

70
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,445
I concede. We have a deal.

71
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,197
First of all, we need our friend.

72
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,346
What happened?

73
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,600
The brat...isn't here.

74
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,437
The wax she was trapped in isn't there...

75
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,399
She may have been swept out
to the waterfall.

76
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,525
Jibachi!

77
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:04,198
It can't be helped! I warned her not
to make a bad move or she'd die.

78
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,783
You!

79
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,119
What did you do to Hinata?!

80
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,039
What happened to Hinata! Hey!

81
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,375
Shut up, kid.

82
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,254
The kid's probably in
the depths of hell about now.

83
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,340
Damn you!

84
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,803
Aha, the girl's your girlfriend?

85
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:31,642
You...! I absolutely will not forgive you!

86
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,814
You're kidding me.
What can you do looking like that?

87
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,568
Without Hinata you'll never get
your hands on the Bikochu either.

88
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,738
You are right...

89
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,491
That girl's death was not part
of the plan,

90
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,744
but in the end, it's a good thing.

91
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:57,835
Because...we'll take your lives in return.

92
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,505
From the very beginning, people from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and

93
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,425
from my own Village Hidden in the Stones
have been sworn enemies.

94
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,636
It's natural that we kill
each other, isn't it?

95
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,018
What're ya gonna do, little guy?

96
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,563
Die like this?

97
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,733
Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is,

98
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,362
I could save you for now.

99
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,662
– All right.
– Don't you dare tell them!

100
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:39,376
Those jerks,
I'm going to blow them away!

101
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,131
Shut up, brat!

102
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,479
– Jibachi?
– Hey!

103
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,442
Shut up, I've got to kill him!

104
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,160
It's a Paper Bomb!

105
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,469
You're...!

106
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,350
Y-You're...!
...still alive!

107
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:58,538
That was really close.
But I didn't give up, just like Naruto...

108
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,377
Did she escape from the wax?
It can't be!

109
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,337
These are not ordinary kids.

110
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,802
Leave it to me!

111
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,345
Hinata!

112
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,808
I've never used that in an actual fight...

113
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,311
But I have to do it here, now!

114
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,273
Bee Bombs Jutsu!

115
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,733
1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!

116
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,236
Bee Swarm Jutsu!

117
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,244
Naruto...

118
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,372
Naruto... Watch me.

119
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,010
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!

120
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,055
– What?!
– What?!

121
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,149
You're kidding, right?

122
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,527
That Hinata can do
such an amazing Jutsu?

123
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,572
The Hinata that you know, Naruto,
is from when?

124
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,157
What do you mean?

125
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,370
You've learned new Jutsu
since the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven't you?

126
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,499
Hinata has been steadily developing, too.

127
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,671
She always has been concerned...

128
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,011
Take aim.

129
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,267
That's nice, the three of you,

130
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,770
all have something you're good at
and something you like.

131
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,522
Hinata, you should find something, too...

132
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,192
You're right.

133
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,985
By the way, what is it?

134
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,988
You had some business with me,
didn't you?

135
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,159
Yeah...

136
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,081
I want you to join me
in my training.

137
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:10,337
Hinata was fretting over
what she could do...

138
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,713
What she should do...

139
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,057
Hinata!

140
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,600
Hey, I don't think that we should...

141
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,395
No... Don't go easy on me!

142
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,191
If you're doing it for me...

143
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,735
Do it seriously!

144
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,405
I've got it!

145
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,373
During the harsh training,

146
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:52,254
Hinata discovered her own styles...
and her own special Jutsu.

147
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,217
That's the result of her training.

148
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,435
Huh? You, why!?

149
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,978
I'll tell you something...

150
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,107
Angering the Queen Bee,
getting encased in wax,

151
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,900
it was all part of the strategy.

152
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,029
With our Chakra being sucked
and being immobilized,

153
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,409
it was the only way to protect ourselves
from the larvae...

154
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:29,791
And, do you think I was doing nothing
while I was captured?

155
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:36,173
I was ordering my bugs.
The wax we're wrapped in is very weak.

156
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,848
Shino!

157
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,517
Because of her hard training,

158
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,771
Hinata's Chakra control
has dramatically improved.

159
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,318
That Jutsu is what she developed
from the training...

160
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,778
Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!

161
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:07,579
Hinata's already flexible body combined
with fine-tuned Chakra control

162
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,083
could completely defend
an attack from every direction...

163
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,046
Truly, it's an ultimate defense Jutsu.

164
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,342
Yet it's different from
Neji's 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.

165
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,927
It's Hinata's own Jutsu...

166
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,515
She finally worked that out on her own.

167
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,977
She probably did it because she wanted
to be acknowledged by her father.

168
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,648
To be acknowledged by everyone...

169
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,863
And to be acknowledged by you.

170
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,210
Our Jutsu isn't effective at all?!

171
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,128
What the hell is going on?

172
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,755
What a girl!

173
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,551
Hey, what happened to those guys?!
When did they?!

174
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,558
Summoning Jutsu!

175
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,691
Blow them away!

176
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,498
Hinata!

177
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,250
Shino!

178
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,879
Believe...in her.

179
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,303
Make the Chakra...

180
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,600
sharper, stronger...

181
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,935
bigger, more flexible...

182
00:14:55,604 --> 00:15:01,985
more...more...more...
more...more...more...more!

183
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,960
Hinata!

184
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,754
Hinata!

185
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,883
Naruto...

186
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,890
Hinata, that's an awesome Jutsu!
You're really awesome!

187
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,477
Naruto...!

188
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,983
Let's hurry. It'll be dawn soon.

189
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,193
– Okay!
– Yeah!

190
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,501
Oh, it's becoming a pupa already?

191
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,338
If we make it smell Sasuke's scent
at the moment it hatches,

192
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,799
the mission is complete.
Right!

193
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,639
Sasuke... Wait for me!

194
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,183
No way!

195
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,769
Inside the tree, huh.

196
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,189
If it was there,
the bees should have found it...

197
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,233
You can still move?

198
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:29,656
This insect cage was coated
with secret Aburame family insect repellent.

199
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,574
Wh-What?

200
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,620
The bees won't come close
because of the repellent.

201
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,875
As long as you're using bees to search...
you definitely won't find it.

202
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,757
I expected as much.

203
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,135
I think as long as your clan exists...

204
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:55,098
my clan maybe destined to
be ruined some day.

205
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,894
But!

206
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:07,694
I absolutely will not let you
succeed at your mission!

207
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,323
Even if it kills me, that Bikochu...

208
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,576
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

209
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:21,624
This is our hope...
in order to get our friend back!

210
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,210
I won't let you do that!

211
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,004
Shut up!

212
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,508
Rasengan!

213
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,523
Hey, look...

214
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,403
The pupa is hatching!

215
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,113
Okay!

216
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,823
Huh? It's gone!

217
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,201
You had it 'til just a minute ago!

218
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,995
Hey, search for it, hurry!
R-Right...

219
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,916
Byakugan!

220
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,878
Naruto! Over there.

221
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,468
You blew it away the instant you set off
the Rasengan!

222
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,595
Hurry!
I know!

223
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,056
C'mon, c'mon.

224
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,601
It's going to hatch!

225
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,372
We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this...

226
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,303
Wh-Why...?!

227
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:01,516
That thing just now doesn't count!
C'mon, sniff Sasuke's smell!

228
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,268
It's all over now.
Huh...?

229
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,609
Hey! Stop! Wait!

230
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,322
So you failed because you farted!

231
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,866
Take responsibility!

232
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,286
What are you saying that for?!

233
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,460
Well then...

234
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,675
That's...the Bikochu, isn't it?

235
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:43,808
Naruto... I found you!

236
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,355
C'mon, forgive me already, Sakura!

237
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,983
No! I absolutely will not forgive you!

238
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:56,237
– Sakura, you look so scary!
– Come back here!

239
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,239
So the mission failed...

240
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,743
It seems that they succeeded
at protecting the Bikochu,

241
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,705
but failed at getting it to smell
the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.

242
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,792
I see... Hinata must be depressed.

243
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,630
This strategy was her idea, wasn't it?

244
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,257
Well... Looks like that's not the case.

245
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,681
Hinata... I heard that your mission failed.

246
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,351
Yes. It didn't work at all.

247
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:31,105
I have to train more and more...
and work harder next time!

248
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,567
I-I see... Good luck.

249
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:48,957
More...

250
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,335
More...

251
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,337
More...

252
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,924
More!

253
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,237
Crappy news pass us by

254
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,823
And you become speechless

255
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,621
My voice is way too soft

256
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,083
So you don't answer

257
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,505
You're crying Crying alone

258
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:42,593
What can I do? I'm crying too

259
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,887
"Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night"

260
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll thrash this confused era
with my speed

261
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,272
Yeah

262
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:59,986
And I'll thrash this confused night
with my speed

263
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,740
Yeah

264
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:09,412
I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed

265
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,124
Yeah

266
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:18,838
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I'll kick their butt

267
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:24,761
Yeah

268
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,818
What! Why do I have to go on
such an easy mission?!

269
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:45,281
Don't complain! You're the one
who picked up this mission's client!

270
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,951
That's no reason!
After all, I'm busy with a lot stuff!

271
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,954
That's enough,
or I'll send you back to the Academy!

272
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,706
That's not fair...

273
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,126
No arguments!
Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!

274
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,462
The four of you,
I'm delivering your new mission.

275
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,965
