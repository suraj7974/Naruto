1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,855
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,818
I'll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,320
I've made my decision,

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,990
even if there's a long way to go
on that road.

5
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,619
I'll continue towards the future I've planned

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,541
Time rushes us

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,463
The heartbeat speeds up

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:50,676
When I woke in the middle of a dream

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,889
I kept searching for that same light

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,644
Under the shining star-lit sky with

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,649
countless constellations and shadows

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,613
There was something beyond that...

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,075
What were you gazing at?

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,206
What were you gazing at?

15
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:40,160
Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name

16
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,859
Shizune!

17
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,986
Is anything wrong?!

18
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,542
What is it...?

19
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,378
It's a protection commission
from the Village Hidden in the Stars.

20
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,506
Is there some kind
of problem with that?

21
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,926
You've never heard about it, Shizune?

22
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,679
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is small in terms of scale,

23
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,266
but they are very proud and
have often caused trouble...

24
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,810
So, will you accept?

25
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,980
I can't simply disregard it.

26
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,315
What...?

27
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,985
Since you-know-what
is in that village.

28
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,043
And it seems they'll form
a three-man team

29
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,920
with Neji as the squad leader.

30
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,758
But the Village Hidden in the Stars
is a Shinobi village, isn't it?

31
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,844
Then they should do
their own protecting

32
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,554
without asking others.

33
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,308
There are often instances
of a small village

34
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,061
with friendly relations
seeking cooperation.

35
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,855
In particular, that village is small

36
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,608
and it seems there aren't
that many Shinobi.

37
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,113
No kidding. But why's a place
like that being targeted?

38
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,533
Actually...!

39
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,411
It all happened 200 years ago.

40
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,753
A star fell in the village!

41
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,175
Those stars like in the sky,
not ninja stars or something?!

42
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,013
Right! It seems
there's a mysterious power in the star

43
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,597
that has an effect on Chakra!

44
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,519
That's a superstition!

45
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,856
In the first place, no way has
a star ever come falling down!

46
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,108
It's true!

47
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,485
It's actually been targeted
several times until now

48
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,070
by Shinobi of other lands.

49
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,948
By Shinobi of other lands?

50
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,368
Mysterious power, huh?

51
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,955
Indeed, it does seem that someone
like Orochimaru would target it...

52
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,293
All right, I guess I'll be participating
in this one too!

53
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,588
What?! But the three-man team's
already been determined.

54
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,548
I've got an ace up my sleeve...

55
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,011
Amaguriama Sweet Shop

56
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,936
Listen up. I'll take the lead from here.

57
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,147
There's danger before
entering the village.

58
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,565
Okay, got it!

59
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,275
Hi, guys!

60
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,195
I'll go on ahead and be waiting!

61
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,446
Naruto! Hold it!

62
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,281
That idiot!

63
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,159
Umm, what's Naruto doing
in a place like this?

64
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,619
Like I know.

65
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,829
Lady Tsunade, there was a report

66
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,040
that Naruto has joined up
with Neji's squad.

67
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,793
Yes. I added him to
the Village Hidden in the Stars mission.

68
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,877
Why...?!

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,005
Those four proved themselves
in the Katabami Gold Mine...

70
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,632
and things will quiet down
in the village here, too.

71
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,385
You'd change an already determined
three-man squad just for that reason?!

72
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,930
Lady Tsunade?!

73
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,437
Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly
with gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?

74
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,441
Could it be that was from Naruto...?
70.0101:06:50:2901:06:52:26Tea! Hurry!

75
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,796
Mizura!

76
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,881
You okay?!

77
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,215
I'm fine...

78
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,968
I told you not to push yourself!

79
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:52,264
But, I don't want to fall behind
everyone's training...

80
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,226
What're you doing
during your training?!

81
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,937
Mizura suddenly keeled
over in pain...

82
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,606
Take him to the medical treatment room.

83
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,857
Yes sir.

84
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,941
I'll go, too.

85
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,194
Hokuto by herself is
enough for an escort.

86
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,406
Sumaru, you have a mission.

87
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,457
All right! I'm here first!

88
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,628
Once I cross this valley,
I'll be in the Land of Bears.

89
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,421
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is close.

90
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,970
Wha...?!

91
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,705
You little...!

92
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,791
Ninja Art: Kujaku...

93
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,751
Protection!

94
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,088
This guy blocked Kunai knives
with Chakra!

95
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,756
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

96
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:12,928
Cut!

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,641
Damn it!

98
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,648
Incredible Chakra!

99
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,664
Wait!

100
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,042
This guy's an enemy...
He suddenly attacked!

101
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,923
You're Leaf Shinobi, right?

102
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,805
Are you from
the Village Hidden in the Stars?

103
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,517
I'm Sumaru.
I came to pick you guys up.

104
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,519
Then why did you do such a thing...?

105
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,563
Look at that.

106
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,319
Huh?

107
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,467
The border of the Land of Bears
is constantly filled with poison gas.

108
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,552
It's also serves as
a natural fortress

109
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,679
against invasion from other lands.

110
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,599
So this is the danger
you were talking about, huh?

111
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,312
Isn't that great, Naruto?
You owe Sumaru your life!

112
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,731
It's the beginning of
a beautiful friendship

113
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,399
between the Leaf
and the Hidden Star Village.

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,320
Give me a break.

115
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,405
Was it none of my concern?

116
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,241
I could have just watched
and not done anything...

117
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,018
I am Akahoshi

118
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,562
and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage
of the Village Hidden in the Stars.

119
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,564
Deputy...Hoshikage?

120
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,569
Due to the sudden passing
of the Third Hoshikage one year ago,

121
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,988
presently there is
no Hoshikage in this village...

122
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,117
But, I heard the only ones who can
refer to themselves as a Kage

123
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
are the leaders of
the Five Great Hidden Villages...

124
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,830
That doesn't make any difference!

125
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,375
We are not inferior to you guys!

126
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,838
Even if we're small now,
this village will someday rival

127
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,006
the Hidden Villages of
the Five Great Nations!

128
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,843
At that time,
I'll become the true Hoshikage!

129
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,762
Silence!

130
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,267
Go back to the training ground.

131
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,481
H-Hey, wait up!

132
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,566
Oh! Naruto!

133
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,984
Naruto!

134
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,653
Now of all times!

135
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,324
Don't worry about him.
Please continue your story.

136
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,703
Forgive me.

137
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,123
As you say, the Shinobi in our village
are not qualified

138
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,125
to refer to themselves as a Kage.

139
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,171
However, in this village,
there is the star

140
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,256
that all the Kage in the Five
Great Hidden Villages also envy.

141
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,717
We will use the power
of the star and someday,

142
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,761
this can become a village which can
claim the Sixth Kage title.

143
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,056
So that star is being targeted, right?

144
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,769
Yes. Our search team
obtained some information.

145
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,816
Where'd that guy go?

146
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,334
Hey!

147
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,088
I finally caught up.
Was your name Omaru?

148
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,008
Not Omaru, Sumaru.

149
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,552
Oh, sorry, sorry.

150
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,388
But Sumaru's sure
an interesting name.

151
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,017
It's another name for
the star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.

152
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,313
Everyone in this village has
a name associated with stars.

153
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,524
After all, this is a village
where a star fell.

154
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,150
I see...

155
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,029
What're you trying to elicit from me?

156
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,949
What? Nothing in particular.

157
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,160
I hadn't thanked you for earlier, so.

158
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,329
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround...

159
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,999
The people from other lands
are all after the star.

160
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,544
If you have that power,

161
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,629
you can stand above all
of the Hidden Villages, so...

162
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,591
Is your awesome Chakra
also the power of the star?

163
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,845
If they had that star,

164
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,806
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?

165
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,101
No! The more tremendous the power,

166
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,936
the more hard work is required
to control it!

167
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,314
I'll work hard, work hard, work hard!

168
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,275
I'll become the Hoshikage!

169
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,944
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!

170
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,112
Huh...?

171
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,906
I'm also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!

172
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,743
You're a strange guy.

173
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,453
Really?

174
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,140
Intruder!

175
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,725
Protect the star!

176
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,985
But they really are collapsed entirely
from the center towards the outside.

177
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,822
When a star explodes in mid-air,
it seems they collapse like this.

178
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,409
That's the training area
where the star is enshrined.

179
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,289
Hurry up and show me the star.

180
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,251
No. People from other lands
aren't allowed beyond this spot.

181
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,921
But the star is over there, right?

182
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,549
I can't protect it
if I can't get close to it!

183
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,469
It's not like we trust you guys.

184
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,972
Geez, you're such a suspicious guy!

185
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,476
Why can't you trust us
who came here on a mission?!

186
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,145
This is my personality, you see.

187
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,820
It can't be?! No way.

188
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,822
I'll chase him down!

189
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,199
You go to your friends
in the training area.

190
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,160
Hurry!

191
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,414
Right. Okay.

192
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,633
Hokuto!

193
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,729
Sumaru... I'm sorry.

194
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,313
We couldn't protect the star...

195
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:09,946
You little!

196
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,370
It's ridiculous to do something
like steal in someone else's village

197
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,539
in broad daylight, you little thief!

198
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,211
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

199
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,677
Now, I won't let you getaway!

200
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,017
Ninja Art: Kujaku...

201
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,233
This Chakra?!

202
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,778
Beast!

203
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,662
Uh, oh! Move away!

204
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,961
Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu
towards that monster!

205
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,971
It's futile!

206
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,727
This is my real target!

207
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,938
I found your weak point.

208
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,650
The main body doesn't move
while controlling the Chakra!

209
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,611
Let's go! Clone Body Slam!

210
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,369
There are more ways to
use my Chakra!

211
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,850
That one hit hard.

212
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,732
Synthesis!

213
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,199
Damn...

214
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,871
Naruto!

215
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,674
Wings!

216
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,360
You can fly?!

217
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,500
You let him get away.

218
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,628
I'm sorry. But...

219
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,630
It was my mistake for
leaving it to you.

220
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,594
But as for him,
he used the same Ninja Art as you.

221
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,933
What's the meaning of this?!

222
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,939
Only those who perform
the star training

223
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,023
can use that Ninja Art...

224
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,109
Then you're saying
he's someone from this village?

225
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,112
I don't know...

226
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm the one who let him get away.

227
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,713
I'll get the star back, no matter what!

228
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,738
The wind blows, Ah...

229
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,575
The pain,
The memories won't disappear

230
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,203
What should be brought along?

231
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,206
Assemble them into a piece.

232
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,168
There is no second chance, never

233
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,796
How foolish it is to throw away

234
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,091
Acting so innocently, Ah...

235
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,676
The images.

236
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:49,017
It probably will not end

237
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,314
It probably will not end

238
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,194
Burn that love-filled heart,

239
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,197
Sail across a thousand dreams

240
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,159
Running freely

241
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,871
To take hold of the world in hand

242
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,999
The clouds scatter

243
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,002
The sun sets yet again

244
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:22,550
The solo parade begins to move.

245
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,928
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,

246
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,307
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

247
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,109
I'm kind of bothered by
the village leader's attitude.

248
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,945
That the opponent used
the Ninja Art: Kujaku means...

249
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,115
Yeah, the attacker is definitely
a Shinobi from this village.

250
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,201
But, that old man didn't say anything.

251
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,119
It looks like there's some kind
of secret.

252
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,664
We need to investigate him.
Let's all split up.

253
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,832
Roger!

254
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,294
I'll get that star back,
no matter what.

255
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,714
Next: "The Remembered Lullaby"
