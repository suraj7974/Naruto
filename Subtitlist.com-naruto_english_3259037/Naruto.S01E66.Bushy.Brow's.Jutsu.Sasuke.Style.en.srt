1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,755
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,551
your uniqueness into strength

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,304
Even if you get lost,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,393
let's start walking

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,311
One more time

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,735
Are you really happy

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,697
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,871
Will you always have a great smile?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,708
Dreaming of only "the beginning,"

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,295
I wake up

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,259
and someday,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,763
I'll live on my own.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,767
Yes, precious things

15
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,979
are never in shape

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,649
You never know what it is

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,986
when you get it or lose it

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,324
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,328
your uniqueness into strength

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,873
Even if you get lost,

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,878
let's start walking

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,922
One more time

23
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,735
The rules are the same as
in the preliminaries.

24
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,823
The match goes on until one of you
dies or admits defeat.

25
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,201
When it's determined that
there's a winner,

26
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,870
the match can be stopped.

27
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,122
But that's my decision.

28
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,717
Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!

29
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,524
Hey Guy! You too, Lee...

30
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,068
Is your body all right?

31
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,987
Kakashi!

32
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,280
Kakashi Sensei!

33
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,578
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

34
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,915
You must've been worried.
Sorry for not contacting you at all...

35
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,588
Oh no, Sakura's gonna get really mad...

36
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,094
I don't really mind that.

37
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,364
It's hard to see from here...

38
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,576
Sasuke...

39
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,789
Kakashi Sensei...

40
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,917
Hm?

41
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,671
You know about the mark
on Sasuke's neck, don't you?

42
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,884
Is that...?

43
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,555
No need to worry.

44
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,392
A mark?

45
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,069
So, that's that.

46
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,613
Yup!

47
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,666
One... Two...

48
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,627
Three... Four...

49
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,046
Five...

50
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,549
Six... Seven...

51
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,594
Eight. Eight of them...

52
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,931
There are eight members of
Anbu Black Ops in this spacious arena...

53
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,433
Two platoons are too few...

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,728
What's Lord Hokage thinking?

55
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,983
Well...without knowing how or when
the opponent would make their move...

56
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,528
It can't be helped that the Anbu
are dispersed and deployed

57
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,738
in important areas in the village.

58
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,574
-Huh?
-It's about to begin.

59
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,703
We shouldn't let our guard down,
but for now...

60
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,956
We need to pay attention...
to this match.

61
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,003
Kakashi,

62
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:58,716
I'll be carefully checking out
what sort of training you gave him...

63
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,844
as your eternal rival!

64
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,682
Huh? Did you say something?

65
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:12,229
No! You're slick, Kakashi!

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,566
Why are you always so avant-garde?!

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,326
Both of you, to the middle!

68
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,971
Begin!

69
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,069
So this is the sand
Kakashi told me about...

70
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,204
Please don't get so mad...

71
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,128
Mother...

72
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,882
What's he talking about...?

73
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,344
Earlier...

74
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,265
Earlier I had you suck
awful-tasting blood.

75
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,767
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,814
But this time it'll likely...

77
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,692
taste good.

78
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:28,157
His conversation's started.
This is dangerous.

79
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,578
This is the first time I've seen Gaara
get like that before fighting.

80
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,956
So it must mean his opponent
is that imposing...

81
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,708
Him.

82
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,595
It appears he's calmed down.

83
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,020
Come on.

84
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,197
Hey...

85
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:15,162
Do you remember...
what he said yesterday?

86
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,043
At that time...

87
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,390
I will kill...you all without fail.

88
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,392
Just wait.

89
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,728
That's what he said...

90
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,482
But he didn't do it.

91
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,402
It was the perfect opportunity, but...

92
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,532
he didn't even see us.

93
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,582
Now, let me feel it!

94
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,293
We're...

95
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,296
unsatisfactory for him.

96
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,759
Right now, the only one who
can make him feel anything...

97
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,262
...is only Sasuke!

98
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,476
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself...

99
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,105
And if I see that all other people
in this world

100
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,190
exist only to make me realize that,

101
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,319
there could be no world more wonderful.

102
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,074
Naruto...

103
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,513
Here we go!

104
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,524
The Sand Shield became
a Sand Clone!

105
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,017
He's fast! This guy...
is just like that guy...

106
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:15,801
He's fast! It's nearly the same
as Lee's ordinary speed.

107
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,344
And...

108
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,262
It's overlapping with the image...

109
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,890
of my Taijutsu!

110
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,230
Is that the Sand Armor?

111
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,610
Come on!

112
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,915
Thank you, Anbu man.

113
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,170
So apparently, Hinata will be
all right for now if she rests.

114
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,173
Oh, is that right?

115
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,306
Huh? You know this person?
What're you taking about?

116
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,975
This person is an Anbu...

117
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,691
Not that, but at the examination...?
What do you mean?

118
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,575
Well, this is what it means...

119
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,192
Come on!

120
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,450
If you're not gonna come at me,
I'll go at you!

121
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,957
He's fast!

122
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,930
What's the matter? Is that it?

123
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,771
A-Amazing...

124
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,903
That armor...I'll tear it off.

125
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,292
His speed is basically the same
as Lee's with the weights removed.

126
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,256
It's... It's exactly like
Lee's Taijutsu.

127
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,508
His speed is also completely
different from before!

128
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,731
Sasuke... You are indeed
a genius beyond imagination.

129
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,362
How many years did it take me
to attain that speed...?

130
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,783
And you attained it in a mere month...!

131
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,590
However, it seems to consume
a lot of stamina

132
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,717
to continue that movement.

133
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,346
What's Gaara planning to do?

134
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,516
The sand armor uses up too
much Chakra...

135
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,185
It can't last for very long.

136
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,365
What the heck sort of training
did you do?!

137
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,450
Hm?

138
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,536
To get to that level in a mere month...

139
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,625
Sasuke had copied Lee's Taijutsu
with Sharingan.

140
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,503
So during the Taijutsu training...

141
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,381
I had Sasuke image Lee's movements.

142
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,514
Sasuke could make
that movement his own

143
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,683
only because he knew Lee.

144
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,687
Of course, Sasuke had to
work very hard for it.

145
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,441
But...with only that...

146
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,654
With only Taijutsu...
that Sand guy can't be taken down!

147
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,076
That Kakashi...

148
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,078
He must have seen the battle

149
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,914
between the hateful Gaara
and the lovable Lee.

150
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,339
Taijutsu that was taught suddenly

151
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,801
can't work against an opponent
that even Lee couldn't take down.

152
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,844
He should have known this only to well.

153
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,430
So if that's the case...

154
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,060
Why is it that he had Sasuke
master only Taijutsu?!

155
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,054
Why did I keep living?

156
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,727
But as long as you're alive,
you need a reason...

157
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,021
If you don't have one,
it's just the same as being dead.

158
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,316
What's this guy saying?!

159
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,823
So this is the answer I came to...

160
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,494
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

161
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,623
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,

162
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,375
finally, I became calm.

163
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,046
Oh?

164
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,256
Shikamaru...

165
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,844
We need to go over to where
Kakashi Sensei is right now!

166
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,388
What're you planning to do?

167
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:36,931
Hey!

168
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,851
I'm going to...

169
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,061
stop this match!

170
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,693
Gaara couldn't possibly be planning
to use that Jutsu!

171
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,990
So he used all the sand for protection...

172
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,493
I didn't think there could be this
much of a difference in the hardness

173
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,703
with a difference in the density
of the sand.

174
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,920
So it's absolute protection.

175
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,886
The sand...
It's covered his entire body.

176
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,806
This is somewhat troublesome.

177
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,851
Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!

178
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,647
Kakashi Sensei!

179
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,569
Naruto!

180
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,536
Huh? What do you want?

181
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,331
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!

182
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,547
That guy is totally different from us!

183
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,924
He's not normal!

184
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,387
Naruto...
What're you saying?

185
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,765
He lives to kill people.

186
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,850
In any case...

187
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,312
If this continues, Sasuke will die!

188
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,814
Jin, Saru,

189
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,068
Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru...

190
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,833
There's no mistake about it.
It's that Jutsu!

191
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:14,505
This isn't good!
Our plan isn't even on Gaara's mind.

192
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,674
Shoot!

193
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,093
Kakashi Sensei!

194
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,812
Everyone makes mistakes

195
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,067
It's nothing to be ashamed about

196
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,322
Don't let this scar be for naught

197
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:27,036
Walk with a smile

198
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,966
Yes, breathe in the air

199
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,635
Lift your face to the sky and jump

200
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,555
If it rains, take a break

201
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,057
Go where the wind takes you

202
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:53,146
So many regrets
Don't let this scar be for naught

203
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:58,234
Let's go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it's Show Time, life begins now.

204
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,614
Everyone makes mistakes

205
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:08,703
It's nothing to be ashamed about

206
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:14,042
Don't let this scar be for naught

207
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,297
Walk with a smile

208
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,594
Transform sadness into the wind

209
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,891
and continue to forge on

210
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:35,521
Forge on strong

211
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,534
Sasuke,

212
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,953
when I fought you once, I said

213
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,580
Even if one understands visually,

214
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,999
it's meaninless unless one
can move physically.

215
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,292
I was filled with
a sense of superiority.

216
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,505
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.

217
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,007
Moreover, you have...Sharingan!

218
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:08,054
Next time,
"Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!
The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!"

219
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,724
I am really envious of you, Sasuke!
